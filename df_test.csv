20618,Massachusetts Bets on a Vegas Casino,"The Encore Boston Harbor is massive, and a massive bet on gaming at a time when casino revenue has been fading.","Encore Boston Harbor casino and resort is across the Mystic River from the city, in Everett, Mass.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/12/travel/01bostonencore-night/01bostonencore-night-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=25ba9bbb53b84be4131026e759e273ae6baaa7a21879ee8d871378f7da3302ec&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/travel/wynn-casino-boston.html,48f488a8-5198-5685-a3b0-4131245eb392.jpg,"With 671 guest rooms, a 210,000 square-foot casino, more than 3,000 slot machines, a 37,000 square-foot ballroom, a 21,000 square-foot waterfront lawn and more than a dozen restaurants and bars, everything about the Encore Boston Harbor resort and casino is immense. That includes the wager its developer, Wynn Resorts, is placing on its success. The enterprise cost $2.6 billion dollars to build, at a time when many East Coast casinos are struggling. And the development had been shrouded in controversy for the last 13 months because of sexual harassment allegations against the company's founder. But state regulators on Tuesday gave Encore the go-ahead to open in June, as scheduled. The team behind the resort and casino said that it will thrive thanks to the proximity of Logan International Airport, the airport's increased traffic and ongoing expansion, and the many colleges and universities in the area. ""If you go downtown Boston you see nothing other than cranes,"" said Bob DeSalvio, president of Encore Boston Harbor. ""It's just on an incredible tear as far as economic development, so you know you add that all up, and the fact that we ended up with the sole license in eastern Massachusetts, and it's just a great recipe.""

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission released a report in early April saying that executives at Wynn Resorts helped hide sexual misconduct allegations against the company's billionaire founder, Steve Wynn. Mr. Wynn was forced to resign as the company's chairman and chief executive last year, after The Wall Street Journal published articles describing a pattern of sexual misconduct, including accusations that he had pressured employees for sex. On Tuesday, the commission said it would allow the developer to keep its casino license, paving the way for the property to open in June. It also fined the company $35 million and its chief executive, Matt Maddox, an additional $500,000. In an interview in Boston in April, Mr. DeSalvio emphasized Mr. Wynn's departure and said the company had transitioned from being ""founder-led"" to being ""team-oriented.""

""It's not about the man, it's about the brand and the brand has stood for quality, excellence and service for many many years,"" he said. ""When we survey our guests very few would have ever met Mr. Wynn. What they do know is what the brand stands for and that's something that will not change."" Everett is a working-class city of about 45,000 people and residents had mixed responses when the casino was first announced in 2014. But the company has committed to hiring about 6,000 people and to working with local businesses, as well as conducting a major environmental cleanup.

The building's 33-acre waterfront site was one of the most contaminated in the state -- the kind of place where people still talk about getting headaches from the toxins. Over 18 months, Encore pulled nearly a million tons of contaminated sediment from the area and the Mystic River. ""Awful stuff had been dumped and spilled, it was a train wreck of a site,"" said Elizabeth Henry, president of the Environmental League of Massachusetts. ""Nobody wanted to touch it because the environmental liabilities were expensive to touch."" Ms. Henry said that her organization -- a nonprofit supported by individual and foundation philanthropy, dues from citizens and organization members, and proceeds from special events -- rarely endorses projects, but supported the casino project because of its positive effect on the surrounding environment.

Patrick Chadwick, Encore's director of horticulture and floral, has chosen every tree and type of flower at the resort. Half of the gardens will be irrigated with rainwater runoff from the building. ""They've taken the physical building seriously in terms of sustainability,"" Ms. Henry said. ""It'll also be easier to walk around and bike to the casino and through to some of the adjacent neighborhoods. They've doubled down on interconnectivity and so, in a way, that benefits the whole community."" The Encore's rooms range from about $500 to about $2,000 per night, depending on season, demand and room type. The smallest room is 650 square feet and the largest -- a two-story villa with three bedrooms -- is 5,800 square feet. Some rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows, a view of Boston Harbor and the city's skyline. ""I hope when I design these places that an elegant couple in a tuxedo encounters a really young couple in jeans and a T-shirt on their way crossing on the staircase,"" said Roger Thomas, Wynn Resorts executive vice president of design. ""I think that's an important thing to have happen -- I like everybody looking at everybody."""

The Six Senses Duxton, a 49-room boutique hotel that opened in April in Singapore, was the company's first hotel in that city and its first in an urban environment. (That is, until the December opening of its sister property in Singapore, the Six Senses Maxwell). Operated by the Bangkok-based Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas, which now has two hotels , 15 resorts and 31 spas in 21 countries , the Duxton was created within eight three-story, early 19th-century shop houses in Chinatown. It was refurbished by the British interior designer Anouska Hempel with plush chinoiserie furnishings and decor that gives a big nod to the neighborhood's distant past. At check-in at the two Singapore hotels, guests are cajoled into a ""singing bowl"" ritual that involves standing with your eyes closed while a therapist strikes a metal bowl with a wooden wand at your ""crown chakra"" so the sound vibrations can bring you ""harmony and health."" Your welcome gift bag includes the herbal ointment Tiger Balm and Chinese po chai pills for indigestion. A receptionist contacts you before check-in to see if you'd like to schedule a free consultation with a traditional Chinese medicine doctor.

In the heart of Singapore's old Chinatown, the hotel is surrounded by both hawker centers (outdoor food courts) and bars and restaurants beloved by locals, as well as attractions such as the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. It's a few minutes' walk from local train stations, and a 10- to 15-minute taxi ride to the financial district and Orchard Road, Singapore's main shopping area."
36801,New York Attorney General Expands Inquiry Into Net Neutrality Comments,The office is investigating the source of more than 22 million public comments submitted to the F.C.C. during the battle over internet regulation.,"""The F.C.C.'s public comment process was corrupted by millions of fake comments,"" Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood of New York said in a statement.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/17/business/17NETNEUTRALITY01/17NETNEUTRALITY01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=534413cbafbd02cc24d3798c911ca1d871cfd78c9c8169ab07be403ca1555ff1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/technology/net-neutrality-inquiry-comments.html,1ae8faa8-4476-5d88-9dde-5d2864549bad.jpg,"The New York attorney general subpoenaed more than a dozen telecommunications trade groups, lobbying contractors and Washington advocacy organizations on Tuesday, seeking to determine whether the groups submitted millions of fraudulent public comments to sway a critical federal decision on internet regulation, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation. Some of the groups played a highly public role in last year's battle, when the Federal Communications Commission voted to revoke rules that classified internet service providers as public utilities. The regulations, made under President Barack Obama, were meant to guarantee full and equal access to the internet, a principle known as net neutrality. The telecommunications industry bitterly opposed them and enthusiastically backed a repeal under President Trump. The attorney general, Barbara D. Underwood, is investigating the source of more than 22 million public comments submitted to the F.C.C. during the battle over the regulations. Millions of comments were provided using temporary or duplicate email addresses, while others recycled identical phrases. Seven popular comments, repeated verbatim, accounted for millions more. The noise from the fake or orchestrated comments appears to have broadly favored the telecommunications industry: One recent study, by a researcher at Stanford, found that virtually all of the unique comments submitted to the F.C.C. -- the ones most likely to be bona fide -- opposed repeal.

In September, The New York Times sued the F.C.C. to obtain digital records that would help trace the source of the public comments. The case is continuing. Most strikingly, many comments on net neutrality were falsely submitted under the names of real people, in what amounted to mass acts of virtual identity theft. Some comments used the name of dead people. Ms. Underwood's investigators have estimated that almost half of all of the comments -- more than nine million -- used stolen identities. The investigation has traced comments submitted through bulk uploads and through an F.C.C. service that allows advocates to solicit public comments on their own websites and then transmit them to the agency. Investigators have identified four buckets of apparently fraudulent comments, each of which appears to have been associated with a particular network of advocacy organizations, trade groups and consultants, including at least some on both sides of the debate. ""The F.C.C.'s public comment process was corrupted by millions of fake comments,"" Ms. Underwood said in a statement. ""The law protects New Yorkers from deception and the misuse of their identities. My office will get to the bottom of what happened and hold accountable those responsible for using stolen identities to distort public opinion on net neutrality."" The companies and groups subpoenaed on Tuesday, according to the person with knowledge of the investigation, include Broadband for America, Century Strategies and MediaBridge. Broadband for America is a coalition supported by cable and telecommunications companies; Century Strategies is a political consultancy founded by Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian Coalition; and MediaBridge is a conservative messaging firm whose website boasts of helping to place hundreds of thousands of comments on net neutrality during Mr. Obama's presidency on behalf of one client.

In a statement, Century Strategies said it did not reveal the identity of clients as a matter of policy but defended its advocacy work. It said Ms. Underwood should focus her investigation on fraudulent comments submitted by groups supporting net neutrality. ""We have worked to encourage citizens to contact government officials to oppose government regulation of the internet,"" the statement said. ""We have directed our partners and vendors to follow above-industry standards and protections, including requiring individuals to provide name, address, email and phone number to verify who they are. We perform extensive data validation to verify all names and addresses using public databases."" Ms. Underwood, according to the person familiar with the investigation, also demanded records and communications from a collection of nonprofits, consultants and vendors that her office has linked to the Center for Individual Freedom. The center, an advocacy group created in the 1990s by a former tobacco lobbyist, set up efforts last year that yielded thousands of identical comments to the F.C.C. Records are also being sought from a Republican consulting firm called Vertical Strategies. The attorney general is also seeking records from several pro-neutrality groups, including Free Press and Fight for the Future, a group that advocates for digital rights. Those groups are chiefly funded by foundations and individuals. Tim Karr, senior director of strategy and communications at Free Press, said his group would cooperate with Ms. Underwood. ""We are responding to their requests and welcome this inquiry into the F.C.C.'s net neutrality comment process,"" he said. The net neutrality battle thrust a spotlight onto the grimy but increasingly high-tech world of regulatory influence campaigns, in which industry and advocacy groups try to build a record of public support or opposition for proposed policies. Federal agencies and commissions that issue regulations are generally required to circulate them for public comment, creating an incentive to inundate agencies with millions of scripted comments that purport to come from real people. Digital messaging firms can generate thousands or millions of authentic-seeming comments. Some use software to build unique-seeming comments out of related phrases and words."
47190,"In Rio, the Work Goes in Before the Party Goes On","Samba schools in Rio de Janeiro are more like social clubs, fulcrums of community spirit tucked deep into a neighborhood, many in ramshackle favelas.","Samba parades for all seasons, and reasons, in and around Rio de Janeiro.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/31/travel/31SAMBA1/31SAMBA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=698bc967b36311f3ba6fc2f0a27815a26021f8c4fc3572bf28ee82bc0ed539f0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/travel/rio-de-janeiro-brazil-samba.html,866ae52c-c304-595a-9194-07d09cf5a59f.jpg,"In Rio, the Work Goes in Before the Party Goes On

Near midnight on a steamy weeknight in January, midsummer in Brazil, a stretch of Estrada do Galeao in Rio de Janeiro was closed to traffic. On the crowded sidewalk, in the ghoulish light of streetlamps and shadows, vendors sold beer in bottles and meats on sticks. Above the graffiti-marked doors of storefronts shuttered until morning, silhouettes stood on balconies and in windows. Drums, hundreds of them, pulsed to life. A slow wave of smiling, dancing people snaked slowly down the street, bursting into a song that they had practiced for months. In four weeks, Uniao da Ilha, one of the most respected samba schools in Rio, would perform in the world-famous Carnaval at the Sambodromo a few miles away. The skinny, half-mile-long arena would be filled with more than 72,000 people. Millions would watch on television. Uniao da Ilha's 3,400 performers -- dancers, singers, drummers -- and its six large, themed floats would be examined by judges in the arena and countless critics everywhere else, then ranked among 11 other top-division samba schools.

Only one can win Carnaval. Uniao da Ilha never has. The final weeks of preparation were a frenzy of work and worry. At Cidade do Samba (Samba City), an enormous complex like a movie-studio back lot, Uniao da Ilha and its rivals scrambled to complete their floats and thousands of costumes. Every day, Cidade do Samba was a riot of active construction verbs -- painting, gluing, sawing, welding, taping, screwing, cutting, sewing. But in the evening, back in the quiet of the neighborhood, it was time for Uniao da Ilha to rehearse this year's song, ""Olympic in Nature,"" a theme chosen for the Summer Games that are coming to Rio in August. ""Ilha! Razao do meu viver!"" (""Island! Reason I live!"") everyone shouted, arms waving in unison, at the song's end. With barely a pause in the drums or a breath for the singers, the song repeated, echoing relentlessly through the neighborhood on a 90-minute loop. At Carnaval, schools have 82 minutes to parade, meaning that songs are performed in succession roughly 30 times. The rehearsal parade moved slowly down the street, each of the school's 31 sections (about 100 people assigned to each) distinguished by matching T-shirts or other rehearsal gear, like the African-influenced headscarves on the older, whirling women called baianas. When it came time for Carnaval, they would don enormous hoop skirts, 6.6 yards in circumference at the ankles and weighing more than 80 pounds. The song's melody came from ukulele-like cavaquinhos, overwhelmed by a battery of drummers banging furiously on an array of percussive instruments. The basslike surdo, the heartbeat of any samba song, set the pace. The plate-size, tinny tamborim, struck rapidly with a stick -- often two-pronged, like a snake's tongue -- escalated the volume and chaos.

Every year, at some point, Mr. Cerqueira momentarily believes that Uniao da Ilha will not make it. ""Today is that time,"" he said with a tired smile. The term ""samba school"" is a misnomer. Samba is not taught there. Samba schools are social clubs, really, fulcrums of community spirit tucked deep into a neighborhood, many in ramshackle favelas. Most Cariocas, or people from Rio, have two allegiances: one to a soccer team, one to a samba school. Like soccer teams, each has a logo and colors. The biggest of the roughly 200 samba schools compete in Carnaval, the festival of celebration tied to the Lenten calendar, highlighted by the unique spectacle of its samba parades. This year, six first-division schools are to parade on Feb. 7, the other six on Feb. 8. The parades are an orgy for the senses -- giant floats with moving parts, thousands of dancers in full costumes, earsplitting music, gut-thumping drums, heart-lifting choruses. Over most of a year, every school conjures a theme, writes a samba song and mashes it together into a circus of color and joy. And feathers. Lots of feathers.

""If there are seven arts, with cinema being No. 7, then Carnaval is No. 8,"" said Milton Cunha, known in Brazil as an eccentric Globo television commentator and a former carnavalesco, the term for the samba school art directors widely recognized for their annual creations. On a recent Saturday afternoon, Mr. Cunha sat at the rail of a balcony at Mangueira, one of Rio's most popular schools -- in a Rio de Janeiro soccer analogy, the Flamengo of samba. Mangueira's pink-and-green building, typical of samba schools, is a two-story fortress surrounding an enormous courtyard that serves as a dance hall. Below Mr. Cunha, more than a thousand people pulsed to the beat of a band on a stage. Conversation was nearly impossible over the music and the singing. Sweat dripped from even those standing still. The event was a feijoada, a fund-raiser common to all samba schools. More than 1,500 people came to Mangueira in the afternoon and were fed feijoada, a traditional stew of black beans, white rice and chunks of beef and pork. They stayed and danced deep into the night in a sweltering box. Mangueira's metal roof was retractable, and when it opened, like cracking a lid to let the steam out, it revealed Mangueira's backdrop, a hillside favela that envelops the school on three sides. ""Samba is the art of the poor people,"" said Aydano Andre Motta, a journalist who has covered Carnaval for decades and written books on the subject. ""It is the one thing that is organized in their lives. It centers these neighborhoods.""

""It is a Broadway show, but with no rehearsal,"" said Paulo Barros, now the best-known carnavalesco, who creates the theme, writes the story, designs floats and costumes and oversees production. ""We work all year for a show that happens one time, for a parade that last 82 minutes."" Mr. Barros's productions for various samba schools have won Carnaval three times. Top carnavalescos like Mr. Barros often move from school to school, like coaches of professional sports teams, and can command annual salaries of 1 million Brazilian reais (roughly $250,000 and sinking with Brazil's economy); this year he is working with Portela. In the months before Carnaval, they oversee roughly 200 workers creating floats and costumes. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Barros stood inside Portela's sweltering Samba City operation, consumed by the smells of glue and paint and the sounds of power tools and hammers. For Portela this year, Mr. Barros had chosen a time-travel theme, a trip through Earth's history led by the school's eagle mascot. There was a float that evoked Greek ruins, another for Egypt and another for Eldorado, the lost city of gold. There was Gulliver, about 100 feet long and lying on his back, wearing Converse All-Stars, and an archaeological dig in which dinosaurs, Mr. Barros said, will come to life midparade and eat the scientists. And there was a silver spaceship inspired by the television series ""Lost in Space,"" circled with dozens of robot suits that will be filled by dancers during the parade. It was the only one of the floats that looked finished. ""My goal is to be ready for Carnaval 15 days before,"" Mr. Barros said. ""It's impossible in Brazil."" Tia Bene has been a twirling baiana at Uniao da Ilha since 1953, when her husband and some friends formed the samba school. She is 85 now, her face deeply contoured. After the rehearsal parade on Estrada do Galeao ended, she sat outside with friends who poured beer from bottles and munched on French fries from a nearby stand. They had been practicing for this Carnaval parade every Wednesday and Saturday night since June.

""At the parade, there are fireworks to announce when the next school is coming,"" Ms. Bene said. ""And when I hear them, I still cry, even after all these years."" Schools, open to visitors, have unique personalities. Salgueiro, a longtime samba power, feels relatively wealthy -- the red-and-white walls of its dance floor are lined with electric sponsor signs, a gift shop sells souvenirs, and buses idle down the street, waiting to take tourists back to their beach-front hotels. Imperatriz, bathed in green, has more of a neighborhood vibe. On the spectrum of flash, the blue-tinged Portela sits somewhere between. The biggest schools have Carnaval budgets of roughly 10 million reais (about $2.5 million). The city and state of Rio de Janeiro give top schools 1 million reais in seed money, doubled this year to help the schools combat Brazil's collapsing economy. Globo, the media company, and Petrobras, the scandal-embroiled state oil company, pump support into the schools, too. But historically, an untold chunk of money for some schools has come from jogo do bicho (animal game), an underground lottery in many neighborhoods run by mafia-like kingpins. When Beija-Flor won for the first time in 1976, it brazenly portrayed jogo do bicho in its parade. Now it is a samba power.

While commercialism has invaded Carnaval (tourism officials claim an infusion of 3 billion reais into the economy), the samba schools still feel like mom-and-pop operations. It raises the question of why social clubs in poor Rio neighborhoods spend so much time, energy and money on something so seemingly frivolous as a parade. ""I have no answer for this,"" Andre Bonatti, the cultural director at Imperatriz, said with a laugh. He paused, then continued: ""You don't think just about the financial investment. You think about the human investment. We have some professionals working here. But more important are the thousands of people in the parade. They don't have salaries. But they have love."" Brazil's withering economy has forced schools to cut costs, even recycling feathers and fabric from last year's productions. Restraint may not be obvious during this year's spectacle, but most schools are using one or two fewer floats and a few hundred fewer people. Some have suggested that the effect on Carnaval might be a good thing. Jose Inacio dos Santos, one of samba's top composers under the artistic name Ze Katimba, was a founder of Imperatriz in 1959. He misses the old days, when winning schools touched hearts with emotion rather than trying to dazzle eyes with production. But receding budgets mean fewer floats, fewer participants and a chance to slow the songs without worrying whether the beat will move the giant procession through Sambodromo in the allotted time. ""This year we'll have about 3,300 people, a bit smaller, so we don't have to hurry,"" said Ze Katimba, whose song for Imperatriz this year is several beats per minute slower than usual. ""People can slow down, be more moved."" Samba songs start as melodic ballads, often written for string instruments, but become something vastly different when hundreds of drums and thousands of voices are added. Mestre Cica is Uniao da Ilha's master of percussion, overseeing a battery of 280 drums playing a song at 145 beats per minute, a bit slower than usual.

He began to sing ""Is Today the Day?,"" a Uniao da Ilha song from 1982 considered a classic. It sounded like a lullaby. ""I wish we still had great samba songs like that,"" he said. Days later, on a steamy Sunday night, Uniao da Ilha took its turn with its one allowed rehearsal inside the Sambodromo. The floats and costumes were still at Samba City, under construction, but under bright fluorescent stadium lights, more than 3,000 people in 31 sections marched down the 800-meter strip, as wide as a two-lane road, with a dashed line down the middle. There were so many people shimmying down the track that the ones in front reached the end before the ones in back even began. In a few weeks, those same people would be festooned with costumes amid audacious floats. The stands would be packed. Judges would scour for missteps and sour notes. Cameras would send the images across Brazil and around the world. And when the fireworks go off to introduce Uniao da Ilha, deep inside the section of baianas, an 85-year-old woman in a cumbersome hoop skirt might just shed a tear. It's only 11 miles from the samba school to the Sambodromo, but it can feel much farther."

Genetic tests showed that the virus in both women was more than 98 percent identical, all but proving that one had infected the other, according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In numerous previous studies of women who thought they might have been infected by other women, either no genetic testing was done or the newly infected women reported other activity that could have been the cause, such as recent sex with men, drug injection or transfusions.

The women in the new case, both in their 40s, lived in Houston when the transmission took place in 2012. The infected partner had been on treatment for H.I.V. from early 2009 to late 2010 but had stopped taking the drugs. The women reported having sex during their periods and using insertive sex toys, sometimes so roughly that bleeding occurred."
59784,Hybrid Strategy: Divide and Conquer,"Honda is broadening its hybrid strategy by improving its existing single-motor system, adding a new two-motor system and developing a three-motor system aimed at high performance and improved handling.","PERFORMER Concept version of Acura's NSX, a hybrid that will have three electric motors.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/30/automobiles/30GRTK/30GRTK-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=220&w=600&s=8475694c0a5e13f8bdaa929a8b1a89372449ac6ef6ea740acbc49354f4b9ae32&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/automobiles/hybrid-strategy-divide-and-conquer.html,7ec0475e-e133-5c76-aa7d-f95c285390b7.jpg,"BOTH Honda and Toyota are far more committed to the hybrid car than to the battery electric vehicle, a fact that Toyota made clear this month when it scaled back its Scion iQ electric car project. And Honda is so enthusiastic about hybrids that, as its chief executive, Takanobu Ito, outlined in a recent speech, it will have three separate systems with up to three electric motors.

Honda is broadening its hybrid strategy. It is improving its existing single-motor system to make it simpler and less expensive. It is adding a new two-motor system to challenge the Chevrolet Volt and add plug-in hybrid capability to its arsenal. And it is developing a three-motor system aimed at high performance and improved handling.

Does Honda need three hybrid systems? It makes sense if the company can build exciting cars to take advantage of the engineering. A range of solutions matches costs to market realities: simpler systems at the lower end and more complex designs upmarket, where higher prices can absorb the added costs.

The venerable Integrated Motor Assist system, as seen in various guises on cars like the Insight and Civic Hybrid, relies mainly on the gasoline engine, drawing on the electric motor for extra power during acceleration. When the car slows, the slim electric motor, sandwiched between the gas engine and the transmission, turns into a generator to send electricity to the battery pack."

The Fox News website Fox Nation, which apparently liked the video enough to repost it, also took it down this week, calling it ""inappropriate"" and expressing regret.

There were the online platforms like Facebook, Reddit and, as my colleague Kevin Roose reported this week, Discord, which shut themselves off from the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who had been using the sites to spread their hateful message and to organize. And then there was The Associated Press, which made the thoughtful editorial judgment to avoid using the term ""alt-right,"" a neat bit of branding created to ""disguise racist aims,"" the A.P. said. Other news organizations should do the same. It may come as a relief that people in high places in the media and technology world decided it was no longer tenable to give extra oxygen -- digital and financial -- to those who worship the champions of slavery or march under the Nazi flag, glorifying one of the most morally reprehensible regimes in history. But it is truly remarkable that it only happened now, after the nation had to witness a white supremacist rally gone wrong, a latter-day Munich Beer Hall Putsch in miniature. And it was a resounding answer to what should be an easy hypothetical question, easier than the ""baby Hitler"" conundrum: Would you facilitate the publication of Hitler's newspaper, Volkischer Beobachter, and provide him the means to organize his movement? It started as a joke, after all.

But moves to stanch certain kinds of content also clash with the spirit of the First Amendment and, more to the point, the free-speech ethos that is so ingrained in the web. That ethos has been the game-changer, and often for the good. Unlike the last big communications revolutions -- brought about with radio and then television -- this one came with no barrier to entry in terms of expensive equipment like towers and studios. There have been no governmental limits like broadcasting standards and licensing requirements. That has democratized information, giving rise to new political and social movements as well as to a phalanx of innovative media ventures that have diminished the traditional gatekeeper role of the mainstream media. It gave anyone with an internet connection an opportunity to have his or her voice heard widely via Facebook or Twitter, Reddit or Medium.

The trouble has come in finding the line between what some may find offensive and what is objectively dangerous speech. YouTube shut down The Daily Stormer. But I had no trouble finding a recording of Thursday's edition of ""David Duke Radio"" on YouTube, or, for that matter, the latest audio from ""Stormfront Radio,"" which is connected to an older supremacist site. Twitter has sought to ban or suspend accounts of brazen online troublemakers like the former Breitbart star Milo Yiannopoulos, yet it struggled to keep up with the frenzied attempts from the left and right to use the site to identify opposing demonstrators and make their lives miserable. In at least a couple of cases those attempts resulted in harassment campaigns against people who were nowhere near the rally. Then again, the efforts to police content can go too far. Mixed in with complaints from right-wing provocateurs who have already been shut down are serious conservative fears that the moves will result in censorship for right-leaning political thought. The challenge for all sides was laid bare last fall when Facebook removed a post of Nick Ut's Pulitzer Prize winning photo of children, including a naked girl, fleeing a napalm attack. The conversation needs to continue. It can't only be had at the height of a crisis, and it can't only be relegated to social media. But at this point, if we can't set a line at neo-Nazis and white nationalists inciting hatred and violence, can we set any line at all?"

Semenya's natural testosterone levels are far above the standard female range.

The ruling by the Swiss Supreme Court was a victory for World Athletics, track's governing body, in a highly charged case about biological sex, gender identity and fair play. The organization had passed regulations in 2018 stating that intersex athletes who have a disorder of sexual development and have both X and Y chromosomes, the standard male pattern, would have to lower their testosterone levels to keep competing in women's events from the quarter mile to the mile, which combine speed and endurance.

World Athletics has acknowledged that its regulations were discriminatory but said they were necessary to preserve a level playing field in women's events. Intersex athletes with testosterone in the male range, the governing body argued, have an unfair advantage in lean muscle mass, strength and oxygen-carrying capacity. The lowest level in the male testosterone range is four times greater than the highest level in the women's range, according to the governing body.

In 2019, the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport, or CAS, ruled 2-1 in favor of the restrictions placed on athletes in some female track events. Semenya then appealed to the Swiss Supreme Court."
20337,This Estonian Start-Up Has Become a Thorn in Uber's Side,The Estonian ride-hailing company Bolt is an unexpected success story. The start-up points to Uber's global challenges.,"Based in Estonia, Bolt has become Uber's most formidable challenger in Europe and Africa.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/17/business/00bolt-5/00bolt-5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=67e4c1fc24bf6fa2d53420d548c3a0a94320de284e2197f9980aa16a2e000793&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/technology/bolt-taxify-uber-lyft.html,aa2d13c8-38ff-5d78-88af-d591befe5289.jpg,"TALLINN, Estonia -- Uber used to dominate ride-hailing in Poland and Kenya. Over the past two years, that started to change. In Poland, a small competitor opened a rival service and began winning customers with cheaper fares and attracting drivers by charging lower commissions. In Kenya, that same upstart grabbed business by offering motorbike rides and letting passengers pay using a popular mobile payments provider. In both countries, Uber responded by spending more money on new incentives to entice customers and drivers. The rival that put Uber on the defensive is called Bolt. Based in Estonia, it was founded six years ago by a 19-year-old college dropout, Markus Villig. Since then, the company has turned into an unexpected success story by becoming Uber's most formidable challenger in Europe and Africa.

""Transportation is a completely different space,"" Mr. Villig, now 25, said in an interview at Bolt's offices inside a former furniture warehouse in Estonia's capital. ""You will have these regional champions."" He added that Uber did not make Eastern Europe and Africa a priority because ""they have bigger battles elsewhere."" Bolt is an example of a troublesome trend for Uber, the world's largest ride-hailing company, which is set to go public next month at a valuation of as much as $100 billion. Everywhere Uber turns, a conveyor belt of new antagonists keeps emerging around the globe. In India, Uber is battling a service called Ola. In Brazil, it is dueling Didi Chuxing, a Chinese company that bought the local ride-hailing operator 99 last year. (Uber owns a stake in Didi.) And newfangled transportation companies, such as electric scooter providers, have popped up.

The multifront battle means that Uber, which is already spending billions of dollars to compete in 700 cities around the world, cannot afford to relax and cut back on costs as its opponents chip away at its growth. The company, which lost about $1.8 billion and spent about $14.3 billion last year, is set to continue losing money for the foreseeable future. That may be compounded as Uber's rivals become more aggressive. Bolt is now planning to confront Uber in one of its most lucrative cities: London. The smaller firm is reapplying for a taxi license to operate in the British capital after regulators there rebuffed it in 2017. A prolonged battle in London, which is Uber's biggest market in Europe and one of the few places it has been profitable, could be financially bruising.

If Bolt appears as if it came out of nowhere, that is partly because the company -- and its founder -- were under the radar for years. Mr. Villig grew up on a sparsely populated island called Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea and moved to the capital, Tallinn, when he was 7. By age 10, he said, he knew he wanted a career in technology. In high school, he built websites for local businesses. Mr. Villig drew inspiration from the success of Skype, the internet-calling service now owned by Microsoft, whose original engineering team was in Estonia. One member of that team was Mr. Villig's older brother, Martin, who now works at Bolt.

In 2013, Mr. Villig started Bolt, initially named Taxify, after dropping out of college and mustering the courage to ask his parents to let him use the few thousand euros that had been saved for his tuition. He had been frustrated by Estonia's taxi service and didn't expect Uber to become available anytime soon in a country that some Americans cannot find on a map. (Estonia is west of Russia, south of Finland.) Raising money from his parents turned out to be easier than persuading venture capitalists to invest in Taxify. A few local investors, including alumni from Skype, ultimately backed the new firm. But Mr. Villig was rejected by dozens of others who figured Uber would squash him. ""It was just a taxi app in Tallinn; you couldn't see it was going to be big,"" said Rain Rannu, an investor in Estonia who was one of the first to put money into Bolt. As for Mr. Villig, Mr. Rannu said, ""he was just out of high school."" Bolt focused on working with taxi companies before switching to a business more like Uber's: offering rides through a smartphone app and using unlicensed drivers. The company homed in on markets in Eastern Europe, the Baltics and Africa where Mr. Villig felt Uber wasn't making a big effort.

Bolt's long-term success is far from assured. Like Uber and Lyft, it loses money. For every $10 it makes in fares, Bolt loses about $1 because of the cost of expanding to new markets and offering incentives to riders and drivers, Mr. Villig said. But that is less than Uber and Lyft, he added. He said Bolt was on a pace to have more than $1 billion in total bookings this year and could break even if it slowed down its expansion plans. He hopes to take the company public in three to five years. Bolt also is more frugal than Uber, Mr. Villig said. The company spends about half as much on an engineer who works in its offices in Estonia and Romania than it would in California, he calculated. The company also saves money by forgoing a large research department. Instead, it posts Facebook ads for drivers to help it decide which cities to open in. Bolt focuses on areas that get big responses. The company keeps most support operations centralized in Estonia and hires just three to five employees in each country it operates. And Mr. Villig said he had no interest in spending on autonomous vehicles. Even so, Bolt faces challenges. Uber has vanquished many rivals and will add as much as $10 billion to its coffers from its initial public offering. Bolt also has many of the same labor and regulatory challenges that Uber has grappled with over the past decade. In Africa, payment fraud has been a consistent problem. Yet Mr. Villig said that even if Bolt disappeared, new rivals to Uber would emerge. Uber's ""becoming more dominant is not going to happen,"" he said. ""There isn't any geography in the world where they will have a monopoly."""
8519,Waking Up in 2030,The suspended time of the pandemic has put history on fast-forward.,Wall Street in New York on June 4.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/28/opinion/28douthat1/28douthat1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ee73be96af628ea406148d88a0cd60599e9b32208936f2be42d49272ab41798c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/opinion/sunday/us-coronavirus-2030.html,4be44165-42a3-55c4-9da9-ece97e06eb60.jpg,"There is something peculiar about time during the pandemic. On the one hand there's a feeling that the normal calendar has simply stopped, school schedules and sports seasons evaporating, one homebound day passing much like another. It's a feeling of hiatus, intermission, like the days between Christmas and the new year, or some extra season invented by a Renaissance pope to fix a lagging calendar. Yet at the same time there's a feeling of acceleration, of changes that might have otherwise dragged out across a decade piling one atop the other. The George Floyd protests and their electoral consequences, the transformation of liberal institutions by internal agitation, the changes happening to cities and corporations and colleges and churches -- in each case, trends that were working slowly have seemingly speeded up. This means that when the coronavirus era finally ends, there will be a Rip Van Winkle feeling -- a sense of having been asleep and waking to normality, except that we will have time-traveled and the normality will resemble the year 2030 as it might have been without the virus, rather than just a simple turn to 2021 or 2022.

What will this 2030-in-2022 look like? First, certain key cultural institutions will be increasingly consolidated and concentrated, academia and journalism especially. In the newspaper industry much of this process happened already, but Covid is delivering a swifter coup de grace to midsize daily newspapers and online start-ups, and handing advantages to a few national entities (ahem) that they might have otherwise taken five or 10 more years to gain.

In higher education a similar transformation is being pulled forward: Colleges were expecting a grim landscape in the later 2020s, because 2010s birthrates were so low, but now a decline in foreign enrollment and an acceleration of online learning will threaten marginal state schools and possibly close small liberal-arts colleges much sooner. (The coronavirus experience is also likely to push birthrates still lower, delaying any higher ed recovery by years or decades more.) The likely winners will be the prestige schools and big state campuses, who will have the resources to survive and expand and the name brands to leverage in new online markets -- though so long as pandemic fears keeps kids close to home, the state schools may gain some ground at the prestige schools' expense. In religion, the pandemic may strengthen certain forms of faith, but that won't save institutional churches from what Fordham's David Gibson calls a ""religion recession"" caused by falling donations and shrunken attendance. Smaller churches may suffer most, for the same tight-margins, high-overhead reasons that restaurants are going under. But big religious bodies like Roman Catholicism and the Southern Baptists will probably decline as well, in a hurried-up version of the decay that awaited them with the next decade's worth of generational turnover. (Any Catholic diocese that had a 10-year plan for closing or consolidating schools or parishes, for instance, can expect to do the same thing but much faster.) In politics, similarly, what was likely to be a slow-motion leftward shift, as the less-married, less-religious, more ethnically diverse younger generation gained more power, is being accelerated nationally by the catastrophes of the Trump administration, which is putting states in play for Democrats five or 10 years early.

A political shift is certainly accelerating within elite institutions, where the younger generation is trying to establish a new ideological consensus, a new set of standards and boundaries for behavior and opinion, that otherwise would have advanced more slowly, with more contestation, over the next 10 years. (That these institutions are subject to the consolidating forces described above makes the battle to control them more important, and the professional stakes more fraught.) Finally in corporate America, there may be trends toward both consolidation and dispersal. The former, because even federal intervention probably won't prevent small businesses from going under while bigger businesses ride things out, accelerating the pre-existing drift toward a less entrepreneurial, more monopolist America. But the latter, because the remote-work experience, pandemic fears and possibly-rising crime rates may encourage more companies to abandon the great consolidated hubs of the digital age, or at least fling more satellite campuses out to Idaho and Iowa and other lower-cost-of-living states, dispersing talent back into the heartland for the first time in two generations. Of the trends I've described, only this last one seems like a hopeful sign that post-pandemic America might become less sclerotic, less decadent than the America of 2019. If one wanted to be especially optimistic, one could add that maybe -- maybe -- a corporate dispersal will reduce social stratification, and help create new intellectual, journalistic and even religious centers. But overall, the pandemic seems likely to bring us more quickly to a future of consolidated power, weakened human-scale institutions and growing ideological conformity. Along with far too many lives, that's what's likely to be lost in this strange between-time: a decade's worth of chances to take an off-ramp, choose a different direction, or just stand athwart 2030 yelling stop.

34008,"Beach Is in This California Town's Name, but It Offers Much More","Long Beach has a cute and compact downtown, good food, ethnic and cultural diversity, a thriving L.G.B.T. community, and some unparalleled wildlife viewing opportunities.",A Harbor Breeze cruise ship leaving Long Beach Harbor.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/29/travel/29frugal-longbeach1/merlin_139371558_baacd260-0144-489d-8494-f9764237aedd-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=136419d0c1a30802d4368ab2a58b14b3ec4c7726a83c699deb8fad8e842b5bce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/travel/long-beach-budget.html,a324ed7a-7d45-5b2c-a4b0-c5a8c120306a.jpg,"Beach Is in This California Town's Name, but It Offers Much More

The word ""discover"" is always a misnomer when used by travelers: when a place is new to you, that doesn't mean it's new to everyone else. This was reinforced recently in the midst of my excitement exploring a dynamic midsize city close to where I live in Los Angeles, one with roughly the population of Miami or Kansas City. No, I'm not referring to San Diego nor Palm Springs. I'm talking about Long Beach, Calif., a port city less than 20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. It's got a cute and compact downtown, good food, ethnic and cultural diversity, a thriving L.G.B.T. community, and some unparalleled wildlife viewing opportunities. It is, in short, a city entirely worthy of anyone's time -- and I have no one to blame but myself for not realizing it sooner. I spent a few days last month exploring Long Beach by foot, car and bike, and left feeling like I had plenty more to explore. Even better, I was able to have a great time without spending much cash. Long Beach certainly thrives on ocean culture but, contrary to what its name might imply, the draw isn't necessarily surf and sand -- there are better beaches nearby. Instead, expect to enjoy the shoreline in other ways: waterside eating and drinking establishments, boat trips and bike rides along the ocean.

I picked up a Groupon for Harbor Breeze Cruises, spending just $36.80 for two tickets (down from a walk-up price of $90) for a 150-minute ocean cruise and whale-watching tour. My girlfriend and I boarded the big catamaran hoping for the best. It didn't look good initially. Undulating gently in the Pacific Ocean with a couple dozen other locals and tourists, we were treated to little more than a pleasure cruise during the first two-thirds of the trip. But then those of us on deck heard it -- the distinctive sound of air and water blasting through a whale's blowhole, like a short burst of television static. From our location about halfway between the shore and Santa Catalina Island, we spotted two long, slender, grayish bodies of fin whales, the second largest mammals on earth, bobbing gently like apples in a barrel at 2 o'clock off the starboard bow. Each emitted a powerful blast or two from their blowhole s before disappearing under the water with little warning -- our guide on board explained that fin whales don't make a big show of their tails before taking a deep dive. We spotted a few groups of two to three whales, then cruised for another few minutes to a different spot, where we saw at least a half-dozen more. The massive and enchanting creatures lolled gently before snorting indignantly a few times and submerging; they seemed entirely unconcerned with us humans. As a bonus sighting, a pod of dolphins joined alongside our boat on the way back to shore.

Long Beach's outdoor delights can be enjoyed by boat, but perhaps a more terrestrial approach is your thing. I used the Social Bicycles app (now owned by Uber, if that matters to you) to buy some time on the Long Beach bikeshare network, which is fairly extensive, with hubs throughout the city. The per-hour rental cost is $7, and I took advantage of an offer that gives a free hour with the purchase of three. The interface was temperamental, but I eventually was able to rent a bike and enjoy a ride along Junipero Beach. Salty sea air and ocean views aside, it was also a good vantage point for one of Long Beach's offshore historical oddities: the THUMS oil islands. In the 1960s, following a lift on a drilling ban, American energy companies spent $22 million on a series of artificial islands to extract oil from beneath the harbor. You wouldn't know it by looking at them: the islands look like shopping malls from shore, with extraction facilities masked by phony building facades. You can't visit them, but they're an odd and interesting footnote in the area's long history with the oil industry. Getting back to things you can visit: The Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden, on the Cal State University Long Beach campus, is a respite of tranquillity, with koi, ducks and beautiful landscaping. Admission is $5, but I was allowed in for free since I arrived close to the garden's closing time. Alamitos Park, at the end of the Alamitos Peninsula, isn't a huge green space, but has a calming energy and is a nice place to walk or bike to.

Much of Long Beach is quite walkable, and one of the most fun areas to explore, on East 4th Street near Cherry Avenue, happens to have a number of excellent vintage and thrift shops packed into just a couple of blocks. The nonprofit AIDS Assistance Thrift Store is a good place to start, with a mountain of secondhand merch for treasure-seekers, ranging from old paintings to furniture. Assistance League of Long Beach Thrift and Vintage Shop is another good one, selling $4 shirts and $12 suits; I picked up a pair of shoes for $8. A few other stores fall more into the vintage (not thrift) category: curated collections that are slightly pricier. Past and Present is an eclectic shop definitely worth popping into, with everything from old Disney merchandise to glassware and board games. Most of it isn't cheap, but there is a shelf with $10 shirts and $5 art prints. Meow is another good vintage store, specializing in accessories and apparel never previously sold or used. And La Bomba may have been my favorite, if only for the cute little dog there that snoozes among the piles of old clothes and shoes.

Over at The Hangout, another place on East 4th , I struck up a conversation with Marissa Baklayan, a stylist and photographer who was working at the shop. We chatted for a bit about The Hangout's decidedly singular concept -- succulents and ice cream -- and I asked her how she liked Long Beach. ""Everyone here knows each other, especially in this neighborhood,"" she said. Across the street at the fast casual restaurant The HipPea, where I picked up a good falafel sandwich ($7.99), one of the employees, a nice guy named Brian, echoed a similar sentiment, but added that a lack of rent control has become problematic. Rents have indeed risen sharply in Long Beach in recent years as people have realized it's a progressive and diverse community that's cheaper than many neighboring coastal cities. The resulting gentrification threatens the livelihoods of some renters, including many of the city's nonwhite and L.G.B.T. residents.

For years, Long Beach has had a reputation as one of the nation's most gay-friendly cities. The Alamitos Beach neighborhood has pride flags flying outside numerous bars and restaurants, and rainbow crosswalks are painted in intersections along East Broadway. I spent a very enjoyable karaoke night at Executive Suite, an L.G.B.T.-friendly nightclub in the Zaferia neighborhood northeast of downtown. The club takes a creative approach to incentiviz e patrons to perform, awarding $2 tokens, redeemable at the bar, per song sung for up to three songs. One of the owners, Lenny Sinatra, deftly ran the show. Also in Zaferia is Joe Jost's, a 1920s-era tavern that looks like it hasn't changed much since it opened -- which is just how the regulars like it. I struck up a conversation with Doug Pricer, a local writer and historian who explained to me the interesting history of Zaferia, which was once its own town, and its relationship to Long Beach, which was a dry city even before Prohibition. ""Zaferia used to be wet when Long Beach was dry,"" he said. When I visited, Cathleen Buck, the wife of Ken Buck, the owner (and Joe Jost's grandson ), was busy in the large back room. I ordered a Coors Light ($2.60) and a Joe's Special, a nicely spiced Polish sausage with Swiss cheese and a pickle on rye bread ($3.45) and a mountain of pretzels and spicy yellow chilies. Ms. Buck and I chatted while I noshed on a pickled egg ($1.35), another of Joe Jost's signature snacks. If you're looking for more of a meal, I'd recommend heading to Cambodia Town, centered around a roughly mile-long stretch of East Anaheim Street and home to one of the largest Cambodian populations outside of Asia. At Riverside Supermarket, just west of Cherry Avenue, you can pick up hot food as well as groceries. I bought a container of mixed-seafood sour soup for $4.99 that was sharp and tangy. You can pick up plants outside the market as well -- I bought a jasmine bush for $10 and a rice paddy herb plant, called ma om in Khmer, for just $3. Another day, I picked up an order of pad kee mao ($8.25) from Tasty Food to Go, a small restaurant specializing in Thai and Lao cuisine.

I was equally happy with the variety of different cultural activities I sampled, beginning with the Museum of Latin American Art ($10 admission), an institution dedicated to the support of Latino and Latin American art and artists. I enjoyed the exhibit ""El Exploratorio,"" which focused on the intersection of art, science and technology. A standout was Linda Vallejo's ""Datos Sagrados,"" which wove together mesmerizing pictographs with data about Latino immigration. At the Long Beach Playhouse, I took in a show -- a solidly acted performance of Lynn Nottage's ""Crumbs From the Table of Joy,"" which explores issues of adolescence, race and religion in the life of a black family in 1950s New York City ($20). Afterward, I headed to Ballast Point, an absurdly large brewpub with great views on the Alamitos Bay Marina. I picked up a Moscow Mule sour beer ($5) and got lost on one of the property's patios. Sipping on the gingery drink, I plotted my next visit: My to-do list was barely halfway done. Long Beach, it seemed, demanded -- and deserved -- more attention."
23510,"'Abnormal, as Most Geniuses Are': Celebrating 200 Years of Herman Melville","The Times has not always given the writer his due. Here's a look at how we covered him and his most famous novel, 'Moby-Dick,' over the past century or two.","When Herman Melville died in 1891, The New York Times barely noted it, listing his obituary after a civil engineer, ""the best known criminal lawyer in Connecticut"" and ""the oldest resident of the Oranges.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/books/review/01Melville01/01Melville01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=14ce035a1038e534e166a2d469737b75056a5cdf0381f0c615630d7bb9c3cbc0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/books/herman-melville-moby-dick.html,e41dea5f-9a92-55f0-b6eb-82c18f436e27.jpg,"""Moby-Dick"" was published in 1851, but The New York Times didn't review it. In fact, The Times didn't mention Herman Melville until 1861 -- in a review of somebody else's book, ""Adventures in the South Pacific."" ""The author has borrowed bodily, without giving credit therefor, from Melville's 'Moby Dick,'"" the paper complained, while conceding it was a theft the publisher, ""the Harpers, may have sanctioned, as they hold the copyright of both books."" In 1876, The Times reviewed Melville's work for the first time -- a two-volume, 600-page poem about the Holy Land, ""Clarel,"" declaring tartly: ""It should have been written in prose. ... Verse is certainly not the author's forte.""

In 1890, the paper reported that Melville had slipped so far into obscurity that most New Yorkers did not realize he was still alive. ""There are more people to-day who believe Herman Melville dead than there are those who know he is living. And yet if one chose to walk along East Eighteenth Street, New-York City, any morning about 9 o'clock, he would see the famous writer of sea stories -- stories which have never been equaled.""

When Melville died on Sept. 28, 1891, the paper barely noted it, listing him after ""one of the founders of Navesink, N.J.,"" ""a civil engineer,"" ""a special partner in the picture-importing firm of Reichard & Co.,"" ""the best known criminal lawyer in Connecticut"" and ""the oldest resident of the Oranges,"" to name a few. It also misspelled the title of his most famous book. ""Herman Melville died yesterday at his residence, 104 East Twenty-sixth Street, this city, of heart failure, aged seventy-two. He was the author of 'Typee,' ""Omoo,' 'Mobie Dick' and other seafaring tales, written in earlier years."" Several days later, in lieu of a longer, more formal obituary, The Times ran an appreciation of Melville. ""There has died and been buried in this city, during the current week, at an advanced age, a man who is so little known, even by name, to the generation now in the vigor of life that only one newspaper contained an obituary account of him, and this was but of three or four lines. Yet forty years ago the appearance of a new book by Herman Melville was esteemed a literary event.""

The paper pointed out that most of Melville's books were out of print, and added, ""When a visiting British writer a few years ago inquired at a gathering in New-York of distinctly literary Americans what had become of Herman Melville,"" no one was able to tell him anything, despite the fact that Melville ""was then living within a half mile of the place of the conversation.""

A letter to The New York Times Book Review described what it was like to be friends with Melville: ""Though a delightful talker when in the mood, he was abnormal, as most geniuses are, and had to be handled with care. He seemed to me to hold his work in small esteem, and discouraged my attempts to discuss them. 'You know,' he would say, 'more about them than I do. I have forgotten them.'""

""Moby-Dick"" has ""had to wait long for an adequate illustrated edition,"" The Times said in a 1930 review of the novel's famous Rockwell Kent edition. The paper liked Kent's drawings well enough (""the drawings which he made for this edition are among the best he has ever put between the covers of a book""), but found fault with the typography and called the book itself a ""squat, bulky volume."""

In 2013, the city and an informal group of designers, educators, museum representatives, showroom and brand representatives and others jointly introduced NYCxDesign to raise the profile of New York's design week and encourage collaboration among different groups and across design disciplines.

The group eventually became NYCxDesign's steering committee. NYCxDesign runs from early to mid-May, and functions as an umbrella organization and information clearinghouse for hundreds of design-related events that run in tandem with several independently operated design trade fairs. According to the economic development corporation, the event drew more than 336,000 people in 2018.

""It needed to move outside of city operations to grow and build new audiences,"" said Alex Costas, the senior vice president of marketing for N.Y.C.E.D.C. ""Sandow has a large global audience, a proven track record with producing events and relationships with leading design firms around the world,"" he added."

On this historic day, the House of Representatives opens its proceedings for the first time to televised coverage. I wish to congratulate you for your courage in making this possible. And the committee who has worked so hard under the leadership of Congressman Charles Rose to make this a reality. Television will change this institution, Mr. Speaker, just as it has changed the executive branch. But the good will far outweigh the bad. From this day forward, every member of this body must ask himself or herself: How many Americans are listening to the debates which are made? When the House becomes comfortable with the changes brought by television coverage, the news media will be allowed to bring their own cameras into this chamber. In the meantime, there is no censorship. Every word is available for broadcast coverage, and journalists will be able to use and edit as they see fit. The solution for the lack of confidence in government, Mr. Speaker, is more open government at all levels. I hope, for example, that the leadership of the United States Senate will see this as a friendly challenge to begin to open their proceedings. ""Under the rules, the gentleman's time has expired."" The marriage of this medium and our open debate has the potential, Mr. Speaker, to revitalize representative democracy.



Forty years ago, C-Span went live with its first public broadcast from the House of Representatives chamber, giving Americans a television-shaped window into how lawmakers behave in the ornate room where history is often made. Ushering in the C-Span era on March 19, 1979, was Al Gore, then a representative from Tennessee, who had pushed for the network's access to the Capitol. ""From this day forward,"" Mr. Gore said at the time, ""every member of this body must ask himself or herself, how many Americans are listening to the debates which are made?""

This interview with Ms. Swain, who joined C-Span three years after it started, has been edited for brevity and clarity. In the moment that Al Gore approached the lectern in the House chamber and C-Span went live, what changed in American politics? The fact that people could actually see their elected representatives in their living room -- and now on their phones -- was a fundamental change. In the past, people might pull the lever every two years for their member of Congress and, if they were super engaged, might read a newsletter that came in the mail or go to an occasional town hall meeting. This meant that any time you were interested, you could watch what your member of Congress had to say. Prior to television in Congress, the only time that members really got attention is if they had big names like Kennedy or if they did something outrageous, either positively or negatively, or if they were a member of the leadership.

Initially, there was a lot of resistance in Washington to the idea of C-Span broadcasting House floor debates. And the Senate didn't allow C-Span in for another seven years. Why was there such resistance? Members had concerns that the cameras would be swinging around and taking pictures of members while they were not focused attentively on the debates or -- heaven forbid -- closing their eyes for a second. Or today, perhaps they might be sending out a tweet. One of the ways this finally came to bear was that they created a compromise that members could live with. The compromise was that the House of Representatives, the speaker's office, would control the cameras that were on the floor of the House. All the rest of Congress, press conferences and hearings, it's C-Span or other news organizations covering them independently. Every time there's a change of speaker we have sent a letter saying: 'Now's the time. Allow C-Span or other journalistic organizations to put our own cameras in side by side.' That argument continues to go nowhere.

Were politicians self-conscious about how they'd appear on camera? I think more so there was the concern that they wouldn't be in control of the picture. The Senate finally acquiesced and it's a classic story of American politics. The House was coming into people's living rooms via C-Span and then regularly on the nightly news because what we did could be picked up regularly for nightly stories about the House. Television loves pictures, so they would do more stories about the House. The Senate was becoming concerned that it was becoming the second-tier citizen of Congress.

The person who was really most instrumental is Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who had been one of the old-line members who was very much an institutionalist and very much concerned about how the Senate would change. He went home to West Virginia to speak and was introduced in West Virginia, his home state, as the speaker of the House. And it's because he had a big shock of white hair, as did the then-Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill. And this brought it all home to him. So he convinced some of the recalcitrant members, they did a vote and C-Span went on in June of 1986. What is one of your most significant memories from your time at C-Span? The day that the Challenger shuttle exploded we were televising it live, and I believe I was on the air as the shuttle was going up. And it became very clear as you watched that picture of the shuttle that this was a major catastrophe. We sat and watched as long as NASA took pictures, and then the story began to unfold. Then we opened up our phone lines. There was just an incredible outpouring from around the country of people witnessing this absolute tragedy, human tragedy and also technological tragedy unfold in front of their eyes. C-Span has given politicians a platform to connect directly with their constituents, but now they can do that on social media. Is C-Span still relevant? C-Span's relevance comes in the form of not only all of the events that we cover every day but within minutes after we televise them, they are digitized and stored on our video archives. It has 250,000 hours of political video that we've covered since 1987. That means a member of Congress can pull a clip from their hearing and send it out to constituents. It also means that people on social media or late-night comedians have immediate access to this. I think most people who are in their 20s or younger, if they have an experience with C-Span it is through social media, it is through the late-night comedians. The creation of our video library in 1987 was every bit as significant as the original creation of C-Span.

C-Span has long fought for cameras to be allowed in the Supreme Court chamber. What are the chances that you'll succeed? I feel a little bit like it's Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill. What we have documented over the years is that when people are nominated to the Supreme Court they go into their committee hearings expressing their open mind to the concept, and then once they get inside that chamber of nine, they manage to be convinced by the others there that it would be detrimental to the institution. We keep hoping that as the generations change and younger appointees come in who are very familiar with media and even social media, that the attitude will change. But the institution continues to prevail."

Fun as they are, these activities can tamper with our circadian rhythms, the feedback loops that sync our body's functions to our external environment.

The liver, which helps regulate your body's metabolism, gets thrown off by unhealthy patterns of sleep or by changes in diet or alcohol consumption. If you're experiencing indigestion or your energy levels are low after too many holiday parties, your liver could be out of sync. In recent years, more and more research in the field of chronobiology, the science of biological rhythms, suggests the importance of maintaining a consistent schedule for the sake of your liver, which has a clock of its own.

Circadian rhythms are important for helping the liver anticipate the body's demands throughout the day, like stockpiling energy after meals and releasing it when we sleep, said Felix Naef, a professor of quantitative biology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.

Recent studies have examined how alcohol affects circadian rhythms. This year, researchers reported that night shift workers given two to four glasses of wine each day for a week had altered circadian rhythms and ""leakier"" intestinal linings than day workers, which could put them at risk of alcoholic liver disease."

Their signifiers -- the shoulder pads, red ties, gold chains and buttons -- have been weirdly present again, in fashion, pop culture and politics alike, ever since that avatar from the decade, Donald J. Trump, started taking up all the air in the room.

So it is little wonder, really, that when Virginie Viard, Chanel's current creative director, decided to have her Metiers d'Art show in the Chateau de Chenonceau, the Loire Valley castle that was once home to Catherine de Medici, the renaissance patron, both periods got spliced together in her mind. Not to mention the always present history of Gabrielle Chanel herself.

That's how it goes in fashion: The designer imagination leaps from one connection to another, pulling pennies out of the air, and then adds them up into an unexpectedly alluring new whole. That's how it works."
2717,The Curious Case of the Strangely Similar Movie Titles,"""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" is not ""Sometimes Always Never."" But the teams behind these indies didn't consider changing names. Why not?",The posters reflect how different the films are — except for their titles.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/08/arts/08film-titles/08film-titles-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=739c8b8859c91a66260164091b3ceaffc2b7f08e7bfbfd29ed4862e750fecd75&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/movies/dueling-movie-titles.html,9745802b-430f-58ab-9970-303fda0fd8ca.jpg,"The posters reflect how different the films are -- except for their titles.





Despite what your brain may tell you, ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" is not the same movie as ""Sometimes Always Never."" The former (in theaters March 13) is a neo-realistic drama that examines the hurdles a 17-year-old Pennsylvania girl faces to get an abortion in New York City. The latter (in theaters April 17) is a whimsical British dramedy starring a Scrabble-obsessed Bill Nighy on a hunt for his estranged son. Both are small, indie films. Both have spring release dates. And both are eager to find a distinct audience, despite sharing overlapping titles of the same rearranged words. Yet neither considered changing the title to avoid confusion. Why not? The director and writer Eliza Hittman originally called ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" simply ""A"" when she began working on the script in 2012. ""'A' as in abortion movie, as in 'The Scarlet Letter,'"" she said. ""I didn't think it was a title that would resonate with audiences ultimately, and I knew I was searching for something more dynamic.""

""There is something about the repetition of it that really struck me, the rhythm and repetition,"" she said. ""And obviously, the intimacy of the conversation. I knew in the narrative that we were building to an intimate revelation."" ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" premiered in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won a special jury award, and Hittman said there was never any pushback on her title choice along the way. ""Obviously, when I was thinking about using it as the title, I did an IMDb search to see if there were any films that shared the same title and nothing came up,"" she said, referring to the internet movie database site. She recalled that executives from Focus Features, which is distributing her film, mentioned ""Sometimes Always Never"" in an early meeting ""but I don't think anyone felt it would create confusion. It seemed like their film had been made a while ago, so I was a little surprised"" to see that it was being released around the same time. Across the Atlantic, ""Sometimes Always Never"" quietly debuted at the 2018 London Film Festival and in several international markets. Its title likewise changed from inception to release.

It was originally called ""Triple Word Score,"" like the Frank Cottrell Boyce book it is based on. But legal discussions with Hasbro over the rights to the Scrabble phrase made that a less than ideal choice. And while shooting in 2017, the director Carl Hunter felt instantly moved when Nighy spoke the line, ""Sometimes, always, never,"" to his on-screen grandson as he taught him the buttoning rule for a three-button suit (top: sometimes, middle: always, bottom: never). ""The title was in the script all the time. We just didn't spot it,"" Hunter said. ""Sometimes you read words and they're great, but then when those words are in the mouth of an artist, all of a sudden they occupy a very different world.""

When he heard Nighy deliver the line, ""a shiver went down my spine,"" he said, adding, ""I thought, 'That should be the title. It's philosophical. It's poignant. And it's poetic.'"" Hunter's background as an art director also led him to visualize the phrase on a potential poster. ""I look at words very carefully from the point of view of typography,"" he said. ""To me, I can see those three words, and they occupy a wonderful space."" Not everyone was on board. ""We had lots of long, hard discussions over whether to change the title,"" the producer Roy Boulter said. ""There was concern from the marketing department that it wasn't an easy name to hang onto -- 'Triple Word Score' is much easier to remember than 'Sometimes Always Never.' But then you'd get people going into the cinema thinking they're going to get a Scrabble drama, and that's not what it's really about. It just came to the point that it would cause us a lot less hassle with Hasbro.""

While ""Sometimes Always Never"" was originally slated for an October 2019 U.S. release, the American distributor, Blue Fox Entertainment, pushed it to March and eventually April to try to find a noncompetitive window. ""We are a small English indie and so we've got to give ourselves a big chance,"" Boulter said. ""You only get one go at release."" Jessica Tabin, a vice president at the Creative Impact marketing agency, said the two movies' convoluted titles were detrimental -- both on their own and in light of their now month-apart release dates. ""Honestly, it's not like anybody wins, and I'm surprised no one made the change,"" said Tabin, whose agency has worked on promotional campaigns for ""Parasite,"" ""The Report"" and other films. ""I really feel like a short concise title always helps. Obviously, not every movie is 'Lincoln' or 'Goodfellas,' so sometimes you have to do a little bit of explaining in your title. But that's what taglines are for."" Tabin also noted that it's not just about what title works when spoken or seen on a poster, but also what makes the most sense when marketing to moviegoers who increasingly find out about films on their phones. ""A really lengthy title isn't going to play very well on your really small screen if you're looking through film titles, or for search purposes when you're looking for movie tickets,"" she said. ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" and ""Sometimes Always Never"" aren't the only 2020 releases with titles that have wound up playing outsize roles in marketing and reception.

In February, after the Margot Robbie comic-book movie ""Birds of Prey"" fell $12 million short of expectations on its domestic opening weekend, Warner Bros. announced a ""display change"" for the title at theaters and ticketing sites, where it's now ""Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey."" While the film was technically always titled ""Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"" Tabin noted that ""nobody remembers the parenthetical portions of titles"" and many probably didn't connect the dots that ""Birds of Prey"" was ""the Harley Quinn film."" Meanwhile, the title of Autumn de Wilde's adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" was styled with a period, much to the chagrin of grammar-conscious copy editors. ""There's a period at the end of 'Emma' because it's a period film,"" de Wilde told Radio Times in Britain. (The New York Times opted against using the punctuation for clarity's sake.) ""A lot of times misplaced punctuation or all lowercase or all caps might stop you in a good way because you're not used to seeing it,"" Tabin said. ""It's there for a reason, and it's causing you to potentially want to look into it further. And maybe with 'Never Rarely Sometimes Always,' the thought process is it's so confusing that it catches your eye."" Ultimately, it's difficult to gauge how much of a role a movie's title plays in its box office success or failure, and perhaps the parallel appellations of ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" and ""Sometimes Always Never"" will even work in their favor. ""Whether it worries me or not, I'm not quite sure,"" the ""Sometimes Always Never"" director Hunter said. ""In a strange way, because of Eliza's film having a similar title, the phone has been ringing and people want to talk. So maybe, actually, it's a very good thing."""

Take their beloved Auburn University football team: On Dec. 1, the Tigers had won five in a row and were ranked No. 2 in the College Football Playoff rankings. But a month later, Ms. Long and Mr. Scott watched its two fiercest rivals, Georgia and Alabama, advance to the national championship game, while Auburn finished its season by losing in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl to unbeaten University of Central Florida. Ms. Long and Mr. Scott know something about the longevity of streaks. Both spent more than 50 years in the glow of what they describe as near-perfect marriages, then were brought low by the deaths of their spouses. But love, as Ms. Long, 83, and Mr. Scott, 80, learned late in life, has a way of winning. ""This was not supposed to happen,"" said Mr. Scott of his relationship with Ms. Long, which turned romantic in 2015 after decades of friendship. ""I never intended it to happen, and Judy never intended it to happen. But together we have 105 years' worth of experience being married. So we like to tell people we're pretty sure we know what we're doing.""

The Longs, a few years older than the Scotts, had married young, too: The former football captain and sorority girl, both 1955 graduates, married a semester before Ms. Long graduated, when she was 20, he 22. The Scotts followed the Longs' lead when they moved to Birmingham, laying down roots in their new community by joining the local church. McElwain Baptist, where Ms. Long and Mr. Scott still go for Sunday services, was feeling the full blush of the baby boom in those years. The Longs had three daughters in four years, with the oldest, Penny, born in 1956. The Scotts had the first of their three children, Mike, a year later, in 1957. Both young families grew up side by side in what felt, in those days, like a small Southern town.

On at least a few occasions, the children were allowed to join. ""It was sort of like a supper club, and all the adults would get sitters,"" said Sharon Jones, Mr. Scott's daughter, who graduated from Auburn in 1982 with a degree in animal sciences. ""But there was one time I went to the Longs on a Friday night, and they had this huge gerbil habitat. I was always an animal lover, so I remember that."" Penny Long Marler, Ms. Long's daughter, recalls the Scotts house in the 1960s as a place she could reinforce her eldest-child status. ""We used to go over there and play in the street, and I would try to boss everyone around,"" she said.

Ms. Long remembers joining a bowling league with Carol Scott around that time. Mr. Scott, who is still only semiretired after switching careers from engineering to home building decades ago, remembers playing regular card games with Jim Long. In addition to church and the children, there was always Auburn football to talk about. Ms. Long has had season tickets for as long as she can remember, considering it almost a duty. Before her husband was team captain, her father-in-law, Howell Long, was captain in 1929. Mr. Scott, who played football in high school but was cut when he tried out at Auburn, didn't let that rejection sour his enthusiasm for the Tigers. He too has made his way to the stadium for almost every home game since his student days. As the Long and Scott children got older, hopes about carrying the college legacy took hold in both families. By the mid-1970s, Ms. Long Marler was the first of a new generation to enroll at Auburn. By 1985, all three of the Long girls, as well as the Scott's three children -- two boys, Mike and Greg, along with Ms. Jones -- had graduated from Auburn. (The legacy didn't end there. Of Mr. Scott's eight grandchildren, seven are Auburn graduates. One granddaughter is currently attending the University of Alabama at Huntsville on a volleyball scholarship. And there are no hard feelings about that. ""We all understood,"" Mr. Scott said.)

The Longs and Scotts stayed in touch throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as their nests emptied. When Jim Long died suddenly of a heart condition in 2006, Mr. Scott was the first person Ms. Long Marler remembers seeing at her parents' house after she had rushed to Birmingham from her home in Pensacola, Fla. ""Jim came over that morning around 7:30 to see how he could help,"" she said. When Carol Scott died, in 2013, of pancreatic cancer, Ms. Long was just as sympathetic. But by then she had gotten used to widowhood. She spent her days volunteering at a hospital and had joined a local social group known as the POWs, for ""poor old widows."" She felt fulfilled, and not especially lonely. Things were slightly different for Mr. Scott, who lost the love of his life and his card-game partner when Carol died. Friends encouraged him to find a new partner for the Friday-night cards session he had regularly attended with her. Eventually, about a year after Carol's death, he asked his old friend Ms. Long. ""I knew all the other people there, and we were friends and we both enjoyed it,"" Ms. Long said. By the end of 2014, she was going regularly with him. It was during one of their weekly games that they discovered during conversation that each had a love of dancing.

""We were just having so much fun together, and we had so much in common,"" Mr. Scott said. ""We were just dating. We never expected it to become a serious thing,"" Ms. Long said. In 2016, Mr. Scott told his children of the romance. Ms. Long held off. ""With all the good years we'd both had, we didn't want to do anything that wouldn't let those good times continue,"" she said. ""So I hesitated."" But in June of that year, with much of their social circle in Birmingham sensing the love in the air, Ms. Long treated her daughters to a trip down the Danube River with the express purpose of sharing the news. ""We were on a layover in Amsterdam when she said, 'I have something to tell you,'"" Ms. Long Marler said. ""We thought she was going to tell us she had cancer. Instead she said, 'Well, Jim Scott and I have been dating.'"" The three sisters had the same reaction, she said. ""We were all like, 'This is great! We love Jim.' We were truly happy for her.""

On Jan. 6, before 40 family members, more than half of them Auburn graduates, Ms. Long and Mr. Scott walked down the aisle of McElwain Baptist, a church rich with memories for both. All six of their children were married in the same sanctuary. Funerals for both their first spouses were held there, too. Ms. Long wore a floor-length silver gown with a sparkling beaded bodice and a single strand of pearls. Mr. Scott wore a black suit with a white rose boutonniere. The six children from their first unions, now in their 50s and 60s, stood by their parents as Ms. Long's son-in-law, the minister the Rev. David Zimmerman, a Baptist minister married to her youngest daughter, Becky, officiated. The bride and groom, holding hands, fought tears throughout the traditional Baptist ceremony. Just before they were wed, Ms. Long Marler read a blessing she had written. ""Who would expect, late in their lives, that old friends would become close, fall in love, and decide to marry?"" she said. ""To love long is unusual these days and to love long and find love again, even more."" Mr. Scott suspects the odds are good he'll find success in his second marriage. ""My daughter told me that people who have had happy marriages are more likely to have happy marriages if they marry again,"" he said. ""I believe that's true."""

Sprightly directed by Jose Zayas, ""Privilege"" takes place in the upscale living room of a couple simply named A and B (Laura Gomez and Ana Grosse), who discuss the topics of the moment with their friends C and D (Dalia Davi and Satomi Blair).

Are opinions as worthy as reporting? Are people as desperate for money as they say? They wonder. Then A brings up a quandary straight out of ""The Twilight Zone"": What if you could push a button and get all the money you wanted, but someone, somewhere, dies? Existential questions, and wine, keep flowing as the four women debate the options.

Series B of the marathon -- jointly presented by the theater and Radio Drama Network -- continues as the lights go down and the space is transformed into the corporate-office setting of Carole Real's ""The Guard Will Escort You to Ruff-Ruff."" (Frank J. Oliva handled the efficient set design for all the pieces.)"
40770,A Scholarly Sting Operation Shines a Light on 'Predatory' Journals,"A group of researchers created a ruse to draw attention to the seamy side of open-access journals, some of which will publish just about anything for a fee.",The résumé of the fictional Anna O. Szust.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/23/science/23JOURNALS/23JOURNALS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=1c24d454f30992ea740a49530dc28d4731824a6f4c794509a5cd660743496bc4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/open-access-journals.html,79364fab-bf76-5dfc-9a27-23a94e4e459a.jpg,"The applicant's nom de plume was not exactly subtle, if you know Polish. The middle initial and surname of the author, Anna O. Szust, mean ""fraudster."" Her publications were fake and her degrees were fake. The book chapters she listed among her publications could not be found, but perhaps that should not have been a surprise because the book publishers were fake, too. Yet, when Dr. Fraud applied to 360 randomly selected open-access academic journals asking to be an editor, 48 accepted her and four made her editor in chief. She got two offers to start a new journal and be its editor. One journal sent her an email saying, ""It's our pleasure to add your name as our editor in chief for the journal with no responsibilities."" Little did they know that they had fallen for a sting, plotted and carried out by a group of researchers who wanted to draw attention to and systematically document the seamy side of open-access publishing. While those types of journals began with earnest aspirations to make scientific papers available to everyone, their proliferation has had unintended consequences. Traditional journals typically are supported by subscribers who pay a fee while authors pay nothing to be published. Nonsubscribers can only read papers if they pay the journal for each one they want to see.

Open-access journals reverse that model. The authors pay and the published papers are free to anyone who cares to read them. Publishing in an open-access journal can be expensive -- the highly regarded Public Library of Science (PLOS) journals charge from $1,495 to $2,900 to publish a paper, with the fee dependent on which of its journals accepts the paper. Not everyone anticipated what would happen next, or to what extent it would happen. The open-access business model spawned a shadowy world of what have been called predatory journals. They may have similar names to legitimate journals, but exist by publishing just about anything sent to them for a fee that can range from under $100 to thousands of dollars. The fee often is between $100 and $400, said Jeffrey Beall, scholarly communications librarian at the University of Colorado, Denver, as the journals compete for paying customers. Of course, it is easier for predatory journals to have low fees because their expenses are minimal. The researchers decided not to list any of the fake journals that they uncovered in the sting, saying that some have names so close to those of legitimate journals that it would be confusing.

There are now thousands of fake open-access journals, about as many as legitimate ones, according to one of the creators of Dr. Fraud, Katarzyna Pisanski, a researcher in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex in England, and her colleagues. It was that alternate world that Dr. Fraud tapped into. The legitimate journals rejected her application out of hand, but many fake ones did not hesitate to take her on. The investigators, writing about their sting operation in Nature, said they had seen young colleagues fall for the blandishments of predatory journals, not realizing that the emails they received were from publications that only wanted their money. Dr. Pisanski and her colleagues wanted to help researchers understand how fake journals operated. ""The emails can be very flattering,"" Dr. Pisanski said, telling the recipients they are ""eminent researchers"" and ""inviting"" them to contribute. When researchers respond and send in papers, ""they are published at lightning speed, often without peer review,"" she said. But not everyone who publishes in these journals is an innocent dupe. Mr. Beall, who until recently published a list of predatory journals, said he believes many researchers know exactly what they are doing when they publish there. ""I believe there are countless researchers and academics, currently employed, who have secured jobs, promotions, and tenure using publications in pay-to-publish journals as part of their credentials and experience for the jobs and promotions they got,"" Mr. Beall said. And it can require real diligence on the part of employers to ferret out those questionable publications, Mr. Beall said."
6588,"Travels With John Conway, in 258 Septillion Dimensions","The Princeton mathemagician, who died in April, left an engaging legacy of numerical gamesmanship.","Dr. Conway in 2012, playing Dots and Boxes at Princeton.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/19/science/18SCI-CONWAY1/18SCI-CONWAY1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=5c5f92a453658a4f7a606b679d38bfe9ea918fa9895c0c1c6d7c04b073fecc0a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/science/john-conway-math.html,74445da5-70e2-5f6e-a7a9-885f77ded451.jpg,"When John Horton Conway, the Princeton ""mathemagician"" who died in April at age 82, first found fame in the late 1960s and early '70s, he joined the academic equivalent of the jet set. Then at the University of Cambridge, he would fly to Montreal or New York, deliver a lecture on his Conway group -- an entity in the realm of mathematical symmetry that inhabits 24 dimensions -- and return home all within the space of a day. Occasionally, he made a detour to visit Martin Gardner, the mathematical games columnist for Scientific American, at his house in Hastings-on-Hudson, just north of New York. Mr. Gardner taught him magic tricks: Try tying a knot while holding onto both ends of the string, without ever letting go. Dr. Conway, in turn, regaled Mr. Gardner with puzzles and games -- Sprouts, for instance, a pencil-and-paper game he had invented with Michael Paterson, a grad student, and which quickly charmed the entire math department, administrative staff included.

Writing Dr. Conway's biography, I spent many mind-bending hours trying to keep up. His office at Princeton University was a perpetual mess, so he had relocated to a hallway adjacent to the math department common room. The corridor was lined with window alcoves, each furnished with two armchairs and a chalkboard. In Dr. Conway's alcove, loose-leaf works in progress were filed beneath a seat cushion. From there, he delivered a master class, to a parade of visitors, on how to spend all of one's time -- as he would boast -- doing nothing, being lazy and playing games. His syllabus might include a riff on the science of rainbows (primary, secondary, tertiary), or ""chemical p"" (memorizing pi using a mnemonic based on the periodic table of elements), or his Doomsday rule for speedily calculating the day of the week for any given date. Sometimes we ventured out. Once, we took the train to Poughkeepsie to meet George Odom, an accomplished amateur geometer and an inpatient at the Hudson River Psychiatric Center. Mr. Odom had made a few discoveries pertaining to the golden ratio -- a ratio describing aesthetically pleasing proportions of certain shapes, usually rectangular. Mr. Odom's discoveries intrigued Dr. Conway because they related the golden ratio specifically to the cube. ""I've always felt the primacy of the cube,"" Mr. Odom told him. Dr. Conway was partial to the triangle, for which he discovered the Conway circle theorem: If you extend the sides of any triangle beyond each vertex, at a distance equal to the length of the opposite side, the resulting six points lie on a circle. (A ""proof without words"" was recently featured in ""The Big Lock-Down Math-Off."")

In September 2009, with his son Gareth, then 8, we traveled to Liverpool, England, Dr. Conway's hometown, and Cambridge, his alma mater, to clear up some counterfactuals. (He was a notoriously unreliable narrator of his own life.) During our visit with his daughters from his first marriage -- Annie, Ellie, Rosie and Susie -- we played his One Bit Word Game: Try conversing using words containing only one syllable or ""bit."" (When an opponent slips up, shout ""Bang!"") Dr. Conway once challenged himself to deliver a number theory class in one-bit words, no small feat given the word ""number"" itself: ""Those things you count with -- you know, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more...."" Cambridge was peak Conway, especially with regard to games. With his collaborators, Elwyn Berlekamp and Richard Guy (who died in March at 103), he purportedly invented or reinvented 10 games a day, assisted by a regular rotation of students: Simon Norton devised the game Tribulations; Mike Guy countered with Fibulations. (Both are Nim-like games based on triangle numbers and Fibonacci numbers.) The group amassed folders of ""games without names"" and ""names without games."" In 1981, after 15 years, they published the multivolume, best-selling book ""Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays.""

Chapter 22 contained Phutball, short for Philosopher's Football, a two-player board game with stones, driven by negative feedback. ""Every move is bad,"" Dr. Conway warned. Chapter 25 covered Dr. Conway's Game of Life, prefaced by Oscar Wilde's advice that ""Life is too important to be taken seriously."" First published in Mr. Gardner's October 1970 column, the Game of Life is a ""no-player, never-ending"" game, as Dr. Conway liked to say, and it is considered one of the earliest, most remarkable and most popular examples of a cellular automaton -- according to only a few simple rules, cells on the screen evolve from iteration to iteration to produce an astoundingly complex bestiary of ""Life-forms."" ""LIFE IS UNIVERSAL,"" Dr. Conway wrote to Mr. Gardner in December 1970, in all caps. That is, the Game of Life could be programmed to do any calculation; it was a metaphor for, and contained, all of mathematics. ""The Game of Life has contributed to the public perception of mathematics in a way that few mathematical discoveries in modern history have,"" said Manjul Bhargava, a mathematician and a colleague of Dr. Conway's at Princeton. All of this gaming could be classified as serious research, of course; as both player and spectator, Dr. Conway was analyzing games, observing strategy and classifying the moves available to each player. He noticed that games behaved like numbers, and numbers like games. This led to his theory of surreal numbers -- a huge new number system containing not only all the real numbers, but also a boggling collection of infinites and infinitesimals, like p minus 1 divided by the cube root of infinity.

To explain his theory, Dr. Conway wrote a book, ""On Numbers and Games,"" and two papers, ""All Games Bright and Beautiful"" and ""All Numbers Great and Small."" He told me, ""You know the hymn: 'All things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small.' But in the case of this theory, it's all games bright and beautiful that come first. The games are logically prior to the numbers."" He viewed this discovery as so fundamental that he named it simply ""No,"" in bold, meaning all numbers, capital N. Donald Knuth, the Stanford computer scientist and author of ""The Art of Computer Programming,"" came up with the more enduring name while writing the novelette ""Surreal Numbers: How Two Ex-Students Turned On to Pure Mathematics and Found Total Happiness.""

On hearing of his friend's death, Dr. Knuth said that Dr. Conway was his second favorite mathematician, outshone only by the 18th-century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. ""John gave pleasure to connoisseurs who appreciate deep thinking. That's real beauty, for me, and touches off deep emotions."" He noted that Dr. Conway has been mentioned more than 25 times so far in ""The Art of Computer Programming,"" for different contributions: ""I expect the citings to continue long after his death (as happened to Elvis)."" How to beat children at their own games In March of 2010, we set out for ""G4G9,"" the ninth biennial gathering honoring Mr. Gardner, in Atlanta. Over five days, 10-minute presentations followed one after another. Dr. Conway offered an ""Untitled Talk,"" in which he lectured (during a special 25-minute session) on ""The Lexicode Theorem -- Or Is It?"" ""I'll cast some doubt on this theorem, to say the very least, but all turns out well in the end,"" he told the audience, and proceeded to convert his work with sphere-packing into game theory (drawing from a paper written with Neil Sloane, ""Lexicographic Codes: Error-Correcting Codes from Game Theory""). ""Conway is the rare sort of mathematician whose ability to connect his pet mathematical interests makes one wonder if he isn't, at some level, shaping mathematical reality and not just exploring it,"" James Propp, a mathematician at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, said afterward. Sphere-packing and games are two separate realms that Dr. Conway had investigated on different paths, with no obvious intersection, said Dr. Propp. ""But somehow, through the force of his personality and the intensity of his passion, he bent the mathematical universe to his will."" Our mathematical journey continued that August at Canada/USA Mathcamp, an international summer program for high-school students keen on math, which was being held that year at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass. Dr. Conway was a perennial star attraction; I first met him at Mathcamp in 2003 -- he was doing his signature trick, spinning a wire hanger above his head with a penny balanced on the hook -- and every summer he bestowed and inflicted his usual bewildering repertoire. He displayed a special fanaticism for Dots and Boxes, a 19th-century pencil-and-paper game.

Our last trip together was in January of 2019. We headed out from Dr. Conway's Princeton care residence -- he lived there after suffering a number of strokes -- to a favorite restaurant, Tomo Sushi, with mathematicians Joseph Kohn and Simon Kochen and the New York magician Mark Mitton. (Dick Esterle, the inventor of geometric toys like the ""Icosa"" fidget ball, joined by text.) While waiting for lunch, Dr. Conway recalled a visit with Mr. Gardner. During dinner at a restaurant, the waitress had dealt plates onto the table with a clatter. Mr. Gardner responded with a sleight-of-hand gag: He dropped his cutlery straight through his plate. The waitress screamed, and then Mr. Gardner repeated the trick around the table. Sitting there at the sushi joint, Mr. Mitton grabbed a plate and knife and improvised an encore on the spot. Dr. Conway was appreciatively agog; 50 years earlier, he had asked Mr. Gardner to teach him that trick. ""Later,"" Mr. Gardner promised. But ""later"" proved elusive.

60912,A Struggle to Educate the Severely Disabled,School districts try to balance instruction in functional skills and academics with providing custodial care.,"Donovan Forde, left, is visited by his mother, Michelle Forde, and half-brother, Zion, at a nursing facility in New York.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/06/20/nyregion/20donovan-span/20donovan-span-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2010&h=354&w=600&s=9247fd70579188be254280d3de130d6b20161ad755d0b62b7a5e350af84e9944&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/education/20donovan.html,72ead9cc-6095-5092-bc4f-6f4f43baa98b.jpg,"Donovan Forde was dozing when the teacher came around to his end of the table. Pale winter light filtered in through the grated classroom window, and the warm room filled softly with jazz. It fell to his teacher's aide to wake him up from his mid-morning nap. She shined a small flashlight back and forth in his eyes like a dockworker signaling a ship, and called his name. Then she put her hand on his cheek, steering his head forward as he focused his eyes. The teacher, Ricardo Torres, placed a red apple against Donovan's closed left hand, and then held it near his nose so he could smell it. ""Donovan, the fruit holds the seeds of the plant,"" he said. Then Mr. Torres held a plastic container of apple seeds to Donovan's ear, shaking it, and placed Donovan's hand inside so he could feel them. ""And these are the seeds,"" Mr. Torres said.

He watched Donovan's eyes and face for a sign he had understood, a smile, nod, a noise. Donovan gently pulled his hand away. No one knew if he had grasped it. At a time when his peers are enrolled in college or earning money at jobs, Donovan, a handsome 20-year-old with a sliver of a mustache, is still in public school, being taught the most basic of facts. His vocabulary for this science unit, which lasted about two weeks, was three words: seeds, fruit and juice. And yet, because of his cognitive disabilities brought on by a traumatic brain injury at nearly 6 months old, it is almost impossible to know what he comprehends and retains. After 15 years in the New York City school system, he is less reserved and more social, but otherwise has shown almost no progress, his mother said. Once predominantly isolated in institutions, severely disabled students have been guaranteed a free, appropriate public education like all children since the passage of federal legislation in 1975. In the years since, school districts across the country have struggled to find a balance between instruction in functional skills and academics while providing basic custodial care. Donovan is part of a fraction of a fraction, classified as having ""multiple disabilities,"" a broad category under the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act that refers to children who have at least two disabilities and severe educational needs.

There are 132,000 such students in the United States, out of more than 6.5 million now receiving some kind of special education service at an estimated cost of $74 billion a year. Students with multiple disabilities, like Donovan and his schoolmates, can have a wide range of diagnoses, including cerebral palsy, rare genetic disorders and problems that stem from conditions in utero or at birth, some of which have no name. For many of these students, the post-school future holds day residential programs, nursing facilities or group homes, not college or jobs. The concepts of educational reform and standardized assessment have little meaning for them; they are among the most costly to educate and the least understood. Donovan recognizes familiar voices, and can mimic their intonations. He communicates some needs; at lunch, he pulls off his bib to show when he is finished. When happy, he sings fragmented notes, his scratchy voice rising in triplets and quads. But he cannot walk, does not speak and cannot feed himself or see much beyond shapes and shadows. On standardized assessments, he has trouble with tasks most children master in infancy, like opening and closing his eyes on command. Occupied much of the time by his own inner world, he does not respond consistently to his own name. One year before he is to leave the school system, educating Donovan remains a search for ways to reach him. Donovan's mother, Michelle Forde, likes his special education high school, Public School 79, the Horan School, in East Harlem, where she feels he is welcome and cared for. But she wishes his teachers would spend more time working on his practical challenges, like his self-abusive habit of hitting himself in the face so hard that he has to wear thick white cotton mitts most of the time, even when he sleeps.

Instead of having him work on basic academic goals, like identifying shapes and coins, she wishes he had physical therapy more than 30 minutes, twice a week, because it is generally the only time during the day he is taken out of his wheelchair, except when an aide takes him to the bathroom to change him. Rebecca Bravo, the principal of P.S. 79 and the mother of a 38-year-old severely disabled daughter, says that those things are important, but she also has broader aims. For example, Donovan will never be able to prepare breakfast, but he should be allowed to help stir a pot in cooking class, even if an aide must move his hand. He might not be able to call 911, but if he learns about firefighters in social studies, he might be able to recognize a siren when he hears one. Ms. Bravo does not want to go back to the days when students like Donovan were given only art and music instruction, along with a narrow focus on practical skills. ""For too long, that's where we kept them, in art and music, and we didn't give them some of the other things they needed,"" she said. P.S. 79, following city and state mandates, has been moving toward more academic instruction for years. This year, her last before retirement, Ms. Bravo decided to add a twist. Not only would she teach her severely disabled students adapted versions of science, social studies, English and math, but they would also switch classes almost every 50 minutes instead of remaining with the same teacher. The different environments would be stimulating, she reasoned, and give them a high school experience more like that of their general education peers. The day starts at 8 a.m. The first hour is spent in the cafeteria, eating breakfast and waiting for children to arrive on dozens of buses from throughout the city.

Painted with colorful murals, the hallways bustle with activity. Upstairs are special classes for students with emotional disturbance, autism or learning disabilities. Some 170 adults -- aides, therapists, teachers and administrators -- work with 319 students. In 2009, the cost per student was $58,877, more than triple the citywide average of $17,696. It is a Tuesday in late February, and Donovan's first class is adaptive physical education. A line of teacher's aides wheels and walks the students to a classroom that has primary-colored mats along one wall, as well as a few balls, cones and a floor-based basketball net. ""We are in GYM,"" the teacher, Kenneth Toron, announces in a circus performer voice, slurring his words somewhat because his left side is partially paralyzed from a stroke. As a visual clue, he holds up a simple line drawing of a basketball and a net known as a Mayer-Johnson symbol. ""We are going to EXERCISE."" Mr. Toron sets up a few cones on the floor and starts up a music playlist on the classroom computer. ""Surfin' U.S.A."" by the Beach Boys is first up. The more advanced students begin walking, some hesitantly, others easily, around the cones. Some students in Donovan's classes are able to speak, master vocabulary, socialize and walk, and others appear to attend to even less than he does, engaging in near-constant self-stimulating behaviors, like repetitive jaw chomping, collapsing to the floor during class or reciting many times an hour descending notes that resemble a sad bird call. Ms. Bravo believes in mixing students with multiple disabilities of varying severity so they can learn from one another. Donovan remains in his wheelchair, moving his head slightly back and forth to the music, his legs crossed at the knees. A soft ball covered with yellow tape dangles from a rope in front of his wheelchair. A few times during the class, Mr. Toron walks over and gives the ball a tap into Donovan's line of vision. Donovan swipes the ball weakly out of his way with his ungloved right hand, nodding his head in time to the music. Anissia Mack, Donovan's one-to-one aide, stands nearby; she occasionally jangles the ball.

Aides lift another student, Darius Jenkins, 15, out of his wheelchair and place him on an inclined plane, where he lies quivering and drooling slightly for most of the class. He is given a squeeze ball to hold several times, but each time, he drops it. Donovan looks as though he is resting, but when Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" comes on, he smiles and raises his chin. From the back of his throat, he sings a few rough, wordless refrains that loosely follow the beat. Next, it is off to science. Mr. Torres, a first-year teacher, uses all of his creativity to adapt the lessons, writing his own books, using symbols, pictures and words. He circulates around the room, asking students to identify the vocabulary. ""Which is the fruit?"" he asks an intense young student named Isatou, presenting her with a set of two electronic buttons, one marked with a fruit picture, the other with a seed. Sitting on her own, she presses the correct image, evoking the words ""fruit, las frutas"" from the button. ""Good job,"" Mr. Torres said. Working with the apple and the seeds, Ms. Mack, who is in charge of most of Donovan's repetition and drilling, marks his responses on a worksheet. ""As far as what he's retaining, I couldn't tell you,"" Ms. Mack said later. She has worked with him for two years, assigned to him because he is prone to seizures, and said the main change she had noticed was that he seemed calmer. ""But I do think he appreciates getting an education,"" she said. Donovan was born healthy, except for clubbed feet. An operation to correct them had been scheduled when, on Aug. 15, 1990, Ms. Forde left Donovan, nearly 6 months old, with his father while she went to work cleaning offices at night.

""He only knows sitting up and making noises, because he was only 5 months old,"" she said of his current skills. But though he seemed frozen in infancy in some ways, his bad habits worsened. At elementary school in Coney Island, Donovan twice knocked out one of his teeth, arriving home with them in a bag. At home, he began reaching into his diaper and spreading around the mess. Pregnant with her second child, and unable to afford private care, Ms. Forde made the wrenching decision nine years ago to move him to the nursing facility at Coler-Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, where he would get 24-hour attention and Medicaid would foot the bill. He still lives there today, sleeping in a high-walled bed in a room he shares with three other severely disabled youths. Donovan's individual education plan paints a picture of what he is expected to learn at P.S. 79. By November, it says, he will identify directional concepts like top and bottom, left and right with 100 percent accuracy. He will identify four United States coins and common shapes with 100 percent accuracy. He will communicate a message, a desire or need, using an electronic button or tactile icon, five times a day. The problem is that after 15 years of education, he has not learned how to do most of those things reliably. ""Donovan has not yet demonstrated consistent functional communication to indicate purposeful needs,"" his plan states. ""I don't think he can identify shapes,"" his mother said, calling the plan unrealistic. ""He's not identifying anything; he just is thinking, 'O.K., you have something in front of me -- what do you want me to do?' "" Because they need intensive interventions, students like Donovan do not fit neatly into the paradigm for special education that has prevailed in the United States for more than a decade: inclusion. Congress ranks each state for its success in moving special education children into general education classrooms, addressing a core concern in the field -- that too many children are not getting access to the regular curriculum. But whether Donovan is best served in an academic-focused classroom is an uncomfortable question for many educators, because few better options are available, and inclusion ""indicates a level of hope for parents, and the absence of hope is deadly,"" said David Rose, the founder of CAST, a national organization that works to expand learning opportunities for students with disabilities.

""It's an awkward period,"" Mr. Rose said, in talking about the education of children with the most severe cognitive disabilities. ""Because we know what we are doing is not right, and we often don't talk about things when we don't know what we are doing about them yet."" Following federal No Child Left Behind guidelines, New York State standards, even for assessments of the kind Donovan takes, are framed around academic skills. Schools choose the test subjects from a state list that includes items like number awareness, basic geometry and distinguishing living from nonliving things. Of the 1 percent of students statewide who take such assessments, about 90 percent score at a proficient or advanced level, limiting their usefulness as an accountability standard, said Rebecca H. Cort, the state deputy commissioner for special education. ""It's a problem,"" she said. But despite her son's lack of academic progress, Ms. Forde is not dissatisfied. She is grateful that her son goes to school like a regular student, and says that he seems happy most of the time. ""The only goal I had for him was when he was in the hospital after the accident, when the nurse told me he wasn't going to live,"" she said. ""He's here, and he's 20 years old. So he surpassed his goal. He's alive."" There are glimmers that greater communication and interaction with other people, a momentous goal for a student like Donovan, are possible. One day in late March, Donovan sat alone in the cafeteria before dismissal, moving his head from side to side as if discerning rhythms from the busy room around him. He smiled as if he were remembering a secret. ""Who is that, Ray Charles?"" said Roosevelt Adams, gesturing across the room at Donovan. ""Or Stevie Wonder?"" A tall, rangy man with 26 years on the job as a teacher's aide at P.S. 79 (or, as he prefers to be known, an educational assistant), Mr. Adams holds in his mind a kind of Rosetta stone to Donovan's physical language. ""That's his happy mood,"" he said.

Donovan's communications are hard to measure on assessments, and there is no glossary of them posted for teachers to see. So not everyone knows that a head butt, according to Mr. Adams, is how Donovan says no when he gets angry. Or that when Donovan does not want something, he turns his head. When he wants something, ""he lets you give it to him,"" Mr. Adams said, adding that when his head is down, ""that's his low."" Mr. Adams was Donovan's one-to-one aide for four years before Ms. Mack took over two years ago. It is an intimate position to be in; from nearly the moment Donovan gets off the bus to the moment he leaves, the aide feeds him, quizzes him, reads to him, changes him (if the aide is the same gender) and wakes him up when he is dozing. Besides physical therapy at P.S. 79, Donovan receives an hour each of occupational and speech therapy each week, and a half-hour of vision therapy. His classroom teachers must divide their time with 11 other students with multiple disabilities. So more than anyone else at P.S. 79, the teacher's aides may have the best shot at providing the intensive one-on-one time that many experts say it takes to make progress with a student like Donovan. They are also among the lowest paid people in the system, earning between $21,000 and $36,000 a year, and requiring no specific training in special education beyond what they learn on the job. Donovan's love for music requires no translation. He sings in fragmented high-pitched tones, or in throaty notes that blossom into rhythmic phrases. But Mr. Adams got him to achieve more. By getting Donovan into a really happy mood, by tickling him or giving him a head rub, he found he could get him to sing ""Old MacDonald"" with him. And though he does not speak, Donovan managed the ""Old Mac"" and then -- his favorite part -- a loud ""E-I-E-I-O."" ""Singing, that's a form of talking,"" Mr. Adams said, adding that Donovan reminded him of his mother and brother, both of whom were blind. ""He understands very well, quite as much as you and I do. If he could talk, and he could see, he could express himself a little bit better.""

Without knowing it, Mr. Adams's efforts had touched on recent research in educating severely disabled children that focuses on using emotion and human connection to reach them. As higher functioning areas of their brains are underdeveloped, emotion moves them at a deeper level, lighting up the same part of their brain, the limbic system, as meaningful music, and possibly creating a bridge to greater intellectual cognition. ""We are so focused on teaching them skills, we don't focus on the emotional part of the child,"" said Rosanne K. Silberman, who coordinates graduate teacher preparation programs in severe disabilities and blindness at Hunter College. ""You want them to be happy. You want to be about working on showing this kid that he's a worthwhile human being."" Since Mr. Adams was reassigned to other students, Donovan no longer sings ""Old MacDonald,"" aides in his class said. He also appears to have forgotten how to indicate, with a nod, which is more: one marker tapped against his arm or two, said Sharon Naftali, his former classroom teacher who works with him in a yoga class. ""It wasn't practiced,"" she said. But Ms. Bravo said she believed exposing Donovan to change would help him be more flexible in the face of whatever lay ahead for him, likely a residential day program where he will get less one-on-one support than he does now. His therapies are starting to be scaled back in preparation for the transition. ""We find that very often we do a disservice to our kids when they come to depend on just one person,"" she said. Donovan is the only legally blind student in his class, and when teachers take that into account, he comes alive. One Thursday afternoon, Timothy Carton, his English teacher, filled his brightly colored classroom with choruses of bird calls, the chirps of cardinals and blue jays causing Donovan to sing back. An interactive smart board narrated a simple story. ""Donovan, this is the big nest,"" Mr. Carton explained in a bright tone, holding a handmade nest of twigs next to Donovan's hand. ""It's round. It goes round and round and round. And in the middle is the bird,"" he said, putting a chirping red plastic cardinal in his hand. ""Can you feel the bird? Can you pick the bird up? The bird flies around, and you put the bird back in its nest."" He put his hand over Donovan's to guide him through the motions.

But in math class, Donovan was unable, as were most of his classmates, to distinguish a dollar from a quarter, or participate in an exercise in which he was told it would cost $1 to buy a plastic model of French fries and 25 cents for a plastic toy version of a doughnut. An aide working with him and another student could not get a clear response, and after a few minutes, stopped trying. One morning in mid-March, there was an accomplishment. In a modified yoga class called Getting Ready to Learn, Donovan's vision teacher slipped off both of his gloves and spent time massaging his stiff arms, which tend to stay bent at right angles. Calmed, he was able to keep them off for the rest of the day. ""If I have one issue with the Department of Education, it's that one size doesn't fit all,"" said Barbara Levine, the vision teacher, who has worked in city special education schools for 25 years and who wants Donovan to have a music class. ""What I'm seeing is that what they are doing is a great fit for 15 to 20 percent of the kids, and the rest of them, we go well over their heads,"" she said. Ms. Bravo said her goal was to strike a balance between functional and academic instruction, focusing on what is really important: the skills that Donovan will need to help communicate to caregivers in the years ahead. Whether that actually took place, she said, will be looked at. She is retiring this year, but will recommend that the school scale back its class-switching experiment next year, Donovan's last. Although the teachers and many of the students seemed to relish the dynamism of the curriculum, it proved too much for a single teacher to learn the individual learning styles of dozens of highly challenged students. But Ms. Bravo is confident the school is moving in the right direction. ""I believe we are a special place,"" she said. ""Are we perfect? No. But no place is."""
53585,Rising Costs a Concern for Land-Lease Building Owners,"Land-lease buildings in New York rent the ground on which they stand. With land prices soaring, unit owners in these buildings worry that their costs will rise.",Michael and Diane Schoeman are shareholders in the Trump Plaza co-op building.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/14/realestate/14COV2/14COV2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=38b2ed9b310f4f8a2bb0b440ce7ae756ee5262956c7e72a6264a1bed1a73d0e5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/realestate/rising-costs-a-concern-for-land-lease-building-owners-in-new-york.html,0d9bd4c3-8f69-5e47-a243-6c02802f5566.jpg,"Marc Cooper knew exactly what he was getting into in 2011 when he purchased three apartments at Trump Plaza. The co-op, at 167 East 61st Street, was on a land lease, which meant the building did not own the land on which it stood, and paid rent to a landowner. That rent was scheduled to skyrocket in 2023, which would triple monthly maintenance fees and affect the value of the apartments. ""I always knew it was a spectacular building. But I also understood the risk,"" said Mr. Cooper, a vice chairman of the Peter J. Solomon Company, the investment bank. ""I always said my goal was to get on the co-op board and buy the land."" Earlier this year, Mr. Cooper, who became the board's president, realized his objective, helping cobble together $190 million in cash to buy the land underneath the building. ""We took a storied building from what could have been the depths of despair and restored it to where it is now on par with some of the best buildings on the Upper East Side,"" Mr. Cooper said.

Approximately 100 buildings in Manhattan have land or ground leases, according to several people in the real estate industry. They are mostly co-ops, although the list includes some condominiums. These buildings tend to have high monthly carrying charges because of the rental payments for the land. And as the co-ops do not pay real estate taxes, shareholders cannot deduct as much from income taxes as shareholders in typical co-ops do. On the other hand, land-lease apartments tend to cost less than the competition. ""Discounts in land-lease buildings are 25 percent, although I'm beginning to think it is more like 35 to 40 percent,"" said Susan Landau Abrams, an associate broker at Warburg Realty. Ms. Abrams lives at 190 East 72nd Street, a land-lease co-op, and is marketing a four-bedroom there for $4 million, with a monthly maintenance fee of $14,000. She says it is deeply discounted. ""This unit would probably be $8 million if it wasn't a land lease,"" she added. ""The value of the apartments decrease because the maintenance is so obnoxiously high,"" said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime Manhattan Residential. He had a buyer who recently fell in love with an apartment at the Beekman, a land-lease co-op at 575 Park Avenue. ""I talked him out of it. When you look at an apartment that's been on the market for 48 weeks, and is a great apartment at a good price, you need to understand that if you buy it and then look to sell, you will face the same set of circumstances. It is unfortunate, but true."" But some people consider land-lease apartments a buying opportunity. ""We have found that many sales to date have been people who are sophisticated in financial real estate and who are comfortable with the terms,"" said Julia Hodgson, the director of development for the World Wide Group, which is building a land-lease condominium at 252 East 57th Street with Rose Associates. ""There is perceived risk and that accounts for a portion of the discount. On the flip side, you get tremendous value for the money.""

Land-lease buildings aren't unique to New York. Many buildings in London are subject to ground leases that can run for 1,000 years; the queen is often the landowner, said Stuart M. Saft, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight. In New York, many land-lease co-ops date to the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the market was strong and there was a housing shortage. Some landowners decided to keep the land, rather than sell it to a developer, in order to maintain a rental income for themselves and their heirs, said Adam Leitman Bailey, who practices real estate law in New York. In recent years, as the price of land surged to historic levels, some owners of land-lease apartments began biting their nails. Many land-lease buildings pay the landowner rent based on a percentage of the value of the land. ""All over Manhattan, land values are escalating at a very rapid pace,"" said Brian Corcoran, an executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield who advised the Trump Plaza board on its land purchase. ""There are many co-ops on ground leases and it is rare that shareholders get a chance to buy the land. But if they do, it is in their best interest to do so if at all possible."" The Excelsior, a land-lease co-op at 303 East 57th Street, is facing a potential rent increase. According to the terms of its lease, every 10 years the rent resets to 6 percent of the value of the land. The co-op's next reset will be in 2018. With prices rising, particularly along 57th Street, where a dozen luxury towers are underway, shareholders are growing anxious that the land rent could rise precipitously. ""There is a potential for a high rent payout,"" said Arnold Rosenshein, the president of Excelsior's board, ""but it depends on how it falls out with the economy. If the city goes into a tailspin, then the rent goes down, but if the values stay as high as they are now, it could go up.""

Because the Excelsior and its landowner have gone through rent resets before, a bargaining process has been established, whereby each side presents its case to a neutral arbitrator who then determines the land's market value. The building is in talks with the landowner to work out a deal or, possibly, a sale, but if nothing pans out, arbitration will proceed. The land rent at the Excelsior, 303 East 57th Street, will reset in 2018. Co-op owners in land-lease buildings must also confront lease expirations. Every lease is different, but most are lengthy, extending 99 years or more. But as they tick down, problems may arise. For instance, residents of buildings that have less than 30 years left on their leases may have difficulty securing mortgages. ""Banks are a little bit wary of land-lease buildings,"" said Ace Watanasuparp, the regional manager for Citizens Bank. ""If a buyer takes a 30-year mortgage, but the land lease only has 17 years left, who knows what will happen."" The expiration of a lease is particularly fraught for land-lease co-ops that were once rent-regulated apartment buildings. When their land leases expire, these co-ops will be dissolved and the apartments will once again become rent regulated, with the landowner becoming the landlord, Mr. Saft said. Unless new terms are negotiated, the co-op shareholders could become tenants of their former homes. ""This has not happened yet, to my knowledge,"" Mr. Corcoran said. ""But it will."" As for Trump Plaza, when Donald Trump built the co-op in 1983, he struck a deal with the landowner in which for 40 years, the building would pay a below-market annual rent of approximately $1.2 million. But in 2023, the rent would become 8 percent of the value of the land. Mr. Corcoran could not estimate what that might be, but he advised the board that today the land would be worth about $200 million, making the annual rent $16 million. By this calculation, Mr. Cooper's monthly maintenance fee on his three combined apartments would rise to just over $33,000 a month from the $11,000 he was paying before the land purchase earlier this year.

""The building's monthly maintenance charges were already well above the market, and this would have tripled it, essentially rendering the apartments without value,"" said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, who advised Trump Plaza on the deal. ""It would not have been logical. A one-bedroom would have had a monthly maintenance of $13,000. No one would have bought it."" Mr. Cooper now pays around $9,100 a month in monthly maintenance fees. The Trump Plaza deal was anything but certain. ""We had multiple conversations, but the owners were never interested in selling,"" Mr. Cooper said. ""Then lo and behold, last summer, there were issues going on with the extended family that owned the land, and there was a frothy market, so they decided to put it up for sale."" The co-op had the right of first refusal, so it scrambled to find the money. It could have taken out a mortgage, but then the building would have been highly leveraged.

Several owners, however, could not afford to pay outright. For them, the co-op had to find a solution. Some banks were wary about giving mortgages to help pay the assessment, but the board was able to work out a deal with Wells Fargo, which wrote approximately $50 million worth of mortgages for building shareholders. Still others could neither pay the assessment nor obtain a mortgage. The co-op lent them the money at 5 percent interest until they could sell their units and use the proceeds to pay off their share. To pay these ""support loans,"" the co-op board borrowed the money with plans to repay it within the next 12 to 18 months, as the apartments are sold, Mr. Janangelo said. Michael and Diane Schoeman received one of the support loans. They say they did not know that the land rent would rise in 2023 when they purchased two units at Trump Plaza for $2.315 million in February 2011. They then spent $1.5 million combining and renovating them. But after their son had twins, they decided to downsize in New York and buy a home closer to their grandchildren in Connecticut. The couple put their home on the market in 2014 for just under $5 million, and say they had two potential buyers before they learned of the land rent situation. ""Then no one would pull the trigger,"" Mr. Schoeman said. Once the land deal came through, the Schoemans were assessed $2.8 million. They relisted the apartment for $6.595 million, raising the price because the building no longer had a land lease. They readjusted the price to $5.995 million after 45 days on the market, and are now in contract for somewhat below the asking price, Mr. Schoeman said. After the sale closes, with the additional taxes and other fees, they expect to walk away about $2 million poorer. ""I got hurt. A few other people got hurt,"" Mr. Schoeman said. ""But by and large, it was the best thing that could have ever happened to Trump Plaza. Without doing what they did, nobody would have ever been able to sell their apartment."""

25199,How a 'Walking Dead' Guru Brought 'Creepshow' Back to Life,"The 1982 film, directed by George Romero and written by Stephen King, changed Greg Nicotero's life. Now he has brought the franchise full circle, and invited his old friends.","Nicotero, now an executive producer on ""The Walking Dead,"" still designs special effects.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/arts/26creepshow7/26creepshow7-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d96758768ea7d334673a0b6a1bf11bf745dbc6a9bcfb9fa608ee845bfa0e5945&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/arts/television/creepshow-reboot-greg-nicotero.html,e9a656be-f233-54c8-acad-5f0a227d90d2.jpg,"Greg Nicotero learned about horror filmmaking and special effects on the set of the film ""Creepshow."" Now he's making a new version, as a six-episode series on Shudder.





Before he made his name figuring out creative ways for zombies to stalk people, or for s erial killers to dismember people, or for cannibal piranhas to eat people, Greg Nicotero had plans to eventually take over his father's medical practice . Then George Romero called. It was 198 1. Romero, who had galvanized the horror genre with gritty, socially aware films like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" was filming ""Creepshow"" near Nicotero's home in Pittsburgh. Stephen King, who already had multiple hit novels to his name, had written the script, his first. The makeup and effects master Tom Savini, famous in the business for his work on movies like ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Friday the 13th,"" was doing the blood and guts and monsters. Nicotero, who was still in high school, had stayed in touch with Romero, a fellow Pittsburgher, since meeting him on a family vacation in Rome. Now the director wanted to know: Was he interested in a set visit? ""Living in Pittsburgh, I never imagined that the film industry or special effects or doing monsters or any of this stuff -- I never even knew that that was a job,"" Nicotero, 56, said in a recent phone interview. ""To me, it was a hobby.""

This one he simply calls ""my baby."" Nicotero's timing seems auspicious, given the wave of '80s horror nostalgia currently sweeping pop culture. The Netflix hit ""Stranger Things"" openly cribs from vintage King -- and by extension, Savini and his heirs. The killer doll Chucky was reanimated in cinemas this summer. The new season of ""American Horror Story,"" which began last week , is set in a summer camp in 1984. The new ""Creepshow"" is, of course, a tribute to the original and its 1987 sequel. But those films were themselves tributes to midcentury comic books like ""Tales from the Crypt,"" which connoisseurs like Romero, King and Savini grew up reading. The first film was structured to convey the page-turning immediacy of a comic book, divided into five short, discrete tales taken from a fictional comic called Creepshow. King's son Joe, then 8 years old, plays a boy who gets in trouble for reading it. ""It's celebrating horror's ability to be so important and desirable for young viewers and readers who know that they're doing something their parents probably would not approve of,"" said Adam Lowenstein, a University of Pittsburgh professor who has written extensively about the genre's history. The movie was child-centered, he argued, without being childish.

""That's an important tradition in the genre to honor,"" he said. ""An important way to understand the original 'Creepshow' is it's King and Romero honoring the children they were, and the ways that they got energized and electrified by the genre in the first place."" Nicotero, in turn, found multiple ways for his series to honor the film that had energized him. One was by hiring his friend and former mentor Savini, whom he first met on the set of ""Creepshow,"" as a director -- proof, as Savini put it, that the student had truly become the master.

""It completely turned around: He became the teacher,"" said Savini, 72, describing his experience on set. ""I wanted to impress him; I wanted to please him. So getting his stamp of approval, or his suggestions -- I listened to everything he said."" Another was by emphasizing short-form storytelling: Episodes are segmented, each comprising two roughly 20-minute stories. Based on the premiere (the only episode provided to journalists in advance), the show preserves the film's gleefully over-the-top gross-outs. The first segment, adapted from a Stephen King story , includes a lot of flesh-eating -- a ""Creepshow"" tradition. The second stars a severed head. It also preserves some of Romero's formal devices, such as the sudden shifts in color, or the one in which the camera scans a comic book, then dissolves into a live-action freeze-frame.

""I really felt that what was critical was recreating that idea that you're picking up a comic book and you're reading a comic book,"" Nicotero said. Still, he didn't want to confine himself too much, he added, pointing to the freedom that came from doing short segments with a variety of writers and casts. ""The great thing about it is, there are no rules,"" he said. ""You have a different experience every time you watch an episode."" One of those episodes includes an adaptation of ""By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain,"" a story by that same son of King's who appeared in the 1982 film -- known today as the best-selling horror author Joe Hill. From there, the string of connections loops around again: ""Champlain"" was directed by Savini, with whom Hill spent formative time on the set as a child. Savini, Hill said, had been his ""definition of cool"" when they met, his ""first rock star."" ""He had the leather jacket, and he had these eyebrows like Spock -- I sat there and I'd watch him artistically disfigure movie stars and create creatures,"" Hill said in an interview this spring tied to ""NOS4A2,"" an AMC series based on his novel. He recalled being sent to hang out in Savini's trailer for 10 days -- the closest thing the production had to on-set child care, he joked.

Nicotero modestly disagrees, insisting at every opportunity on Savini's enormous influence on his career. But becoming a showrunner had empowered him to offer more than thanks. Despite Savini's vast experience doing effects in recent decades for directors like Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, he hadn't directed anything major since his remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1990). When Nicotero offered him a script, Savini leapt at the opportunity. ""Forget the money, you know, it was worth it just to get Greg's approval and then for him to trust me,"" Savini said. ""He trusted me to still have my mojo."" For both men, their collaboration, like the entire ""Creepshow"" reboot, was clearly meaningful -- a fitting tribute to Romero and their friendship. But for Nicotero, it also just made sense. ""To me, the modern horror genre is defined, in part, by Tom Savini and George Romero, so I couldn't imagine doing 'Creepshow' without Tom."" he said. ""And for me to be able to turn around and offer him this opportunity -- an opportunity that he really had wanted to pursue -- that really meant the world to me."""

In March, The New York Times reported that scientists and officials with the N.I.H.'s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism met with alcohol industry groups on several occasions in 2013 and 2014 to discuss funding.

During the meetings, scientists suggested the research might reflect favorably on moderate drinking, while institute officials pressed the groups for support, according to documents obtained by The Times.

The Serbian-born Roksanda Ilincic shows her Roksanda collection at 10 a.m., followed an hour later by the Canadian designer Erdem Moralioglu, whose Erdem brand is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.

A stalwart of British fashion, Pringle of Scotland, shows its latest knitted offerings at noon, and then the eyes of the industry turn to Burberry at 1 p.m. This will be Christopher Bailey's first collection since his announcement that the brand will be switching to a see-now, buy-now approach that mixes men's and women's clothes in twice-yearly collections. No doubt the ever-dependable front row circus of Brit models, singers and social media stars from far-flung locations -- chosen with emerging luxury market potential, of course -- will be in place.

The industry darling Christopher Kane will show at 3 p.m. and Peter Pilotto at 5. Then, at 7 p.m., Giles Deacon concludes the day with his final ready-to-wear show before packing for Paris to join the couture schedule in July.

Born of the need for secrecy, slang has long dominated pot culture. But as entrepreneurs seek to capitalize on new laws legalizing recreational and medical marijuana, they too are grappling with what to call it. Heading to the dispensary to buy a few nugs or dabs? Marketers seeking to exploit the $10 billion market would prefer that you just called it cannabis. Shirley Halperin, an author of 2007's ""Pot Culture: The A-Z Guide to Stoner Language and Life,"" has seen the shift in recent years. Not long ago, she met with an executive to talk about his company's products. ""He physically winced when I said the word 'pot,'"" she recalled. ""Businesses don't want to call it 'weed.'"" Cannabis, she said, ""sounds like it has purpose in the world."" [Reefer madness or pot paradise? Read about the surprising legacy of the place where legal weed began.]

Like anything, the history of pot, weed or whatever you want to call it is complicated. During the Jazz Age, when singers wrote odes to the plant, it was called dope, reefer and tea. It was a drug of choice for the hippie counterculture 30 years later, often referred to as grass. Willie Nelson sang a song about pot. ""I still call it weed,"" said Tommy Chong, half of the Cheech & Chong comedy duo that defined stoner culture in the 1970s and '80s. ""Yeah, I think it's the easiest. You can tell what age people are by the words they use."" At Cannes Lions in June, a conference in France for marketers, a panel of experts debated the language and perception of cannabis in today's culture. ""There is a generational divide when it comes to language,"" Ms. Halperin said. ""What was O.K., say, 10 years ago is out now."" Words that sounded cool in the '60s and '70s (remember wacky tobacky?) are woefully old-fashioned now. That's especially true given that recreational marijuana is legal in 11 states and the District of Columbia. Medical marijuana has even broader appeal.

""Words we think of today as leftovers from the 1960s are really leftover from the 1930s,"" he said. But it is important to look even further back, he added. Terms like cannabis and ganja go back centuries, and have long been used to describe the plant and its medicinal properties. With recreational marijuana becoming legal in several states, cannabis products are becoming more easily available and increasingly varied.

* None Use on the Rise: Federal survey data on substance use Federal survey data on substance use shows the growing mainstream acceptance of cannabis and hallucinogenic compounds among young adults. Indeed, the word ""marijuana"" was introduced to the English language as recently as 1874 and was derived from Spanish, Mr. Sokolowski said. And it was the Spaniards who brought cannabis to Mexico's land, which they hoped to cultivate for industrial-use hemp. They had a number of spellings for the word, including ""mariguana"" and ""marihuana."" But unlike the word ""cannabis,"" it picked up a negative meaning. In 2013, NPR wrote a thorough explanation of the word in which people said it had racist and anti-immigrant implications. In the piece, NPR cited news articles from the early 20th century suggesting that marijuana -- or marihuana -- was responsible for inciting violence among Mexicans who smoked it. It was sometimes called ""loco weed."" (Loco means ""crazy"" in Spanish.) That imagery was part of an anti-cannabis movement and helped to prompt a crackdown on illegal cannabis use, which culminated in the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. ""Suddenly the drug has a whole new identity,"" NPR wrote. Mr. Chong, who has argued in favor of legal cannabis, agreed. ""It became evil,"" he said. Long before Snoop Dogg became a de facto ambassador for the cannabis industry, Mr. Chong, now 81, and his comedy partner, Cheech Marin, poked fun at stoner culture in their movies, playing affable smokers on the run from the police. ""I was known as the pothead guy,"" Mr. Chong said. In 1978's ""Up in Smoke,"" they drive a van from Mexico to Los Angeles that is made of resin from cannabis plants. In 1981's ""Nice Dreams,"" they sell marijuana out of an ice cream truck.

In the 1930s, Mr. Chong said, jazz musicians and their fans spoke in code about cannabis because it had been demonized. That's when words like dope, grass, pot, weed, tea and reefer became popular. In 1932, Cab Calloway and his orchestra recorded ""Reefer Man."" The next year, the jazz musician Benny Goodman and his orchestra recorded the song ""Texas Tea Party."" ""People used to stand outside of clubs and sell tiny joints for $1,"" Mr. Chong said. ""It was just enough to give you a buzz."" Reefer, though, acquired a particularly sinister connotation with the 1936 release of ""Reefer Madness,"" a propaganda film meant to warn teenagers of the plant's ill effects. ""Marijuana! The burning weed with its roots in hell!"" exclaimed the trailer. The movie caused a wave of fear and public debate. ""They did it to demean, knock people down, to vilify them,"" Mr. Chong said.

Mr. Chong, who has his own cannabis brand, recalled an interview years ago when he had been asked if he smoked pot. ""No, I'm into hemp,"" he said he told the interviewer, who looked puzzled. ""I said, it is just a name. It's just a word. When it went from pot to hemp it went from bad to good."" Still, old stereotypes are hard to shake. Mr. Chong said some dispensaries had declined to sell his products because of his movie persona. ""We represent the stoner image of Mexicans,"" he said. ""They don't want that anymore. They can't market that to millennials."" Younger consumers are also increasingly turning to cannabis concentrates like shatter and wax. But millennials, according to an informal poll I took of twentysomethings I know, tend to call cannabis ""weed."" (Sorry, marketers!) ""Welp, I don't know anyone who calls it pot to be honest,"" one respondent said. ""Everyone just says, 'Do you wanna smoke?'""

Ms. Halperin said the names will continue to multiply as new products flood the market. Doobies, muggles and Mary Jane are out. ""Dabs, vape, those are new terms,"" she said. ""I hear 'pre-roll' used a lot in conversation."" A pre-roll is exactly what it sounds like: a pre-rolled joint. One thing is certain, though, she said. ""No one wants to say the word stoner anymore."""
13547,"Three Tests, a Private Jet and a New Rule: How Nick Saban Made Kickoff",Alabama's immense resources and a newly developed Southeastern Conference policy paved the way for Saban to return to the field only days after he tested positive for the coronavirus.,Alabama pulled out all the stops to have Nick Saban available to coach against Georgia last weekend.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/sports/21saban-new/21saban-new-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=226939737cc1f0e29c70d3924da35e28b093a7f4920e55a419d8e7511819077f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/sports/ncaafootball/saban-virus-tests-alabama.html,0944e354-4357-5939-927b-d5023ba9d8e6.jpg,"A private jet, the crimson ""A"" of the University of Alabama painted on its tail, lifted off from Tuscaloosa, Ala., around daybreak Saturday with extraordinary cargo: cellular debris collected from the nose of Nick Saban, the football coach. Three days earlier, Saban had announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Now, still in isolation hours before second-ranked Alabama was to play third-ranked Georgia, Saban knew the specimen aboard the plane was his diagnostic lifeline to the sideline. If a laboratory in Mobile, Ala., reported that the sample was negative for the virus, Saban, who had asserted that he had no symptoms and had repeatedly tested negative after his initial result, would be allowed to leave isolation a week early and coach in the prime-time game. And so it was. Hours after a final negative result -- and with no small help from a rule change that Southeastern Conference leaders approved six days before the positive test that shocked Alabama -- millions of people watched on television as Saban led the Crimson Tide to a 41-24 victory. The episode underscored two aspects of the response to the virus: Even the most rigorous tests -- in this case a polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., widely considered the gold standard of infectious disease diagnostics -- can falter. And, more than seven months into the nation's coronavirus crisis, access to testing remains inconsistent, except among America's elite.

Alabama's football program is clearly one of the haves. Anchored by one of the most celebrated brands in college football -- the team claims 17 national championships, including five during Saban's tenure, now in its 14th season -- Alabama's athletic department is among the country's wealthiest. Supported each year by more than $100 million in broadcast rights, donations and ticket sales alone, the athletic department markets itself as one of the college landscape's self-sustaining programs. Bryant-Denny Stadium just had a $107 million renovation, and Saban is to earn more than $9 million this season. As the pandemic has strained athletic finances on campuses nationwide, it has, in some ways, put Alabama's resources and football obsession on greater display. The SEC, for instance, requires its football teams to be tested at least three times a week under a protocol that hinges almost entirely on P.C.R. testing, one of the most accurate and expensive techniques on the market. But Alabama opted for daily screenings of its football players and coaches.

P.C.R.-based tests for the virus hunt for specific stretches of genetic material, which they can copy repeatedly until their targets reach detectable levels. That makes it easy to identify the virus, even when it is scarce, and difficult to mistake something else for the pathogen. But as with any procedure, mistakes are possible. Differences in the way the test samples are handled, processed and analyzed can upend results. Pressure to speed up the turnaround time for results could also make it harder to keep machines running in tiptop shape, or to ensure consistency from test to test. ""The most likely culprit was probably some sort of contamination,"" possibly from a nearby sample that came from someone who actually had the virus, said Sarah Jung, the scientific director of clinical microbiology at Children's Hospital Colorado. ""This is detecting things we can't see. That makes it all the more difficult."" Mishaps are also bound to happen during a flood of tests. Alabama's athletic department has said little about its testing throughout the pandemic, but the football program is administering at least 120 screenings a day, Saban suggested on ESPN on Saturday. The SEC's 14 athletic programs are collectively running thousands of P.C.R. tests every week.

""It's a game of numbers,"" Dr. Jung said. ""I'm not saying it's inevitable, but when groups like this test a lot, the chances for a situation like this to occur increase."" Even under ideal circumstances, the best products will occasionally fail, Dr. Jha said. ""There is not something that is 100 percent perfect,"" he said. ""That's why you do confirmatory tests."" Alabama swiftly began its investigation into Saban's positive result. There were medical reasons to try to confirm the result, but urgent football ones, too. Less than a week before Saban said he had tested positive, the SEC's chancellors and presidents had approved an update to the league's medical protocols. Under the new policy, an asymptomatic person like Saban who tested positive for the virus could take another P.C.R. test within 24 hours. If that test yielded a negative result, the person could take two more P.C.R. tests, each separated by 24 hours. If all three results were negative, the player, coach or staff member could return to athletics. It is unusual to administer a follow-up screening after someone tests positive by P.C.R., and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that such a result send an asymptomatic person into isolation for 10 days. But in the weeks before Saban's test, the conference had an experience with a false positive involving a soccer player at Texas A&M, Sports Illustrated reported. And the league's medical experts had also begun to worry about the potential public health effects of an unchecked false positive: a person's being dropped from routine testing and perhaps acquiring a sense of invincibility that they could no longer contract the virus -- potential fodder for an outbreak, should that person be exposed. ""The repercussions for that false positive aren't just for that athlete,"" said Dr. Catherine O'Neal, an infectious disease specialist at Louisiana State University and a member of the SEC's medical task force. ""It puts the entire team at risk.""

Still, Dr. O'Neal said she had worried about endorsing a protocol that ""debunks a test result."" ""There's so much attention around the validity of these tests, and for us who work in health care, just convincing patients to trust us and trust getting tested has become a struggle,"" she said. ""We don't want to give the perception that we don't believe these tests."" The tipping point, she recalled in an interview Tuesday, had been ""the increased awareness that false positives do occur."" Despite the slight variances of the SEC's new protocol from others' guidelines, outside experts said that a lone positive result among so many negative P.C.R. tests was almost certainly inaccurate. Rules made clear that Saban could not coach, even from home, if he had the virus. If Alabama wanted Saban in charge against Georgia, the new approach was its only option. And even if the plan worked, it would not be clear until sometime Saturday, the day of a game long seen as one to shape the race toward the College Football Playoff. Less than 24 hours after the positive result, Saban took the first of the three SEC-sanctioned tests he would need to pass to exit isolation. His first formal follow-up tests, conducted around 7 a.m. on Thursday and Friday, showed negative results, as did two other P.C.R. tests that Alabama ordered ""out of an abundance of caution"" at another lab. Alabama announced the first SEC test's results, and ESPN reported the findings of the second as it broadcast from Alabama's stadium on Saturday morning. Word had already begun to circulate through the SEC that Saban might prove eligible to coach. Driving the last specimen to Mobile would have taken more than three hours on game day, potentially stripping Saban of precious time with his team. So Alabama athletics turned to its speediest option: its jet."

""I'd walk into factories with my dreadlocks, not speaking Italian,"" he said with a laugh. ""I was very green."" And he was received, he recalled, with ""curious discomfort."" Twenty-two years later -- and now the head of his own under-the-radar knitwear label, Sansovino 6, as well as a consultant for luxury fashion houses -- he is still one of the few black men working in Italian fashion. ""Every fashion house I worked at in Italy, or consulted for,"" he said, ""I was the only person of color on the design team."" But as Prada's Sambo charm, Gucci's blackface balaclava sweater and Dolce & Gabbana's stereotypical videos on China roil the fashion world, the industry may finally be waking up to its lack of racial representation and cultural understanding. And Mr. Buchanan finds himself as an activist, a role he had not expected. ""Many houses here don't employ creatives of color,"" said Mr. Buchanan, 48. ""The conversations that I'm having, and I want to have, on this subject are super important.""

Emanuele Farneti, editor of Vogue Italia, wrote in an email: ""For many years, Italy, like other countries, has ignored the subject of diversity. You need the courage to admit it."" But, he continued, ""In a historic moment in Italy in which a political agenda of selfishness and closure is prevailing, some encouraging signals are there. We're growing a new generation of Italians who consider diversity the norm both in music and sport. We also hope in the fashion industry that so desperately needs it."" Certainly, things have changed -- somewhat. Max Mara, where Mr. Buchanan once worked, has a senior designer from Sierra Leone who has been with the house since 2000 (company policy bars naming members of the design team). In October Roberto Cavalli, in partnership with the nonprofit organization Fra Noi, hired three refugees from Gambia, Pakistan and El Salvador to work in its pattern-cutting department, atelier and Just Cavalli's style office. And Lawrence Steele, an African-American designer who is the associate creative director of Marni and who has lived and worked in Milan for years, said, ""I've had no difficulties whatsoever in getting a job. They've happened spontaneously, and at the brands where I have worked, there has been a language of openness."" He said that Marni has long had a multicultural design team.

The Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana, the Italian fashion trade association, said it does not have statistics on the racial breakdown of industry workers in Italy . However, Carlo Capasa, the organization's president, said he believed the issue was one of availability. ""There aren't so many designers of color showing here but not because it's a problem of discrimination,"" he said during an interview. ""Traditionally Italy has been an extremely homogeneous population. Simply put, we don't have a large population of color. "" A spokesman for Italy's National Institute of Statistics, which maintains the country's census, said it would not release information about the racial makeup of the population. Mr. Buchanan is not entirely convinced. ""There are loopholes in the system where creatives are not even arriving at the door. It's the headhunters, the education system,"" he said. ""It's not a question of hiring designers solely because of diversity's sake. There are talented people of color in the system now, more than qualified for these jobs, and they're not being selected."" So he has been addressing the reality in the most effective way he knows how: with a collection. He started in 2017 with the project ""Check Your Neck,"" featuring three jacquard scarves emblazoned with slogans : ""Resist,"" ""Wake Up for Freedom"" and ""We Are All Migrants."" Mr. Buchanan gave them to the model Aymeline Valade and to his designer friends like Stefano Pilati; Riccardo Tisci and Marcelo Burlon, who is behind the County of Milan label and co-founder of the New Guards Group (its labels include Off-White and Palm Angels; LVMH is reportedly considering a stake).

The scarves are sold on the Sansovino website for about $45 (the cost of manufacturing, Mr. Buchanan said) and with the request that customers post photos of themselves wearing the scarves or communicate in some way what the slogans mean to them. ""After the elections here and in America, and living as a black man in Italy,"" Mr. Buchanan said, ""I wanted to question what was going on."" Now he's trying to build on that momentum with a capsule women's wear line he was scheduled to introduce on Wednesday . With 10 styles based on his favorite basics, including a dickey, biker shorts, leggings and a roll-neck sweater, the knitwear collection is being offered in hues that reflect a full spectrum of skin tones. The goal, Mr. Buchanan said, is to be the Fenty Beauty of knits -- although this being the cashmere business, colors have names like shore (cream), vintage vicuna (brown) and hoopoe (pink.) ""The first idea we own is the color of our skin,"" Mr. Buchanan said. ""Whether you're Irish, Jamaican or Korean, I love the idea you put something on that blends with your skin."" In addition, dense fringes and multicolored jacquards on the sweaters are meant to symbolize the flags of countries like Germany, the United States and Italy, countries where immigrants often continue to be perceived as outsiders. ""These settlers may be third generation but they inhabit the fringes of society,"" Mr. Buchanan said. ""I wanted to build awareness and question it.""

Mr. Buchanan later left Italy for New York and went on to consult for Jennifer Lopez's Sweetface line and Sean Combs's Sean John collection, eventually closing Leflesh to concentrate on his outside work. In 2009 he returned to Milan and the following year he started Sansovino 6, naming the unisex cashmere line for the factory that produced it. The singer-songwriter Erykah Badu snapped up early pieces. Now Mr. Buchanan is hopeful the industry will start another conversation. Last week Prada announced plans to create an inclusion advisory committee led by the artist and activist Theaster Gates and the director Ava DuVernay. Mr. Buchanan described the move as ""very positive,"" although he noted that brands ""tend to run to the upper echelons of celebrity when addressed with such issues'' rather than turning for advice to people already working in the business. ""A diverse design team has the power to nip cultural mistakes in the bud,"" he said.

40390,A User's Guide to the Whitney Biennial,"Somewhat smaller but more focused than in recent years, the 78th edition of the biennial has diversity, political conviction and many canvases.","Laminated glass boxes by the West Coast artist Larry Bell, part of the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/09/arts/09BIENNIAL/09WHITNEY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9ddc8ad66dee721539cee5e4ac1aa1a9a896d42282b6d8c942408471c75632dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/arts/design/a-users-guide-to-the-whitney-biennial.html,be2cb04f-f5b9-59f9-8899-5c25d9ff50a2.jpg,"Laminated glass boxes by the West Coast artist Larry Bell , part of the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art.



Everything had to be reinvented for the 2017 Whitney Biennial -- the first to take place in the new riverside home of the Whitney Museum. But then, this leading showcase of contemporary American art feels refreshed in other ways, too. In a generational shift, the Whitney has chosen two young curators for this always anticipated exhibition: Christopher Y. Lew, 36, and Mia Locks, 34. It's also the first time that the biennial's curators are both people of color. After months on the road, they have boiled down the art of the last few years into a survey that, for all its energy, doesn't overwhelm the museum. The biennial will always be a show people like to fight about. But before the arguments and debates begin, let me tell you about a walk I took with the pair through the in-progress installation. What follows is a user's guide to the 78th Whitney Biennial, which opens to the public on March 17. (My colleague Roberta Smith will publish her review on that date.)

The show is ambitious, but it's tight. There are 63 participants, which puts it back on the scale of the 2010 and 2012 biennials after the hundred-artist-plus blowout of 2014. Though it occupies only two floors of the new building, and much of the lobby, the exhibition enjoys more square footage than in its previous, Marcel Breuer-designed home. The curators have also capitalized on the Whitney's enviable cityside balconies, which will feature art both massive (a suite of red laminated glass boxes by the West Coast veteran Larry Bell) and invisible (a sound work by the young artist Zarouhie Abdalian). Even the floor-to-ceiling windows of the building's fifth floor have been overtaken by a riotously colorful composition from the artist Raul de Nieves, which will be visible from the street after nightfall.

Black, Latino and Asian artists are well represented in this biennial -- which hasn't always been the case for editions past. Yet Mr. Lew and Ms. Locks have steered away from direct advocacy, and many artists here, from the photographer Deana Lawson to the filmmaker Tuan Andrew Nguyen, approach questions of identity with dreaminess, nostalgia, satire and wit. One of the show's senior figures is the Chicago artist William Pope.L -- who facetiously called himself ""the friendliest black artist in America,"" and whose views on race and self are wildly unfixed. Here he reworks a 2014 installation in which hundreds of slices of bologna are fixed with small, hard-to-decipher photos. Mr. Pope.L suggests in an adjacent text that the photos represent Jewish people -- but then again, the sitters may not be Jewish at all. Take the pungent bologna any way you like it. Ms. Locks put it this way: ""I love the idea that it's this perfect grid, this perfect system, with the most false, sloppy data points you've ever seen. Literally deteriorating."" Compared with the organizers of the 2014 biennial, who hung a floor apiece in the old Breuer building, this year's curators are a simpatico pair. Mr. Lew is an associate curator at the Whitney. Ms. Locks is an independent curator who recently left MoMA PS1 -- and Mr. Lew is an alum of that museum, too. They finish each other's sentences. They struggle to recall which of them first proposed a number of the artists on view.

The duo also relied on a committee of advisers from inside the museum (Scott Rothkopf, the Whitney's chief curator) and outside, like the writer Negar Azimi. ""We would meet for full days, have dinner together,"" Mr. Lew explained. ""One time we were all in the same giant Airbnb ----"" ""Like 'The Real World,'"" Ms. Locks interjected. ""It became a nice punctuation point for our process. Obviously, we've been in a deep collaborative hole, and we spend way too much time together"" -- they both laughed -- ""so it's nice to get outside your own head once in a while."" When the Whitney's curators planned the museum's first exhibitions in its new home, they postponed the biennial a year to concentrate on the permanent collection. That had an unexpected side effect. For the first time since the show's 1997 edition, biennial curators traversed the United States during a presidential election -- one rather less tranquil than the Clinton-Dole matchup. A few works here touch directly on national politics, like Ms. Dupuy-Spencer's drawings of a Trump rally, or the New Orleans reportage of the photographer An-My Le. But Mr. Lew and Ms. Locks did not rework their list of artists after Nov. 8. The election's themes were already present in the art. For Ms. Locks, ""When people keep talking about racism, when people keep talking about inequity, when people keep talking about debt -- when conversations come around without you bringing it up -- you realize: These are the ideas!"" The artists were caught ""in a moment of collective self-reflection, introspection, soul-searching,"" she added. ""And in a way, that has become part of the show."""
23616,Burning of Maya City Said to Be Act of Total Warfare,"By linking an ancient text, environmental analysis and ruins, archaeologists have documented a brutal attack.",3-D models of two stone stelae collected from an ancient Maya site in present-day Guatemala. The writing names the site as the city of Bahlam Jol.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/06/science/05SCI-MAYANS1/06MAYAN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9f21f60986d696fc99f258a4690e3cad51ca85dcb8f740e6bf7c68a7c5315bbb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/science/mayan-warfare-archaeology.html,1e8ddf80-8121-5d4f-a513-8035d4663c3d.jpg,"On May 21, 697, according to Mayan hieroglyphs, the city of Bahlam Jol ""burned for the second time."" But, like much of Mayan writing and history, the record remained mysterious to modern Maya researchers. Where was Bahlam Jol? What exactly were the Maya describing with the hieroglyph that is translated as ""burn""? There are many kinds of burning. A team of researchers that began their work with a study of lake sediments in Guatemala has found that Bahlam Jol is the Mayan name of ruins that archaeologists call Witzna in northern Guatemala, and they concluded that the fire was devastating. They reported Monday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour that the burning of Bahlam Jol was an example of total war , including ordinary city residents as targets, and not the more rule-bound conflict that focused on taking important prisoners that was thought to be the dominant form of warfare at that time in their history.

""This fire was massive,"" said David Wahl, a geographer with the United States Geological Survey and one of the authors. Dr. Wahl, who works to reconstruct the impact of humans on the climate and environment in ancient times, said that a thick layer of charcoal in sediments of a lake near the city indicated the intensity and scale of the conflagration. ""It was unlike anything I've seen in the 20 years I've been doing this."" Dr. Wahl and his colleagues argue that their findings represent a challenge to the prevailing notion of the nature of Maya warfare before 800, when more extreme violence accompanied the collapse of what is called Classic Maya civilization. Other archaeologists praised the research but said that the dominant view of Maya warfare is more complex and that there are other examples of extreme violence at different periods in Maya history.

Dr. Freidel, who specializes in Maya archaeology and was not involved in the new study, said it clearly showed that ordinary people had been targeted in the city. ""The burning of Witzna shows that total war existed,"" he said. But he noted that there had been other cases of extreme violence, including massive destruction in Tikal, during a period from 100-250. Dr. Wahl, who has done work on the ancient Maya for about 20 years, said the new research was serendipitous . He had identified a lake in Guatemala near the Witzna site that looked like a good research target. It was. In lakes, he said, the rate of sediment accumulation varies greatly, so that one centimeter (about four-tenths of an inch) of a drilled lake bed core could represent the passage of anywhere from a decade to several centuries. But in the lake near Witzna, sediment had been deposited so rapidly that a centimeter represented less than a decade, perhaps close to one year. That meant it was an extraordinarily detailed record that could be tied closely to dates and records. In the cores he drilled, he found a layer of charcoal three centimeters thick (about 1.2 inches), with chunks of charcoal almost a half inch on a side. Another author on the paper, Lysanna Anderson, a specialist in evidence of ancient fires, studied the layer. They concluded that it indicated a massive fire and had been deposited very quickly -- all at once it seemed, although some might have been from runoff a season after the burning. In addition, other chemical indications of human activity dropped off rapidly right after the event, he said, indicating that the human population itself had suddenly decreased. The fire had happened, they judged, between 690 and 700. The next piece of evidence came from Francisco Estrada-Belli, another author who is an archaeologist at Tulane University. He found widespread destruction of buildings while excavating Witzna."
11362,How Latinos Can Win the Culture War,"First, white gatekeepers have to stop hoarding power.",Arms raised in a 1970 National Chicano Moratorium Committee Against the Vietnam War march in Los Angeles.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/06/opinion/02Mendez-BerryRamirez14/02Mendez-BerryRamirez14-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=bf36679da694689d60f0ceb6e146882cbcdc99d13205be52468005245448eb2e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/opinion/sunday/latinos-trump-election.html,76856aaa-54d7-5fa8-a4e1-57bbeed7b024.jpg,"Ms. Mendez Berry is a journalist, cultural critic and editor. Ms. Ramirez is the founder of the Latinx House, and the author of the ""Dear Sisters"" letter that helped inspire the Time's Up movement.



The story about Latinos in America is an old one. And it isn't true. Created generations ago by whites to demonize Mexicans and then Puerto Ricans, the racist caricature of Latinos as a menacing foreign monolith persists, even as two-thirds of us were born here and we come from more than 20 different countries. While we are everywhere in this country, from big cities to small towns, Latinos are largely missing from American media and culture, which makes us vulnerable. President Trump knows this and exploits these fictions for political gain. Mr. Trump has accomplices. White gatekeepers in media, art and entertainment have long excluded or misrepresented Latinos, particularly Indigenous and Black Latinos, building the cultural scaffolding for the current administration. To defang these old falsehoods, we have to go after their enablers, transform media and cultural power structures and amplify and defend Latino storytellers. We must flex our power as a community. Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas gave voice to this in a recent column for Variety: ""There is a dangerous nexus between the racist political rhetoric and the negative images of Latinos as criminals and invaders that Americans see on their screens."" Mr. Castro added, ""Hollywood needs to reckon with its systemic injustice and exclusion of our communities.""

Protests by Chicano activists when Disney attempted to trademark the phrase ""Day of the Dead,"" played a major role in making the movie ""Coco"" the culturally astute blockbuster it became. Whether the goal is to shape the movie or shut it down, protests and boycotts coupled with strategic support for alternatives can work. Plenty has been written about the toxicity of narco stereotypes, and industry insiders have been organizing against them too. Latinos can learn from Color of Change, which has investigated how TV crime shows misrepresent Black people and campaigned to shut them down, resulting in the demise of the program ""Cops."" Never underestimate the power of bad publicity and people power. The facts are as important as the fictions. In the mid-19th century, when white mobs were lynching Mexicans, Spanish-language media covered those murders, leading to public protest and eventual change. Latino journalists from Ruben Salazar (killed by a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy during the Chicano Moratorium 50 years ago) to Juan Gonzalez, Roberto Lovato, Sonia Nazario, Maria Hinojosa and Tanzina Vega have played herculean roles, but their numbers are small, particularly when it comes to opinion writing.

If a U.S. media outlet today doesn't have several Latino writers, editors and columnists it should be embarrassed and it should be hiring; mastheads must be published and visible; the N.F.L'.s Rooney rule, which requires each football team to interview candidates of color from outside the organization when hiring for major jobs, should be instituted across the industry; bylines, articles, sources and salaries should be scrutinized. Just 13 percent of the Los Angeles Times newsroom is Latino in a city that is almost 50 percent Latino. As a result of organizing by the paper's union and its Latino caucus, the newspaper's owner committed to a 25 percent Latino staff in the next five years. The inventory of exclusion is long. Latinos have been shut out of prestige magazines that confer authority, awards and book deals. New York City is about 30 percent Latino -- 2.5 million stories to tell. Yet on its contributor page, The New Yorker magazine does not appear to list a single Latino; the magazine declined to confirm or deny. Because of the publication's union, some newsroom inequalities have recently been addressed. The New Yorker should tackle racial inequalities too, so that excluded groups, including Latinos, particularly nonwhite Latinos, are hired as high-level editors and writers and the magazine can credibly cover Nueva York. Funders and investors working to build Latino power must understand that information is essential community infrastructure. They should invest in independent Latino journalism like Futuro Media Group, L.A. Taco, Revista Etnica, Conecta Arizona, 80grados, Radio Ambulante and Latino Rebels instead of bankrolling perennially ""diversifying"" but never ""diverse"" organizations. The Mexican-American critic Shea Serrano's one-man media empire is a model. He created a scholarship to support emerging Latino journalists. Spanish-language journalism must be supported, too: El Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico played a pivotal role in bringing down Gov. Ricardo Rosello; imagine if we had an ace Latino investigative shop dissecting Washington. Cultural criticism, watchdog reporting and the opportunity to tell our own stories are crucial to building collective identity and confronting injustice. Imagination is essential too. When you sleep with one eye open, it's difficult to dream. That's why our art is a survival strategy. It was on abundant display in Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, a 2017 citywide series of exhibitions, funded by the Getty Foundation. Getty's support enabled La Raza newspaper and U.C.L.A.'s Chicano Studies Research Center to organize 25,000 images from its archive, offering an electrifying insider view of the 1970s Chicano power movement.

We need much more: Every major museum should commit to a similar initiative in the next three years, and museum boards and staffs, particularly curatorial teams, should look like the cities they operate in, or forfeit public and private funding. Imagine if Hollywood took a cue from Pacific Standard Time: if it made a Oaxacan blockbuster based on the Tlacolulokos murals; an Afro-Dominican futurist fantasy; a drama about the Chicano power movement; a Guatemalan buddy comedy. What if one summer all the blockbusters featured Latino stars, saving cities, planets, people, aliens? Pacific Standard Time brought Latino artists and arts organizations from the margins to the center of the Los Angeles art conversation, and demonstrated their dynamism. Let's be clear: Latinos have not been ignored because we are uninteresting.

All of these efforts are important. But the stories we tell once we have the microphone are critical. Around Latin America, the racial discourse is one of mixing Indigenous, African and European roots, but the most European-featured, light-skinned people usually end up on top, an issue that has resulted in criticism against Spanish-language channels like Univision and Telemundo by organizations like the grass-roots group Mijente. The fact that many Latinos, particularly white and light-skinned Latinos, are resistant to talking about how white privilege operates in our own communities means that they silence Indigenous and Afro-Latinos, an internal erasure that reinforces the external one. We must dismantle white supremacy in English and en espanol, and ensure that Indigenous and Black Latinos are onscreen, behind the camera and running shows and newsrooms. In order to reshape cultural power, Latinos must apply pressure from all angles. They should challenge advertisers, a tactic Presente.org and others used to get the anti-Latino Lou Dobbs off CNN. Shareholder activism is another option: by holding at least $2,000 in a public company's stock, one can submit a shareholder proposal expressing concerns about a company's practices for its investors to vote on. This could mean investing in media and entertainment companies in order to challenge problematic practices or partnering with investor networks like the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility to shape their priorities around racial justice. For too long, Latinos have been shut out by the corporations that decide how we are portrayed; shareholder strategies have a record of making companies uncomfortable and setting off change. What if we weren't perceived as casualties of culture but as its owners?

We are the second-largest ethnic group in this country. Many of us were here before the ancestors of most people who call themselves Americans. Others came as casualties of U.S. colonial experiments, covert operations and trade deals. No matter how we got here or when, this country should be grateful for the Latino community: During this pandemic, farmworkers, 80 percent of whom are Latino, have put food on the table for us all, and scores of other Latino workers have propped this country up, often at great cost to themselves. The United States must reckon with the fact that Latinos are essential to its survival and to its splendor, and have been for generations. We Latinos need to know it, too.

This time, it's the Tour de France. The Tour had thus far avoided postponing, but organizers said on Tuesday that the race could not start on time in Nice on June 27 after President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that public events would be banned through the middle of July. The Tour was scheduled to run for three weeks and end on the Champs-Elysees on July 19. This year's race was to be heavy on climbing, including a visit to the top of the Grand Colombier in the Alps, and light on time trials. Tour organizers are no doubt hoping for only a brief delay. The schedule immediately after the Tour has opened up some because of the postponement of the Olympics, where the cycling road race was to have been held July 25, about a week after the Tour ended.

But if the Tour is delayed much longer, it could bump into the Vuelta a Espana, scheduled for Aug. 14 to Sept. 6, and the world championships, at the end of September. The first of the three grand tours, the Giro d'Italia, has already been postponed from May and is also looking for a new date. With each Tour normally filling three weeks, the calendar is tight. Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour, expressed confidence in March that the race would go on, saying, ""Only two world wars were able to stop the Tour de France."" Covid-19 has now done the same. Tuesday's sports schedule included three soccer games, all friendlies in Sweden, a dozen hockey games in Russia and ... more than 250 table tennis matches. Maybe it's the social distancing between players that the table provides. Maybe it's ... well, that's all we can think of. But in any case, Russia, Ukraine and the Czech Republic are packing in table tennis matches, running them virtually all day long. Perhaps some Eastern European Ping-Pong enthusiasts are excited about these games, but they could hardly be crossing over to mainstream sports fans. Or could they?

At least one group of fans is following table tennis avidly: Of course, that's gamblers. ""Table tennis is the No. 1 draw by a country mile,"" the William Hill sportsbook director, Nick Bogdanovich, told The Las Vegas Review Journal. ""There's 90 matches a day, so it adds up."" A Review Journal reporter stayed up late betting the action and actually made a few bucks. His secret: Take the underdog. New on the abbreviated world sports schedule on Tuesday, for some reason, was badminton from Armenia. Burundi has stuck out as one of the few countries in the world, and the only one in Africa, to continue with soccer. It too has now halted play. Curiously, the stated reason had nothing to do with the coronavirus. The president of the soccer federation said it was because stadiums would be needed for election rallies. Formula One continues to rip the Band-Aid off slowly rather than all at once, canceling its races one by one. The latest to go is the French Grand Prix on June 28. That's 10 races that have been canceled or postponed indefinitely; 12 remain on the schedule for now. You know India is taking the coronavirus seriously. Not because the lockdown of more than a billion people has been extended to May 3, but because the Indian Premier League, the enormously popular cricket competition, has been postponed indefinitely. Field hockey, another popular sport in India, has also been shut down."
7970,New Boss May Test Voice of America's Credibility,Over 280 million people a week depend on the V.O.A. for news.

The concept was the opposite: A federally funded broadcaster would showcase American values around the world by offering unbiased news and a true picture of American life. That mission is enshrined in what the V.O.A. calls its ""firewall,"" which ""prohibits interference by any U.S. government official in the objective, independent reporting of news.""

So it's worrisome that the Senate confirmation of the Trump administration's pick to head the V.O.A. and several allied broadcasters was followed by the resignations of the two top V.O.A. executives, both experienced, respected and independent journalists.

The people who listen to the news service around the world -- more than 280 million in 40 languages and on every media platform -- are, for the most part, people who can't abide the propaganda of their rulers and turn to the world's premier democracy to hear the truth. If they thought V.O.A. was also feeding them propaganda, they'd change the station, and probably their image of the United States.

The value of such journalism should be self-evident to any believer in the value of a free press. It is not to President Trump nor to his erstwhile strategist Stephen K. Bannon. It was Mr. Bannon, then head of the far-right website Breitbart, who more than two years ago tried to put his man, Michael Pack, at the helm of V.O.A. But the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, first under Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and Trump critic, and then under the more Trump-friendly Jim Risch of Idaho, was in no rush to confirm Mr. Pack until something prodded Mr. Trump to launch an attack on V.O.A. two months ago."

About 20 percent of shows in the 2017-18 season on Broadway and Off Broadway stages were created by people of color, the report found. Nearly two-thirds of roles were filled by white actors on Broadway, and about 94 percent of directors were white.

The study examined the city's 18 largest nonprofit theaters, as well as all 41 Broadway stages. It is a snapshot of a single season, and varies each time it is done. In the seasons since 2017-18, several shows with casts that feature a high percentage of performers of color -- including the musicals ""Ain't Too Proud,"" ""Tina,"" ""Hadestown"" and ""West Side Story,"" as well as ""Slave Play"" and ""A Soldier's Play"" -- have been staged on Broadway.

The study found that Off Broadway theaters invested as much as six times as much in white actors as they did in actors of color. It noted that a similar gap likely exists on Broadway stages, but it could not say for certain because Broadway theaters do not publish their negotiated salaries."

Initial claims declined to a new low from the stratospheric multimillion levels reached in the spring, but they remained above records set in previous recessions. While there is a ""gradual healing of the labor market,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton, the number of laid-off and furloughed workers collecting some form of unemployment insurance is still staggeringly high. A total of 723,000 workers filed new claims for state benefits, the Labor Department reported Thursday. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the figure was 709,000.

Another 298,000 new claims were filed under a federal emergency program, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, designed for freelancers, part-time workers and others who are not normally eligible for state benefits. ""Technically it looks like we're in a recovery,"" Ms. Swonk said, ""but we're still so much in the hole."" Prospects for digging out of that hole are shadowed by the alarming rise in Covid-19 caseloads around the country. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. And many people already collecting unemployment insurance have been hitting the 26-week limit on benefits that exists in most states. Those workers are eligible for an additional 13 weeks of benefits under a federal program called Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, though the transfer from one program to the other is not automatic in some states.

The number of filings in this program increased to 4.14 million for the week ending Oct. 24, from 3.98 million the previous week, according to the latest data available. ""That's where you see the wounds festering and worry about how deep they are and how much they'll scar us,"" Ms. Swonk said. Most economists agree that controlling the pandemic is a prerequisite for an economic recovery regardless of any government-ordered shutdowns. News of the development of a vaccine that is 90 percent effective lifted hopes -- and markets -- this week. But Mary C. Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said on Tuesday, ""The economy right now is being dictated by coronavirus's existence, and I think less by the potential for a vaccine."" Several Fed officials, including the chair, Jerome H. Powell, have said Congress's failure to agree on another relief package for individuals and business will hamper any recovery. Both federal pandemic-related jobless programs will expire at the end of the year without further action. With the coronavirus pandemic entering its ninth month, economists warn that the prolonged downturn could inflict long-lasting wounds to U.S. employment. ""There's a risk that we're going to see permanent damage to the labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. She was referring to laid-off workers who end up dropping out of the work force and to industries like restaurants, entertainment, travel and hospitality that are unable to return to full capacity. Roughly one-third of unemployed workers have been without a job for 27 weeks or more, compared with 4.1 percent in April. The longer someone is unemployed, the harder it is to get back into the work force.

Job losses that aren't reflected in the unemployment figures also exact a toll. Cindy Fraser used to work three jobs: as a church custodian in Redford, Mich.; as a house cleaner; and as a florist specializing in weddings and special events. Understand Inflation and How It Affects You

She held on to her custodial job, working about 25 hours a week at $10 an hour. But she has struggled to keep up with her monthly bills, including a $650 mortgage payment, a $350 car payment, $150 for car insurance and $300 for utilities. She applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the federal program, but was told she did not qualify. Ms. Fraser, 54, is a single mother of four children and lives with her two younger daughters, 15 and 16, one of whom has a genetic condition and several autoimmune disorders that make her vulnerable to the coronavirus. Ms. Fraser has to be selective about taking additional work because she worries about exposure to the virus in a store or a restaurant. ""I can't get sick, because if either one of my daughters gets sick, I am the only parent to take care of them,"" she said. ""So I have to be extremely choosy as to what kind of jobs I can take so I don't bring the virus into my home. I can't just go get a job at Walmart.""

She is talking about both the antiseptic-looking hotel room she is tidying and the country, Switzerland, in which it is located.

Certainly, no one looking at the crisply anonymous set for Amelia Roper's ""Zurich,"" which opened on Monday night at Next Door at NYTW, would argue with that description. But don't assume that the standards of moral hygiene are anywhere near as high for those who inhabit this dark, teasingly contrived comedy.

The 10 characters in ""Zurich,"" directed by Adrienne Campbell-Holt in a polished Colt Coeur production, are human beings of the 21st century. They are, at best, a mess and, at worst, moral cesspools, polluted by greed, lust for power, political corruption and a system built on what one character refers to as ""toxic masculinity.""

Described in the program as ""an Australian-American writer and activist,"" Ms. Roper lends a bracingly astringent perspective to life as we know it today. Even the children who scamper through her play -- which takes place in a series of interchangeable rooms on the 40th floor of a luxury hotel -- seem somehow tainted, as if born into the latter-day equivalent of original sin."
26589,"Claire Foy and Matt Smith Meet Again, Onstage","The stars of ""The Crown"" are back together in a production in London.","Matt Smith and Claire Foy in Duncan Macmillan's ""Lungs,"" directed by Matthew Warchus, at the Old Vic.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/07/arts/07londontheater01/07londontheater01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=544464679ffa84e41bc0464c9622fc355c0eff19fbfa89c8266812867e349d80&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/theater/lungs-old-vic-claire-foy-matt-smith.html,bec802c7-43af-5814-832c-0d4b66e917d4.jpg,"LONDON -- As proof that you can't keep a good couple down, along comes ""Lungs"" at the Old Vic Theater to put center stage a screen pairing whose wattage shines even more brightly when experienced live. Claire Foy and Matt Smith came to attention together as the young royals of the blockbuster TV series ""The Crown."" Their current stage assignment, smartly directed by Matthew Warchus and on view through Nov. 9, finds them in distinctly unregal street clothes, in a 90-minute two-hander from Duncan Macmillan that was first seen in 2011. Their characters, far from being known the world over, aren't even named. Playing an impassioned young couple whom we follow through decisive moments in their lives (some joyful, others not), the pair lend shape and dimension to a work that might seem piecemeal in lesser hands. Foy has the grabbier role as one of those talkative folks who can't experience a feeling without placing it under a microscope for examination; Smith is a comparatively relaxed, reflective presence, without whom Foy would have no sounding board. Foy has scarcely opened her mouth before she is pondering the prospect of parenthood in a grim world in which ""thoughtless people are multiplying like rats."" The discussion ricochets this way and that to encompass matters of fidelity and evil, career options and the couple's own parents, before moving jaggedly forward in time to a poignant conclusion.

Words spilling out of her, Foy sustains a daunting level of energy while maintaining sympathy for this often-tearful woman and her exposed nerve ends; Smith, as a musician who goes corporate, offers a study in patience, but never saintly. (Far from it, in fact, as we discover.) During the curtain call, the two dance together in a shared adrenaline rush that speaks to the delight they clearly take in each other's company. Let's have more of them, please, in whatever medium they choose.

Even as ""Lungs"" leaves you to ponder where its irresistible cast might join forces again, a veteran actor has returned to the stage to remind audiences of his lifelong commitment to the theater : the medium where this two-time Oscar nominee began his career and to which he regularly returns. I'm referring, of course, to Ian McKellen, who turned 80 this year and, on the evidence of ""Ian McKellen on Stage,"" will be with us for a while yet. This one-man show, at the Harold Pinter Theater through Jan. 5, finds the actor busily recapping for the better part of three hours the personal and professional journey that has led to his current renown, with career-making turns in ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""X-Men"" film franchises and with two films, ""The Good Liar"" and ""Cats,"" opening any minute now. He starts by directly invoking his screen incarnation of J.R.R. Tolkien's Gandalf, signature sword at the ready, saving the heavier lifting required by Shakespeare until after the intermission. His ever-expanding list of credits would mean nothing, he makes clear, without his work as a gay activist, and McKellen is at his most affecting charting the kind of personal growth for which you don't win trophies.

Directed by his onetime partner and longtime friend, Sean Mathias, McKellen is a jolly raconteur who engages as readily with the audience as he does with Shakespeare . Calling on the audience to help by calling out titles, he makes a point of meticulously name-checking every Shakespeare play, some more valued than others. (He's not a great fan, evidently, of ""Troilus and Cressida."") This London engagement was preceded by a tour of Britain, proceeds from which went entirely to charity, and McKellen took advantage of a recent trip to New York to perform the show for one night only on Broadway. The result feels like a gesture of giving back, one that fires up the performer from within. After a recent matinee, McKellen could be seen rattling a bucket in the theater foyer for further donations from the audience, whom he clearly loved. Such affection, you feel, is more than reciprocated.

An entertainer's rapport with the public can be transgressed, though: That is the topic of the actor-comedian Richard Gadd's startling self-penned solo play, ""Baby Reindeer,"" at the Bush Theater through Nov. 9. Directed by Jon Brittain with a hurtling ferocity, the play, which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe this summer, chronicles the real-life takeover of Gadd's daily existence by a stalker whom the Scottish performer names only as ""Martha."" By the end of an uninterrupted 70 minutes, you may feel as if this (unseen) source of more than 40,000 emails and 350 hours of voicemail has chipped away at your well-being as well. Gadd artfully widens his focus to include a level of self-inquiry that must be difficult to perform: ""Martha's"" gradual takeover of his life has an effect on his own relationships that leaves him wondering where he can turn for comfort. The police are less than helpful, accepting this predator's view of her actions as ""knockabout fun"" and even suggesting, at one point, that Gadd apologize to her. And though Gadd has a restraining order against ""Martha,"" he voices the possibility that his tormentor may be sitting among us. In which case, you could forgive playgoers for looking a touch fretful as they left. I'm sure I wasn't alone in wishing this magnetic performer a safe journey home. Lungs.

58561,Job Growth Eases Fears About Effect of Closing,"Robust job creation in October — 204,000 positions — prompted some usually cautious observers to wonder whether the economy was finally finding its footing.","An internship fair at Marlins Park in Miami in October. The Labor Department said the economy added 204,000 jobs last month.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/09/business/Jobs/Jobs-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=431&w=600&s=0637f31270c1092f5b795bd84bf074438950416c182e5e1083e86a3cc6479d63&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/business/economy/us-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-3-204000-jobs-added.html,b08f673c-4924-5add-b28b-b0c01d2ee1fc.jpg,"Despite dysfunction in Washington and a 16-day government shutdown, the economy chugged along in October, surprising many analysts as private sector hiring bounced back after a spring slowdown. The latest figures, along with upward revisions for job creation in August and September released by the Labor Department on Friday, lifted the estimated monthly pace of hiring to 202,000 over the last three months. If that strength persists, the Federal Reserve will probably feel comfortable enough to begin easing back on its stimulus efforts, economists said, though probably not as early as its next meeting in December. Over all, experts said the new data showed an economy with more underlying strength than first thought, but not necessarily growing as fast as many policy makers would like. ""Sometimes it's a little faster, sometimes it's a little slower,"" said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. ""The labor market is in decent shape, but it's not doing that much better than six months or a year ago.""

Still, the addition of 204,000 nonfarm jobs in October eased fears about the impact of the shutdown and prompted some usually cautious observers to wonder whether the economy was finally finding its footing after four years of on-again, off-again growth. ""Maybe this is the beginning of that long-awaited period of better growth for the economy,"" said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""October was remarkably resilient."" Although strong economic reports -- by raising expectations of a quicker move by the Fed to rein in its extra stimulus -- have sometimes spooked markets in the past, stocks surged on Friday as traders bet healthier growth and rising earnings would offset any damping effect caused by any Fed retreat. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. Some market veterans, however, recommended keeping the champagne on ice. ""It's not a watershed yet,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ""A few more months like this could make it a watershed. We need at least another month of good data and some confidence in fiscal policy for the Fed to pull the trigger in December."" A separate question from the timing of the Fed tapering, which affects longer-term interest rates for loans like mortgages, is when the central bank will begin raising short-term interest rates from their current rock-bottom levels.

The Fed has signaled that will not happen before unemployment falls to 6.5 percent, suggesting no move until at least 2015. But now experts like Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs say they think policy makers will decrease that threshold to 6 percent or perhaps even lower. As a result, Mr. Hatzius said he expected the Fed would hold off on raising short-term rates from near zero until early 2016. The payroll data come from a monthly survey of employers, and the Labor Department said on Friday that there were ""no discernible impacts of the partial federal government shutdown"" on these figures, which came out a week behind schedule. If anything, analysts said, the delay in conducting the survey could have added to the numbers. But the unemployment rate, based on a separate survey of households that counted furloughed federal employees as out of work, rose to 7.3 percent in October from 7.2 percent in September.

One mystery buried in Friday's report was a drop of 720,000 in the size of the labor force, and the ensuing fall in the labor participation rate to 62.8 percent, a 35-year low. The labor participation rate has been falling in recent years as discouraged workers have dropped out of the work force, others have decided to stay in school or stay home to take care of children, and the number of retirements by baby boomers has picked up. But the drop in October was the biggest one-month decline since the end of 2009. A smaller labor force has the effect of making the overall unemployment rate appear lower, but is a troubling sign for the long-term health of the economy. ""We're scratching our heads,"" said Mr. Berger. ""You have to set this aside and look at the November report. Does it reverse? Does it keep declining? To us, it's puzzling."" Understand Inflation and How It Affects You

Now, it's going to affect the size of your paycheck next year The economy's ability to seemingly shake off the effects of last month's showdown in Washington left both parties trying to spin the numbers in a way that favored their side.

The White House stuck to its guns, with Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, asserting ""there should be no debate that the shutdown and debt limit brinkmanship inflicted unnecessary damage on the economy in October."" Thomas Perez, the labor secretary, said in an interview that while the jobs gain was encouraging, ""I'm confident we would have had more but for the shutdown."" Representative Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, had a very different take. ""When the government simply gets out of the way of the private sector, we can see real job growth,"" he said in a statement. Mr. Brady said the real message in Friday's report was the big decline in the participation rate, ""as too many workers have dropped out because they lost hope."" Employment still has a long way to go before returning to its prerecession level, in part because the downturn was so severe and because job gains in this recovery have come more slowly than in past recoveries. Compared to when the downturn began in December 2007, the number of jobs is still about 1.5 million below that peak, a decline of about 1.1 percent. And that does not account for the fact that the working-age population has continued to grow, meaning that if the economy were healthy, there should be considerably more jobs today than there were before the recession. Sharp disparities remain evident in the jobs figures. Unemployment for workers over 25 with less than a high school diploma rose to 10.9 percent in October from 10.3 percent in September, while joblessness among college-educated Americans inched up to a modest 3.8 percent from 3.7 percent in the previous month. Similarly, the participation rate for the most educated workers stood at 75 percent, compared with 44.7 percent for the least educated ones. Average hourly earnings in October rose just 0.1 percent, but over the last year they are up 2.2 percent. That's far less than most workers would like, but with inflation very low, it does suggest some improvement in terms of spending power by consumers. The bump in job creation for October has many economists and traders already looking ahead to the jobs report for this month, due out Dec. 6, for guidance on whether the stronger gains are sustainable or if the numbers were influenced by any statistical quirks. Mr. Hatzius, echoing a widespread view of the report, summed it up this way: ""2014 is going to be a stronger year for growth but I wouldn't use this report as confirmation of that. There is a lot of noise in there."""

An Investigation

By Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly Nearly a year after the fateful Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh have become martyrs in separate and hostile galaxies -- one for #believeallwomen and the other for those who believe Democrats will use any means necessary to take down good and honorable men. So there is a weird satisfaction in rewinding the story more than 30 years, back to the moment when the two lived in suburban Maryland and coexisted as part of a small social circle of teenagers who hung out at country club pools all summer and whose pressing concern was which parents were out of town for the weekend. ""The Education of Brett Kavanaugh,"" by Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, two experienced New York Times reporters who helped cover the confirmation hearings, comes with an expectation of bombshells (the galleys are stamped ""EMBARGOED"" on every page). And the authors do in fact turn up a few new revelations about the assault accusations against Kavanaugh. But their real work is to smooth out the main story, create a fuller picture of Kavanaugh himself, place him in relation to Blasey Ford and put the minor players in motion, so that the confirmation showdown has a kind of cinematic inevitability.

The book places Blasey Ford in the summer of 1982, when, she later said, Kavanaugh tried to rape her. A rising junior at Holton-Arms school, a tall cheerleader with feathered bangs and saddle shoes, she spent her days with friends at the Columbia Country Club pool exchanging the early '80s equivalent of the eye-roll emoji (""mange-moi"" and ""Kill Dick""). Kavanaugh, as we know from his infamously meticulous calendar, spent his time mowing lawns and figuring out which of his Georgetown Prep friends was ""popping,"" the technical term for holding a party when your parents were out of town.

For most of the book the writers take an omniscient Woodwardian tone, staying careful and balanced and not cluttering up every sentence with newspaper-style sourcing. But I couldn't help reading a lot into the title. On my own copy I idly scribbled ""Mis"" before the ""Education,"" since it's clear that academic enrichment is not what the authors have in mind. In high school and college and even a little into law school, the main thing they portray Kavanaugh learning is how to expertly blend into the background hum of blase misogyny and clubby competitive drinking. The picture that emerges of Kavanaugh as an actual student is admirable if indistinct. He works hard, graduates near or at the top in his class. A college friend recalls him having a neat stack of books and papers he would move through like a machine. A couple of people remember him as special but just as many remember him as ""straightforward and uncomplicated"" -- or, as some college friends put it, ""ham on white."" My favorite observation about his college years is: ""Along with playing and writing about sports, Kavanaugh enjoyed watching them in his downtime."" Really, that could be anyone. In fact, when he got his big break as a clerk for Judge Alex Kozinski, the law professor who recommended him described him as a ""good student"" and not a ""great one,"" but added, ""I got to know his character from basketball.""

Where Kavanaugh jumps off the page is in what might euphemistically be called ""extracurriculars."" He went to high school with classmates who had private pools and tennis courts and sometimes even private jets. He came of age during the era of ""Porky's"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" That combination of extreme privilege and extreme license, which he seemed to take for granted as a teenager, in retrospect looks lethal. He lived in the athlete bubble and made fun of kids outside it. He was not known as a starter of trouble but as a joiner, signing on to the ""100 Keg Club,"" riding in the Party Van, singing obnoxious songs about who was a good lay. His friends ran an underground paper called The Unknown Hoya, dispensing helpful tips such as ""all it takes to have a good time with any H.H. (Holton Hosebag)"" is a Montgomery County library card. People who knew Kavanaugh said he was nice and well mannered except when he was drinking or hanging out with his friends and showed his ""cocky dismissive side."" In his confirmation hearings Kavanaugh bristled at his drinking being characterized as anything other than perfectly normal. And maybe it was perfectly normal by the standards of upper-middle-class white teenagers in the '80s, but the norm is sometimes worth examining. In Kavanaugh's case, it encouraged years of proud obnoxious partying, belligerent public behavior and a smugness about being above the rules. As he told a group of students in 2014 recounting his law school years, they had a motto: ""What happens on the bus stays on the bus.""

Pogrebin and Kelly spend significant time digging into Blasey Ford's accusations and also those of Deborah Ramirez, a woman who says Kavanaugh put his penis in her face at a Yale college party. They track down any witnesses and friends willing to talk, comb through legal documents, do their best to find the house where Blasey Ford says the assault took place. They point out critical witnesses that the F.B.I., in its very limited investigation, did not have time to interview. In the end they turn up no smoking gun, no secret confession, no friend who comes forth to say Kavanaugh was lying all this time.

What they do instead is almost too cruel: use his mother's words against him. In an extremely satisfying epilogue, Pogrebin and Kelly invoke as a guide something Martha Kavanaugh, who was a state prosecutor, would often say at the dinner table: ""Use your common sense. What rings true? What rings false?"" With this standard they come to a generous but also damning conclusion, which is that Blasey Ford and Ramirez are believable and were in fact mistreated by Kavanaugh as teenagers, but that over the next 35 years he became a better person. No woman has come forward to say Kavanaugh assaulted her after law school (though an unidentified woman has claimed that in 1998 her daughter witnessed him ""very aggressively and sexually"" push a friend of the daughter's whom Kavanaugh was allegedly dating at the time). Many women have said he was a generous mentor and boss. Over half his clerks were women, something he set his mind to after reading a story about the sudden drop in female law clerks. And here and there, Kavanaugh has made decisions that support feminist causes. He has two daughters, and he coaches their teams. The conclusion Pogrebin and Kelly come to about Kavanaugh is therefore pretty narrow. He was a teenager whose heavy drinking may have led to a bad memory. That's the working theory.

The Garden State Parkway and other highways that are crossing over the Raritan River are visible in the back.



SAYREVILLE, N.J. -- A bleak expanse of coastal New Jersey, polluted by paint pigments and abandoned for decades, is undergoing a makeover that will bring a major development of housing, retail space and office space a half-hour's drive from Lower Manhattan. In coming weeks, the O'Neill Properties Group will officially break ground on the 5.8 million-square-foot project, The Pointe. The 418-acre site, south of Staten Island, is at the heart of a highway network that already carries some 400,000 vehicles a day directly past the site, and on summer weekends, hundreds of thousands more. The groundbreaking will make way for the anchor retail tenant, Bass Pro Shops, to build a 200,000-square-foot store. The store is expected to open in June 2017 as the first stage of a planned 2.4 million square feet of retail space. The developer has also agreed with Regal Cinemas to build a 55,000-square-foot movie theater complex, and is in talks with about 20 other potential retail tenants.

Over the next seven to 10 years, the development is to add 750,000 square feet of office space, up to 1,000 hotel rooms, and 2,000 apartments overlooking the Raritan River. By mid-2017, the complex is to have its own highway interchange, which will provide 12 on- and off-ramps for the adjacent Garden State Parkway and U.S. 9 and Route 35 nearby. Together, these highways carry some 600,000 people a day to and from jobs in New York City or to Jersey Shore towns to the south, according to data from the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the state's Department of Transportation and Maser Consulting, an engineering firm working on the project. The high volume of traffic, and the accessibility of the new development to the major Northeast market, represent an unusual opportunity for potential tenants, said the developer's chief executive, Brian O'Neill Sr. ""One hundred percent of New Jersey shore visitors pass through this intersection if they are coming from the five boroughs of New York City, northern New Jersey and southern Connecticut,"" Mr. O'Neill said, in an interview in a trailer on the edge of the site. ""In summertime, there are days when there are a million cars, or two or three million people, coming through this intersection,"" he said, ""which makes for one of the most spectacular opportunities for retailers to expose themselves to their clientele.""

The project is a joint venture of O'Neill Properties and Prudential Real Estate Investors, and is expected to cost at least $2.2 billion by the time it is finished, Mr. O'Neill said. The interchange is being constructed at a cost of $85 million, $15 million of which is being paid by the developer and the remainder by the state. New Jersey, America's most densely populated state, has long sought to redevelop its so-called brownfield sites, abandoned and often contaminated tracts formerly used for commercial or industrial purposes. O'Neill Properties, based in King of Prussia, Pa., specializes in brownfield redevelopment. O'Neill bought the Sayreville site for $80 million in 2008, some two decades after it was abandoned by NL Industries, formerly National Lead, which had manufactured paint pigment there since 1934. In early 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency directed the company to pay $79 million to clean up a 40-acre lagoon on the east side of the site, where Bass Pro Shops will build its new store. NL Industries was found to be at least partly responsible for contamination there, which included PCBs, titanium dioxide and technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material. This required a multiyear environmental remediation project costing $45 million, and involving the removal or treatment of 360,000 cubic yards of soil. Cleaning up the lagoon turned out to be far more challenging than the company expected when it bought the property, said Brian O'Neill Jr., Mr. O'Neill's son, who manages the Sayreville project.

The solution was to inject 38,000 tons of portland cement into hundreds of cells in the lagoon, an operation that took a year and a half and has now created a stable site where Bass Pro Shops can build. Remediation on other parts of the site is continuing, and some environmental permits are still pending, Mr. O'Neill Jr. said. Before O'Neill Properties purchased the site, it was the subject of a number of lawsuits between NL Industries, Sayreville's economic development agency and the state Department of Environmental Protection, all of which were resolved by the purchase, Mr. O'Neill Jr. said. NL Industries did not respond to requests for comment. The company says that the costly and time-consuming process of reclaiming the site from its toxic history is justified by the unique opportunity to own such a large parcel of developable land in the midst of one of the country's biggest markets. ""The real estate fundamentals of this site are unparalleled,"" Mr. O'Neill Jr. said, noting that the waterfront property promised to be an additional attraction for future residents. Matt S. Krauser, senior managing director in northern New Jersey for Integra Realty Resources, a national valuation company, agreed that the availability and development of a big parcel in a prime location were rare and promising. ""To be able to acquire 400 acres right off the parkway with ease of accessibility both north and south, it's really an unusual project in an unusual location,"" he said. ""It's more or less a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be able to construct something like this."" He said that the project was a departure from the town center type of development that had dominated in recent years. With its office and residential components, the Sayreville project could be seen as a hybrid, he said.

""It's building its own downtown in the suburbs,"" Mr. Krauser said. When the project is complete, Mr. O'Neill Sr. said, 221 million people annually will drive by four digital billboards measuring up to 44,000 square feet. Each will dwarf the one on the side of the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square, which was one of the largest in the world when it was installed in 2014. Combined with seven digital media towers, also alongside the Garden State Parkway, the development will create 226,000 square feet of digital signage, all of which has been approved by state and local authorities, the developer said. The signs represent a major opportunity for advertisers to reach millions of people at a lower cost than other forms of mass advertising, Mr. O'Neill Sr. said. And millions of customers riding along the parkway, he added, ""can't block it out."" The new development was welcomed by Kennedy O'Brien, Sayreville's mayor, who said the borough's officials approved it because it was a mixed-use project with a residential element. That offers Sayreville the prospect of reviving its depressed center, he said, which was built more than 100 years ago and has scarce parking and very little economic opportunity. ""It's not a gathering place for the people of Sayreville anymore,"" Mr. O'Brien said, in contrast to the new development, which he called ""a natural evolution for a town like ours."" Sayreville, which formerly made bricks for the construction of Manhattan and munitions for World War I, is a middle-income community of some 43,000 people where homeownership is high, foreclosures are low and church attendance is widespread, Mr. O'Brien said. ""It's a Norman Rockwell American town,"" he said. Mr. O'Brien added that the development would be a good source of new tax revenue to bolster the local economy. ""This will provide a great injection of extra money into our tax base,"" Mr. O'Brien said. ""It will provide employment opportunities, and Bass Pro Shops will provide a great place for husbands to go when their wives go shopping."""

The home includes the bottom three levels of a five-level house: a basement level, garden level and first floor. The two floors above contain apartments with separate entrances and are not included in the sale. Built in 1901 and renovated in 2000, the home has a private yard in the back and another in the front that extends to the street, a rarity in Amsterdam, where homes are typically flush with the sidewalk or have minimal yards, said the owner, Samantha Destree. ""A front garden is an anomaly -- very, very rare,"" she said. The front door opens to a long, tiled hall that stretches to the back of the house. On the left are the living and dining rooms; on the right are a half bathroom and a staircase leading down to the basement and up to the second floor.

The kitchen is in the rear of the house, attached to a sunny breakfast room with built-in shelving. Large glass doors open to a broad terrace with seating areas and, beyond, to the back garden. The kitchen has red cabinetry and a Belgian stone counter that is open to the breakfast area. On the second floor, the master bedroom has wide-plank floors, a wall of windows and a balcony overlooking the back garden. An adjacent second bedroom has been used as an office, and a third is at the stair landing. The upstairs bedrooms share a hall toilet and a separate room with a shower, tub and twin sinks. The basement level has three bedrooms, two storage rooms and a shower room. One room could be converted into a full bathroom, Ms. Destree said. The Weesperzijde neighborhood, about a mile south of Amsterdam's center, is home to ""a mix of young, hip professionals and families,"" she said, as well as shops, cafes and schools. The venerated De Hoop rowing club is down the street, on the riverfront.

Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands and the country's largest city, with about 875,000 residents. It has seen increasing home prices in recent years, although the growth slowed a bit in 2019. Data collected by Statistics Netherlands, the government's national statistics agency, showed that the average home sale price in 2019 was 484,995 euros ($535,000), a 5 percent increase over 2018, following increases of about 13 percent year-over-year in 2017 and 2018. Amsterdam is also the country's most expensive city, according to a 2019 report by Dutch Rabobank, which found that the average sale price there in the second quarter of the year was 25 percent higher than in Utrecht and 67 percent higher than in Rotterdam, the second-largest city. Kees Kemp, an agent-owner at the local Broersma Estate Agency, described Amsterdam as ""booming"" and ""very international,"" in an email. ""The demand is very high, as the number of citizens is rising fast,"" he wrote. With development struggling to keep pace, ""the market in Amsterdam is under pressure,"" said Tjerk van der Linden, a managing director of Engel & Volkers Amsterdam. Among other factors, Mr. van der Linden and other agents pointed to the arrival of foreign companies that have moved their headquarters to Amsterdam because of concerns related to the Brexit referendum in Britain. The influx of foreign businesses and buyers has some calling the Dutch capital the new London, although Pieter Joep van den Brink, the founder and broker of Vandenbrink, the Christie's affiliate in Amsterdam, said the comparison is not entirely apt. Amsterdam may be vying to become Europe's next financial center, he said, but the real estate market is behaving differently than London's because people are primarily buying to homes to live in, rather than as investments.

""The result is that the old and less popular neighborhoods of Amsterdam are becoming more and more expensive,"" said Jim Reerink, the owner of Netherlands Sotheby's International Realty. ""There is a clear increase in single-person households and student accommodation. Also in the luxury segment there is a shift to even more luxury through concierge and other service facilities."" Homes priced below 1 million euros ($1.1 million) sell fast, Mr. Kemp said, often in a matter of weeks and at up to 60 or 70 percent above asking price. There is some new development in the city. High-rise developments have gone up in the Amsterdam North and Amstelkwartier neighborhoods, Mr. Kemp said, and IJburg, a series of man-made islands along the northeastern waterfront, promises thousands of new homes. The city center, with its canals and bridges, remains popular, but ""we see an increasing number of buyers who find the center too busy and touristy,"" Mr. van der Linden said, pointing to limited parking and scarce affordable housing. Instead, buyers are moving farther afield -- into the Zuidas business district, for example, which has evolved into a neighborhood ""with many international people,"" Mr. van der Linden said. Buyers are also discovering areas outside the city, including Haarlem, Heemstede, Amstelveen and The Hague."
38646,"In Screening for Suicide Risk, Facebook Takes On Tricky Public Health Role","Some doctors warn that Facebook is becoming an arbiter of users' mental distress without proving that its efforts are accurate, effective or safe.","Facebook called Courtney Davis, left, a telecommunications operator at the Police Department in Rock Hill, S.C., about a man who was live-streaming a suicide attempt, helping Sgt.

Earlier that day, a local woman wrote a Facebook post saying she was walking home and intended to kill herself when she got there, according to a police report on the case. Facebook called to warn the Police Department about the suicide threat. The officer who took the call quickly located the woman, but she denied having suicidal thoughts, the police report said. Even so, the officer believed she might harm herself and told the woman that she must go to a hospital -- either voluntarily or in police custody. He ultimately drove her to a hospital for a mental health work-up, an evaluation prompted by Facebook's intervention. (The New York Times withheld some details of the case for privacy reasons.) Police stations from Massachusetts to Mumbai have received similar alerts from Facebook over the last 18 months as part of what is most likely the world's largest suicide threat screening and alert program. The social network ramped up the effort after several people live-streamed their suicides on Facebook Live in early 2017. It now utilizes both algorithms and user reports to flag possible suicide threats. Facebook's rise as a global arbiter of mental distress puts the social network in a tricky position at a time when it is under investigation for privacy lapses by regulators in the United States, Canada and the European Union -- as well as facing heightened scrutiny for failing to respond quickly to election interference and ethnic hatred campaigns on its site. Even as Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has apologized for improper harvesting of user data, the company grappled last month with fresh revelations about special data-sharing deals with tech companies.

The anti-suicide campaign gives Facebook an opportunity to frame its work as a good news story. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among people ages 15 to 29 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Some mental health experts and police officials said Facebook had aided officers in locating and stopping people who were clearly about to harm themselves. Facebook has computer algorithms that scan the posts, comments and videos of users in the United States and other countries for indications of immediate suicide risk. When a post is flagged, by the technology or a concerned user, it moves to human reviewers at the company, who are empowered to call local law enforcement. ""In the last year, we've helped first responders quickly reach around 3,500 people globally who needed help,"" Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a November post about the efforts. But other mental health experts said Facebook's calls to the police could also cause harm -- such as unintentionally precipitating suicide, compelling nonsuicidal people to undergo psychiatric evaluations, or prompting arrests or shootings.

And, they said, it is unclear whether the company's approach is accurate, effective or safe. Facebook said that, for privacy reasons, it did not track the outcomes of its calls to the police. And it has not disclosed exactly how its reviewers decide whether to call emergency responders. Facebook, critics said, has assumed the authority of a public health agency while protecting its process as if it were a corporate secret.

""It's hard to know what Facebook is actually picking up on, what they are actually acting on, and are they giving the appropriate response to the appropriate risk,"" said Dr. John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. ""It's black box medicine."" Facebook said it worked with suicide prevention experts to develop a comprehensive program to quickly connect users in distress with friends and send them contact information for help lines. It said experts also helped train dedicated Facebook teams, who have experience in law enforcement and crisis response, to review the most urgent cases. Those reviewers contact emergency services only in a minority of cases, when users appear at imminent risk of serious self-harm, the company said. ""While our efforts are not perfect, we have decided to err on the side of providing people who need help with resources as soon as possible,"" Emily Cain, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. [Share an experience about Facebook's suicide prevention program with The New York Times.] In a September post, Facebook described how it had developed a pattern recognition system to automatically score certain user posts and comments for likelihood of suicidal thoughts. The system automatically escalates high-scoring posts, as well as posts submitted by concerned users, to specially trained reviewers. ""Facebook has always been way ahead of the pack,"" said John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, ""not only in suicide prevention, but in taking an extra step toward innovation and engaging us with really intelligent and forward-thinking approaches."" (Vibrant Emotional Health, the nonprofit group administering the Lifeline, has advised and received funding from Facebook.) Facebook said its suicide risk scoring system worked worldwide in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic -- except for in the European Union, where data protection laws restrict the collection of personal details like health information. There is no way of opting out, short of not posting on, or deleting, your Facebook account.

A review of four police reports, obtained by The Times under Freedom of Information Act requests, suggests that Facebook's approach has had mixed results. Except for the Ohio case, police departments redacted the names of the people flagged by Facebook. In one case in May, a Facebook representative helped police officers in Rock Hill, S.C., locate a man who was streaming a suicide attempt on Facebook Live. On a recording of the call to the police station, the Facebook representative described the background in the video -- trees, a street sign -- to a police operator and provided the latitude and longitude of the man's phone. The Police Department credited Facebook with helping officers track down the man, who tried to flee and was taken to a hospital. ""Two people called the police that night, but they couldn't tell us where he was,"" said Courtney Davis, a Rock Hill police telecommunications operator, who fielded the call from Facebook. ""Facebook could.""

Scott W. Carline, chief of the Mashpee Police Department, declined to comment. But he said of Facebook, ""I'd like to see them improve upon the suicide prevention tools they have in place to identify warning signs that could potentially become fatal."" Facebook's Ms. Cain said that, in some cases, help unfortunately did not arrive in time. ""We really feel for those people and their loved ones when that occurs,"" she said. The fourth case, in May 2017, involved a teenager in Macon, Ga., who was streaming a suicide attempt. Facebook called the police after officers had already found the teenager at her home, a spokeswoman for the Bibb County sheriff's office said. The teen survived the attempt. Some health researchers are also trying to predict suicide risk, but they are using more transparent methodology and collecting evidence on the results. The Department of Veterans Affairs has developed a suicide risk prediction program that uses A.I. to scan veterans' medical records for certain medicines and illnesses. If the system identifies a veteran as high risk, the V.A. offers mental health appointments and other services. Preliminary findings from a V.A. study reported fewer deaths over all among veterans in the program compared with nonparticipating veterans. In a forthcoming article in a Yale law journal, Dr. Mason Marks, a health law scholar, argues that Facebook's suicide risk scoring software, along with its calls to the police that may lead to mandatory psychiatric evaluations, constitutes the practice of medicine. He says government agencies should regulate the program, requiring Facebook to produce safety and effectiveness evidence. ""In this climate in which trust in Facebook is really eroding, it concerns me that Facebook is just saying, 'Trust us here,'"" said Dr. Marks, a fellow at Yale Law School and New York University School of Law. Facebook's Ms. Cain disagreed that the program amounted to health screening. ""These are complex issues,"" she said, ""which is why we have been working closely with experts."""

As prime tomato-transplanting time arrives this month up north -- once the danger of frost has passed -- you may be in search of seedlings. Or maybe you started your tomatoes from seed, or have young plants (homegrown or store-bought) already in the ground, or in a big pot on your balcony. Whatever stage of the tomato timeline you're at, you may be wondering: What needs to happen next, in the weeks before that first ripe tomato? I asked Tom Stearns, who founded High Mowing Organic Seeds in 1996 and has grown a lot of tomatoes. ""The first seed I ever saved was a tomato's,"" said Mr. Stearns, who in the decades since has trialed heirlooms and hybrids at his Vermont farm, helping breeders from Cornell, the University of New Hampshire, Oregon State University and elsewhere fine-tune the development of new organic varieties. Mr. Stearns's company, which has the largest selection of certified organic seed varieties in North America, has seen a 300 percent increase in home-garden sales since mid-March. With other seed sellers reporting similar upticks, that probably means a lot of people are trying their first vegetable gardens -- and their first tomato plants.

Big-box stores typically have limited choices, familiar basic varieties. ""Farm stands and farmers' markets will have much more diversity -- more options, and more interesting options,"" Mr. Stearns said. Many independent garden centers also buy from local farmers, if there is no stand nearby. ""Plus, the farmer knows the varieties, and not just their flavors, but how they grow in your area,"" Mr. Stearns said. Ask about the disease-resistance and how big each variety gets -- whether it's a determinate or bush type, with less of a vining habit than rangy indeterminates that can grow as high as 10 feet.

""There are not too many cases where I think the use of a fossil-fuel product is worth it on the home-garden scale,"" Mr. Stearns said. ""But tomatoes are one case where that has merit."" Landscape fabric is a more resource-conscious alternative, he said: ""A 20-foot strip can mulch a row of 10 plants for 10 years."" Roll it up at the season's end to store and reuse. Southern growers get a pass on this. ""If you're in a warm place, where heat is not your limiting factor, go with straw,"" Mr. Stearns advised. All mulches suppress weeds and conserve moisture, fostering what Mr. Stearns calls ""tomato-hygiene management,"" which is critical because tomatoes are susceptible to fungal, bacterial, viral and other diseases.

A clean mulch layer between the soil surface and the lowest leaves -- the bottom rung on the ladder on which disease spores can splash up and start to climb the plant -- is a key defense. Bonus tip: Remove the lowest set of leaves before planting, so the first rung is that much harder to reach. ""Especially in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and upper Midwest, as an example, the fungal diseases Septoria and early blight are in your soil all the time,"" Mr. Stearns said. ""Rotating where you grow your tomatoes from year to year is not really going to help -- you must manage the disease.""

""Tomato root systems are enormous, and most varieties are pretty good at foraging for nutrients three or four feet away from the main stem,"" Mr. Stearns said. At his farm, fish emulsion is added to the irrigation water, providing beneficial micronutrients. The heavy-feeder reputation can prompt unnecessary fertilization. ""There is a risk that concentrated nitrogen fertilizer can promote green growth at the expense of fruit,"" he said, ""and even make plants vulnerable to disease."" Fungal diseases like nothing better than a humid jungle. So make sure plants in a row are 18 inches apart, and leave at least four feet between rows with pruned plants that you have staked or trellised (or more with unpruned caged plants). And don't hesitate to prune, because increased airflow and light help plants stay vigorous. ""A tomato makes about twice as many branches and leaves as it needs to produce fruit,"" Mr. Stearns said. ""So you can cut off all the suckers"" -- those small shoots that sprout where the stem and a side branch meet -- ""and every other leaf, and have no negative impact on yields."" Just don't prune before the dew dries or after a rain: Stay out of the tomato row when foliage is wet to minimize spreading trouble.

But Mr. Stearns recommends trellising: ""It promotes good yields; it's easy to see what's going on with your plants; and fruit is easy to harvest without damaging anything."" There are various trellis techniques, including the Florida weave, where twine is woven, figure-eight style, in and out of a series of posts set a foot deep in the tomato row (get the how-to on the High Mowing blog). As plants grow, more weaving is added every eight inches or so up the posts. ""Again: Think air circulation,"" he said. ""Never do a tomato tepee, with several plants tied up to one support. Inside, it will be like 100 percent humidity -- dew will never dry off in there. All the plants need is 24 hours at 100 percent humidity and disease is happening, disease you can help prevent."" Mulch helps, but in the extreme situation of a fast-draining sandy soil in hot weather, your plants may require twice-weekly watering. Stick a finger into the soil to feel whether it is slightly moist -- which it should be at all times.

Tomatoes crave full sun and warm soil. While Southern gardeners can just mulch with straw, in the North, preheat soil before transplanting with black plastic or reusable landscape fabric. And don't transplant until the danger of frost is past. Practice good tomato hygiene: Prevent soil splash, potentially laden with disease spores, from getting up onto plants. A mulch layer helps, and so does pruning off the lowest set of leaves before planting. Open plants up to light and air by spacing 18 inches apart within a row and leaving four feet between rows. Cage if you don't plan to prune, but better yet: Prune and trellis your plants. Plant deep -- really deep -- because tomatoes form roots off buried stem tissue, becoming more drought-resilient. Don't overfeed: In a fertile soil, tomatoes don't need the bagged stuff, which can cause excess green growth at the expense of fruit, and promote disease. Be vigilant for trouble signs, especially yellowing leaves. Remove and discard. For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here. Follow us on Twitter: @nytrealestate."

In this Sadler's Wells London production, his music - described as ""sonic surrealism"" - is muse to four choreographers. Wayne McGregor tackles ""Concentric Paths,"" a violin concerto; Karole Armitage sets a duet to ""Life Story"" with piano and voice; and Alexander Whitley interprets ""Piano Quintet"" (with Mr. Ades on piano). The showstopper is Crystal Pite's ""Polaris,"" set to the orchestra of the same name, which she has called ""epic."" With 66 dancers, so too is her dance.

'Murray Louis -- A Celebration of the Legendary Choreographer' (Friday) Alwin Nikolais has been called ""modern dance's pioneer of multimedia."" One of his star dancers and artistic comrades was Murray Louis, who in 1953 created his own eponymous dance company. As part of the 92nd Street Y's Fridays at Noon series, dancers from Marymount College will perform three of Mr. Louis's works: ""Bach Suite"" (1956), ""Geometrics"" (1974) and ""Four Brubeck Pieces"" (1984). Archival footage will also be shown, and original members of Mr. Louis's dance company will discuss his avant-garde impact on 20th-century dance. At noon, 1395 Lexington Avenue, 212-415-5500, 92y.org. (Schaefer) New Chamber Ballet (Friday and Saturday) The latest program from Miro Magloire's company includes four works by Mr. Magloire: an expanded version of ""Gravity,"" a trio to music by the 90-year-old Austrian composer Friedrich Cerha; ""The Other Woman,"" set to Bach; ""Friction,"" which depicts interpersonal tension to music by Richard Carrick; and a new duet to solo piano by Beat Furrer. The company's resident choreographer Constantine Baecher contributes ""Mozart Trio,"" in which the dancers discuss their feelings, in words as well as movement. The often-unfamiliar music, played live, is always a highlight. At 8 p.m., City Center Studios, 130 West 56th Street, Manhattan, 212-868-4444, newchamberballet.com. (Schaefer)  Miki Orihara (Friday through Sunday) The conundrum of the thought experiment called ""Schrodinger's cat"" concerns the unknown point of transition from one physical state to another. That question inspired the dancer and choreographer Miki Orihara, celebrated for her captivating work with the Martha Graham Dance Company, to create ""In the Box."" Directed by the theatrical visual-effects specialist Hiroyuki Nishiyama (a.k.a. nissy), ""In the Box"" uses interactive projections to explore the paradox of ""Where Technology Meets the Body,"" as the show's subtitle explains. Friday and Saturday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Martha Graham Studio Theater, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, 212-229-9200, inthebox-nyc.com. (Schaefer) Paul Taylor Commissions: Doug Elkins & Larry Keigwin (Saturday and Sunday) Earlier this year, when Mr. Taylor expanded his dance company to become a center for preserving and promoting American modern dance, he took the big step of commissioning new works from younger artists to add to his extensive repertory. Excerpts from creations by Mr. Elkins and Mr. Keigwin are the focus of this program, performed by Mr. Taylor's troupe as part of the Guggenheim Museum's Works & Process series. Several of Mr. Taylor's own dances, as well as a discussion with Mr. Elkins, Mr. Keigwin and the Paul Taylor biographer Suzanne Carbonneau, will round out the evening. At 7 p.m., Peter B.

In collaboration with Steven Banks, a writer of ""SpongeBob SquarePants,"" the company delivers a mix of theatrical spectacle and physical inventiveness soaked in wonder. As per its title, ""Shadowland"" showcases two-dimensional silhouettes formed by creative contortions of the body. (No performances on Thanksgiving and Nov. 30.) At various times, Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, 866-811-4111, nyuskirball.org.

54199,"Simpler, Less Expensive 401(k) Options Emerge for Small Businesses","Most employers with fewer than 100 workers don't offer 401(k) plans, and when they do, they're expensive. But the landscape is quickly changing.","Jon Stein, the founder and chief of Betterment, a so-called robo-adviser with 106,000 customers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/12/your-money/12money-pic1/12money-pic1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=acd749b9082ab6a47b65b438c371bf13e786916ba5901f8af4e63e25a7f70b63&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/your-money/401-k-options-for-small-businesses.html,051ce49d-3773-5d28-802b-452ae7591300.jpg,"The way Jon Stein sees it, receiving financial advice for retirement should be a fundamental right. Betterment, the investment firm Mr. Stein created just five years ago, is now one of the more prominent of the so-called robo-advisers -- companies that automatically build and manage customized portfolios of low-cost investments for people who cannot afford the type of financial adviser who sits behind a mahogany desk. He argues that all workers who save using a 401(k) should be entitled to personalized help and investment management services: When an employer offers a retirement plan without any recommendations, Mr. Stein reasons, it's akin to providing a health insurance plan that lists medications without any doctors. Given that philosophy, perhaps it was only a matter of time before his firm -- with 106,000 customers and $2.6 billion in assets -- would plunge into the 401(k) business. Starting in the first quarter of next year, the firm will begin offering the plans to employers, with a focus on smaller businesses (though it's essentially equipped to handle larger ones, too). Small businesses, which employ nearly half of all private sector workers, could surely use the help. Only 14 percent of employers with fewer than 100 employees offer a 401(k) plan, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. Even when these workers have access to a 401(k), they often pay three times as much as workers at larger companies, if not more. And if the business owner bought the 401(k) plan from a broker, the investment lineup might be rife with conflicts of interest and high-cost, actively managed mutual funds. As for financial advice, it's not always an option.

But the landscape is rapidly evolving. In addition to Betterment, several other technology-driven providers have started offering 401(k) plans in recent years, with a focus on reducing costs and the complex administrative burdens for small employers. Vanguard started catering to smaller businesses about four years ago and has already signed up more than 4,000 employers covering 162,000 participants. Mr. Stein said he hoped to elevate 401(k) plans to the next level, bringing the kind of holistic service that personal finance nerds could only dream of. You know, things like automatic management and rebalancing, taking into account your rollover Individual Retirement Account, a spouse's plans and future Social Security benefits. By looking at the entire picture, it can tell you how much you need to save and in which accounts -- say a 401(k) versus a Roth or taxable account. ""That is like fundamental stuff that everyone should have a right to if we are going to put the responsibility of saving for retirement on individuals, which is what we've done in this country,"" said Mr. Stein from Betterment's offices, a loft space that was formerly a dojo, or martial arts studio, in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

The fees for small plans also tend to vary greatly. The vast majority of 401(k)'s with less than $1 million in total assets had costs that ranged somewhere from 0.68 percent to a scandalous 2.66 percent. Part of the reason is economics. Small plans have less money to manage, so they generate less in fees and have less negotiating power. But another driving factor is the way the industry is structured. ""It has tended to attract the high-cost providers in part because of the economics, but in part because in this area of the market, the plans are sold, not bought,"" said Mike Alfred, co-founder and chief executive of BrightScope, which tracks and rates retirement plans. ""So there is an adviser or rep going into that company and convincing the chief executive officer, human resources or the chief financial officer to set up a plan,"" he added. ""And usually the high-cost providers are the ones that have the economics to pay the adviser to support that effort."" In case you haven't already heard, paying all those fees can seriously affect your nest egg: Paying just 1 percentage point more annually could reduce savings by nearly 30 percent over an individual's working career, according to Labor Department calculations. Imagine an employee who saved $25,000 in a 401(k); she doesn't make any new contributions and earns 7 percent over the next 35 years. If she paid 0.5 percent in total fees, the account would grow to $227,000. But paying fees totaling 1.5 percent would leave her with $163,000 -- that's 28 percent less. For the tiniest companies, Betterment will charge .60 percent of plan assets, plus the cost of the actual investments, which tend to be another .1 percent, on average. There is also a $1,500 setup fee for new plans. The fees decline as the company's assets grow.

His team learned a lot when they were shopping around for their own 401(k), back in early 2014 when they had about 50 employees. ""We found this process to be super difficult for us, and we are pretty sophisticated,"" said Mr. Stein, who ultimately chose Vanguard. Though Vanguard charges a flat fee per participant, he said it cost them the equivalent of 0.82 percent of total assets. Even though the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plans, now requires plan providers to itemize their costs of services -- separating investment costs from administrative ones -- comparing plan prices can still be mind-boggling, particularly for a time-constrained entrepreneur. The Labor Department is now trying to take its oversight a step further, and has proposed a rule that would require more brokers to act in the best interest of their small business customers when selling retirement plans and suggesting investments, a rule that is now easily bypassed. (Brokers must meet a five-part test before they are deemed a fiduciary, which means they must put their customers' interest before their own.) Depending on how the final rule is written, it could force even more transparency. The financial services industry has argued that such a rule would make it too costly to work with smaller investors and plans, but there are plenty of providers, including Betterment, lining up to take their place, at least in the 401(k) space."

What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. President Trump's vulgar comments about immigrants from Haiti and parts of Africa -- what he called ""shithole countries"" -- inevitably served as late-night TV fodder on Thursday. But most hosts had a hard time figuring out how to make them funny (and all shows but Trevor Noah's bleeped out the operative word). ""Trump reportedly said, 'Why are we having all these people from [expletive] countries come here?'

Jimmy Kimmel, calling the comments ""unfathomable,"" said he was sure it was a coincidence that the countries Mr. Trump disparaged are ""mostly populated by people of color."" ""Because if it wasn't, it would mean we voted for a racist -- like a real one -- and we'd have to get pitchforks and chase him out of the White House. But I also assume the White House would deny he said that. They did not. They just tried to spin it. It really is unfathomable."" -- JIMMY KIMMEL Mr. Colbert said that as long as he uses this kind of speech, Mr. Trump probably shouldn't accuse other world leaders of being divisive. ""Now, at one point Donald Trump said that North Korea might be trying to drive a wedge between the U.S. and South Korea, but assured us that 'I know more about wedges than any human being that's lived.'

NOAH: You wrote an op-ed in and around Donald Trump, comparing him to Bernie Sanders, explaining the differences and trying to show how different their worldviews were. And the president then wrote you a personal letter on your own column. I think we have the picture here, what he wrote. It reads, ""Dear Kareem, Now I know why the press always treated you so badly. They couldn't stand you. The fact is that you don't have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again. Best wishes, Donald Trump.""

Getting Serious About Climate Change?,"" by Ericka Andersen (Op-Ed, Aug. 8):

The proposals that are cited as evidence of the Republicans' turnaround on climate change focus on carbon capture, which allows polluters to keep burning fossil fuels so long as they capture their emissions.

But carbon capture has not been proved to work efficiently, cost-effectively or at scale, nor does it offer relief to the communities whose health has been devastated by decades of exposure to fossil fuels. Though natural carbon capture -- protecting forests, restoring wetlands -- will likely be part of a solution to climate change, there is no path away from the climate crisis that relies solely on capturing carbon.

Given the brief window we have left to avert catastrophic warming, we must deploy proven solutions like clean energy and not wait for carbon capture to become our deus ex machina. When Republicans stop blocking and delaying these solutions, I'll be ready to say the party has truly changed.

LONDON -- One very sticky afternoon last month -- amid a surprisingly crowded summer theater season -- Michael Billington came calling on me in the un-air-conditioned Marylebone flat where I was staying for a few weeks. Mr. Billington has been the drama critic for The Guardian since 1971 and is probably the most revered member of his profession in this country. At 78, he retains the air of the enthusiastic Oxford student he must have been more than half a century ago. He arrived bearing notes -- taken during research he had conducted in anticipation of our meeting -- and a gift, a paperback edition of his 2015 book, ""The 101 Greatest Plays: From Antiquity to the Present."" The subject of greatness, in absolute terms, was what we were there to discuss (coolly, rationally). Mr. Billington had come at my invitation to share sparkling water (too warm for tea) and a gentleman's debate about theatrical excellence, the arbitrariness of lists and the differences between the British and American drama. Both of our publications had recently offered compilations of the best in contemporary theater that their respective homelands had to offer, each numbering 25.

The New York Times list, which was published at the beginning of June, appeared under the headline ""The Great Work Continues: The 25 Best American Plays Since 'Angels in America."" The Guardian responded, at the end of that month, with Mr. Billington's, ""Knockouts, Nobles and Nukes: The 25 Best British Plays Since 'Jerusalem.'"" The number of years covered by these assessments is different: ""Angels in America,"" by Tony Kushner, appeared on Broadway in 1993, while Jez Butterworth's ""Jerusalem"" was first staged at London's Royal Court Theater in 2008. Since each list was restricted to its country of origin, there is no overlap between them.

And while it took a village of critics -- Jesse Green, Laura Collins-Hughes, Alexis Soloski, Elisabeth Vincentelli and me, along with The Times's theater editor, Scott Heller -- to assemble our collection, Mr. Billington was the sole arbiter for The Guardian. Another difference was organizational -- and qualitative. We listed our choices in order of ""greatness,"" beginning with ""Topdog/Underdog"" by Suzan-Lori Parks. Mr. Billington arranged his alphabetically. (Works on that list that New York audiences might be familiar with include Mike Bartlett's ""King Charles III,"" Lucy Prebble's ""Enron,"" Lucy Kirkwood's ""The Children"" and the Broadway-bound ""The Ferryman"" by Mr. Butterworth.)

Nonetheless, we found our lists had much in common. And not only because each was both a sop and a deliberate provocation, playing to this era's hunger for quantification of all things yet intended to spark dissent and debate. We also agreed that whether the period under consideration was a decade or a quarter-century, 25 didn't begin to accommodate the range and depth of first-rate new work. While there may have been qualms of conscience on our parts about omissions (and inclusions), this abundance seemed an encouraging sign regarding the state of the English-language play. So was the variety of the playwrights, and the reach of their subjects. Half of the dramatists on The Guardian's list, and more than a third on The Times's, were women, with members of ethnic minority groups making up more than a fifth (The Guardian) and a fourth (The Times) of those chosen. In neither case had there been anything resembling a conscious quota. ""It didn't require any special pleading,"" Mr. Billington said. ""It was just instinctive and spontaneous.""

We also found that in both lists, none of the plays had originated -- nor been specifically conceived -- as large-scale commercial theater projects. And we were of one mind in thinking that Broadway and its London equivalent, the West End, had become all but irrelevant as breeding grounds for original work. In both cases, a majority of the chosen plays addressed issues of race, gender and, in the unfailing case of the British, class, often in combination. Perhaps the biggest surprise to both of us was the ways in which they did so, suggesting a shift in the traditional balance between the classically domestic American drama and the British state-of-the-nation play.

I observed to Mr. Billington that I hadn't thought of the American theater as being as topical as the British theater, in regularly engaging in conversation with the daily headlines. But when I looked back, I began to revise my opinion. Mr. Billington agreed: ""The received notion was that American theater dealt very well with private issues and British theater with public and political issues. But it strikes me that there's been some sort of role reversal, British dramatists having learned from Americans that you can write plays set in one room that still engage with public and political issues."" It's a point of view confirmed even by the two works we used as anchors for our lists: Mr. Kushner's ""Angels in America"" is, after all, subtitled ""A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,"" and travels not only through history but also the cosmos; Mr. Butterworth's ""Jerusalem,"" though resonant with implicit questions about national identity, takes place in and around a drug dealer's trailer in a forest. Both works, for the record, have been seen and acclaimed on either side of the Atlantic. This year's Tony-laden revival of ""Angels"" originated at London's National Theater. In general, the flow of theatrical traffic between London and New York has never been so thick or so fluid.

Mr. Billington saw both gains and losses in this. ""Is there a danger of our cultures becoming too similar?"" he asked. ""In these exchanges, are London theater and New York theater becoming almost too parallel? Because if I go to New York, I don't want to see British plays, I want to see American plays."" Not, he added quickly, that he hasn't been delighted by the chance to see American playwrights like Annie Baker on his own turf. ""She sets her own rules, doesn't she?"" he said. ""She creates her own tempo and makes you surrender to it.""

Mr. Billington wondered if the age of the titans was over in the English-speaking theater and felt that in Britain there was no longer a dominating pantheon, no younger-generation equivalents of Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard. ""We don't have identifiable Big Beasts, as it were,"" he said. ""But we have a much richer plurality of talent.""

 And he lamented the lack of classical repertory theaters that abounded through the Britain he knew when he was growing up in Warwickshire. ""We're plugged into the present in a very exciting way,"" he said. ""But I think we're losing sight not just of our past but of the theater's past."" Mr. Billington's ""101 Greatest Plays"" begins with Aeschylus's ""The Persians"" and ends with Mr. Bartlett's ""King Charles III.""

59394,"Buying a Sports Team Takes Heart and Cash, Plenty of It","Stuart Sternberg is a Mets fan, but he is the principal owner of the Tampa Bay Rays. Buying a stake in a sports team means not just investing passionately, but joining a very exclusive club.","""I don't think about the value of it because I'm not selling it,"" says Stuart Sternberg of the Tampa Bay Rays.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/02/your-money/02wealth/02wealth-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=1264a1c9dd9980ffb89fcdd519c18e539d5dcc4506cdc805898b318edc3dbb9a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/your-money/stuart-sternberg-loves-the-mets-owns-the-rays-and-loves-a-challenge.html,7d939d7f-a19c-5de2-8d08-1549a26e2898.jpg,"SITTING at Citi Field this week, I started thinking about whether I would care more about the game, between the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies, if I owned one of the teams. I'm not a fan of either club -- a friend had an extra ticket and invited me -- but my reverie was prompted by a recent talk I had with Stuart L. Sternberg. Mr. Sternberg, a lifelong Mets fan who made his fortune as an options trader, told me he had inquired about buying a stake in the team in 2002. At the time, Nelson Doubleday was looking to sell his half. Fred Wilpon, who owned the other half, bought Mr. Doubleday's share. Having expressed interest in a team, Mr. Sternberg was shown other baseball clubs that were for sale. Two years later, in 2004, he became a minority owner of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, one of the worst teams in baseball and one that he had never rooted for. He said it seemed to be a good deal. A year later, he was the principal owner. ""It was a little misunderstood and a little mispriced,"" Mr. Sternberg said. But he said he thought that many of the things that had been hurting the team could be fixed. ""If given time and nothing else, those difficulties, mostly related to bad contracts, would diminish. Over time, like an option, they would expire.""

In 2008, Mr. Sternberg watched as his team, which he renamed the Rays, won their first American League Championship and went on to the World Series. (They lost to the Phillies in five games.) The Rays made it into the playoffs in two of the next three years, with one of the lowest payrolls in the sport. I have been writing for the last few weeks about passion investments -- putting money into films, racehorses, restaurants, franchises and vineyards -- that appeal as much to the heart as the head. But sports teams are different in several ways. They require an enormous amount of cash upfront and come with all sorts of rules decreed by the various leagues, including limits on the amount that can be financed and restrictions on what the principal owner can do with the franchise. Still, the high prices and the restrictions have not slowed interest in buying sports teams, Major League Baseball in particular. Mr. Wilpon, hit with a lawsuit related to his investments with the Ponzi schemer Bernard L. Madoff, was forced to sell minority stakes in the Mets to 12 investors. Each 4 percent stake cost $20 million. Recently, a group of investors led by the basketball great Magic Johnson bought the Los Angeles Dodgers out of bankruptcy for $2.15 billion, a huge price that included real estate around the ballpark and the prospect of a lucrative cable deal next year. Now, the San Diego Padres are said to be up for sale, with some of the people who failed to acquire the Dodgers now interested. And there was the rumor that George Steinbrenner's heirs could be looking to sell the New York Yankees, an idea the organization quickly quashed.

So what's the appeal of owning a team? Mr. Sternberg said there were only three reasons: to win, to make money or to bask in the glow of being an owner. (He said he is focused on the first one.) Sure, teams can count on revenue from ticket sales, concessions and coveted television rights. And they can certainly appreciate in value -- Frank McCourt, whose divorce and legal troubles precipitated the sale of the Dodgers, bought the team in 2004 for $430 million. But it is a costly business to run, not just for the salaries of the players, coaches, scouts and staff but to maintain the stadium and provide the countless other details that make fans happy. ""You can make money in this,"" said Bradley Rangell, who leads Citi Private Bank's sports advisory business. ""You can make an investment in a rank-and-file team, manage it O.K. and ride the appreciation. Or you can do what happened in L.A. and put a business plan in place to develop around the team."" When Mr. Sternberg bought the Devil Rays, he said his friends thought he was crazy. The team was not good, and it was 1,200 miles from his home. ""I like things a bit messier,"" he said. ""It wasn't plug and play. I believed we could have some real positive effects on winning baseball games."" Mr. Rangell said that one of the big surprises for many investors came after they actually owned the team. Mr. Sternberg was no different. ""In the fall of 2005, they handed me the keys,"" he said. ""We knew enough to make the car run, but to make it run well was a different story."" Yet he said he didn't worry about the financial downsides. The team was at the bottom. He was concerned instead about becoming a public figure and what effect it would have on his family.

""I had no understanding of what it meant to become a public person,"" he said. ""Being out there is a necessary part of promoting our brand."" Paul Hubert, head of Citi Private Bank's sports finance and advisory business, said this is something often overlooked by families who have been able to keep their net worth under the radar. He cited the Lerner family, which made its money in real estate and then bought the Washington Nationals in 2006. But there is compensation for that loss of privacy. Mr. Sternberg bought his initial stake of the team when it was valued at $145 million. In March, Forbes said it was worth $323 million. ""I don't think of what it's worth,"" he said. ""It's like my house. I don't think about the value of it because I'm not selling it."" There are often small stakes of teams available, like the Mets deal. While this might seem an easier way into a sport, the bankers I spoke with said they have to counsel buyers on the implications of being one among many. ""As a limited partner, you don't have control,"" Mr. Hubert said. He said minority interests are good for people who are fans or who want to learn more with the hope of buying a team one day. One way to have full control at a much lower price is to buy a minor league team. Tom Seidler, whose grandfather was Walter O'Malley, the celebrated owner of the Dodgers, said it was the small-town feel that attracted him to become a minor league owner."
4300,Paul Theroux Recalls a Fear-Filled Lockdown,"In 1966, the writer was in Uganda at a time of curfew and violence. It shaped his thinking about travel writing's imperative to bear witness.",Smoke rising in Uganda during the 1966 upheaval.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/30/travel/30travel-theroux-essay/30travel-theroux-essay-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a058e1a32072baf2c4c11681fec5b8d90dbef85ce752d90ddc71d6d26abce4c7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/travel/coronavirus-travel-theroux-essay.html,08c2e13d-b41e-56d4-8efd-0330cfd9e081.jpg,"In this season of infection, the stock market little more than a twitching corpse, in an atmosphere of alarm and despondency, I am reminded of the enlightenments of the strict curfew Uganda endured in 1966. It was, for all its miseries, an episode of life lessons, as well as monotonous moralizing (because most crises enliven bores and provoke sententiousness). I would not have missed it for anything. That curfew evoked -- like today -- the world turned upside-down. This peculiarity that we are now experiencing, the nearest thing to a world war, is the key theme in many of Shakespeare's plays and Jacobean dramas, of old ballads, apocalyptic paintings and morality tales. It is the essence of tragedy and an occasion for license or retribution. As Hamlet says to his father's ghost, ""Time is out of joint."" In Uganda, the palace of the king of Buganda, the Kabaka, Mutesa II -- also known as King Freddie -- had been attacked by government troops on the orders of the prime minister, Milton Obote. From my office window at Makerere University, where I was a lecturer in English in the Extra Mural department, I heard the volleys of heavy artillery, and saw smoke rising from the royal enclosure on Mengo Hill. The assault, led by Gen. Idi Amin, resulted in many deaths. But the king eluded capture; he escaped the country in disguise and fled to Britain. The period that followed was one of oppression and confusion, marked by the enforced isolation of a dusk-to-dawn curfew. But, given the disorder and uncertainty, most people seldom dared to leave home at all.

""Kifugo!"" I heard again and again of the curfew -- a Swahili word, because it was the lingua franca there. ""Imprisonment!"" Yes, it was enforced confinement, but I also felt privileged to be a witness: I had never seen anything like it. I experienced the stages of the coup, the suspension of the constitution, the panic buying and the effects of the emergency. My clearest memory is of the retailing of rumors -- outrageous, frightening, seemingly improbable -- but who could dispute them? Our saying then was, ""Don't believe anything you hear until the government officially denies it."" Speaking for myself, as a traveler, any great crisis -- war, famine, natural disaster or outrage -- ought to be an occasion to bear witness, even if it means leaving the safety of home. The fact that it was the manipulative monster Chairman Mao who said, ""All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience,"" does not make the apothegm less true. It is or should be the subtext for all travelers' chronicles. Read More on the Coronavirus Pandemic

Even at the time, 24-years-old and fairly callow, I felt I was lucky in some way to be witnessing this convulsion. It was not just that it helped me to understand Africa better; it offered me insights into crowds and power and civil unrest generally, allowing me to observe in extreme conditions the nuances of human nature. I kept a journal. In times of crisis we should all be diarists and documentarians. We're bound to wail and complain, but it's also useful to record the particularities of our plight. We know the progress of England's Great plague of 1665 because Samuel Pepys anatomized it in his diary. On April 30 he wrote: ""Great fears of the sickness here in the City it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all!"" Later, on June 25, ""The plague increases mightily."" And by July 26: ""The Sicknesse is got into our parish this week; and is endeed everywhere.""

A month later he notes the contraction of business: ""To the Exchange, which I have not been a great while. But Lord how sad a sight it is to see the streets empty of people, and very few upon the Change, jealous of every door that one sees shut up lest it should be the plague -- and about us, two shops in three, if not more, generally shut up."" In that outbreak of bubonic plague, spread by rat fleas, a quarter of London's population died. My diary these days sounds a lot like Pepys', though without the womanizing, snobbery or name dropping. The progress of the Covid 19 pandemic is remarkably similar to that of the plague year, the same upside-down-ness and the dizziness it produces, the muddle of daily life, the collapse of commerce, the darkness at noon, a haunting paranoia in the sudden proximity to death. And so much of what concerned me as important in the earlier pages of my diary now seems mawkish, trivial or beneath notice. This virus has halted the routine of the day to day and impelled us, in a rare reflex from our usual hustling, to seek purification. Still writing gives order to the day and helps inform history. In my journal of the Ugandan curfew I made lists of the rumors and tried to estimate the rate at which they traveled; I noted the instances of panic and distraction -- there were many more car crashes than usual, as drivers' minds were on other things. Ordinary life was suspended, so we had more excuses to do as we pleased.

My parents' habits were formed during the Great Depression, which this present crisis much resembles. They were -- ever after -- frugal, cautious and scornful of wasters: My father developed a habit of saving string, paper bags, nails and screws that he pried out of old boards. The Depression made them distrustful of the stock market, regarding it as a casino. They were believers in education, yet their enduring memory was of highly educated people rendered destitute -- ""college graduates selling apples on street corners in Boston!"" My mother became a recycler and a mender, patching clothes, socking money away. This pandemic will likely make us a nation of habitual hand-washers and doorknob avoiders. In the Great Depression, Americans like my parents saw the country fail -- and though it rose and became vibrant once more, they fully expected to witness another bust in their lifetime. Generally speaking, we have known prosperity in the United States since the end of World War II. But the same cannot be said for other countries, and this, of course, is something many travelers know, because travel often allows us glimpses of upheaval or political strife, epidemics or revolution. Uganda evolved after the curfew into a dictatorship, and then Idi Amin took over and governed sadistically. But I'd lived in the dictatorship and thuggery of the Malawi of Dr. Hastings Banda (""Ngwazi"" -- the Conqueror), so Uganda's oppression was not a shock. And these experiences in Africa helped me deconstruct the gaudy dictatorship of Saparmurat Niyazov, who styled himself ""Tukmenbashi"" -- Great Head of the Turks -- when, years later, I traveled through Turkmenistan; the Mongolia of Jambyn Batmonkh, the Syria of Hafiz Assad, the muddy dispirited China of Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guo Feng. As for plague, there have been recent outbreaks of bubonic plague in Madagascar, Congo, Mongolia and China, producing national moods of blame-shifting and paranoia, not much different from that of Albert Camus's ""The Plague.""

We're told not to travel right now, and it's probably good advice, though there are people who say that this ban on travel limits our freedom. But in fact, travel produces its own peculiar sorts of confinement. The freedom that most travelers feel is often a delusion, for there is as much confinement in travel as liberation. This is not the case in the United States, where I have felt nothing but fresh air on road trips. It is possible to travel in the United States without making onward plans. But I can't think of any other country where you can get into a car and be certain at the end of the day of finding a place to sleep (though it might be scruffy) or something to eat (and it might be junk food). For my last book, I managed a road trip in Mexico -- but with hiccups (bowel-shattering meals, extortionate police, bed bugs). But the improvisational journey is very difficult elsewhere, even in Europe, and is next to impossible in Africa. It is only by careful planning that a traveler experiences a degree of freedom, but he or she will have to stick to the itinerary, nagged by instructions, which is a sort of confinement."

Li, Who Proved a Genetic Cancer Link, Dies at 75","Dr. Li helped show a skeptical medical establishment that a dominant gene, passed from parent to child, was predisposing family members to various cancers.",Frederick P. Li was one of the doctors who discovered a genetic condition in which cancer was passed on from generation to generation.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/us/22Li-obit/22Li-obit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=fbe6b1fca6d9bc1a7af252e081fcabcc69af910d3abd1b4c750eeb1013303cb9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/health/frederick-p-li-who-proved-a-genetic-cancer-link-dies-at-75.html,9eab3ef5-37d2-5e01-b936-1f9a55737d99.jpg,"Dr. Frederick P. Li, who helped prove to a doubting medical establishment that heredity and genetics play a major role in some forms of cancer, died on June 12 at his home in Brookline, Mass. He was 75. His wife, Dr. Elaine Shiang, confirmed his death and said the probable cause was Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Li had dementia for a number of years and retired in 2008 from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where he had worked for more than 30 years. Dr. Li, who was also a professor at Harvard's medical school and its school of public health, was best known for research that he began in the 1960s at the National Cancer Institute with Dr. Joseph F. Fraumeni. They discovered four families that, Dr. Fraumeni said in an interview, were ""loaded with cancer."" Generation after generation, family members were struck down by different forms of the disease, often when they were children or young adults. Some who survived one type of cancer later developed another. ""It was devastating,"" Dr. Fraumeni said, adding that in that era ""we knew almost nothing about the cause of cancer.""

As the two researchers gathered information, the detailed family trees they drew were dotted with grim, shaded symbols indicating people living with cancer and those who had died of it. The same pattern of disease emerged again and again, suggesting that a dominant gene, passed from parent to child, was predisposing family members to various cancers. The doctors first described their findings in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in 1969. The title of their report included the phrase ""A Familial Syndrome?"" Dr. Li insisted on the question mark, Dr. Fraumeni said, because he did not think they had enough data to state their hypothesis as a fact. They found more families like the first four, and confirmed their suspicions. The condition they described, which came to be called the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, is rare and dreaded, because people who have it are almost sure to develop cancer. When the researchers identified the syndrome, they did not know which gene caused it. They stored blood samples from the affected families in the hope that future research would find the answer. ""We thought genetic factors were involved,"" Dr. Fraumeni said. ""We thought it was an opportunity to search for an underlying mechanism that might apply to a wide variety of cancers.""

Initially, their findings were met with skepticism, Dr. Fraumeni said. Viruses and environmental factors like air pollution, occupational exposures and diet received more attention than genetics as potential causes of cancer. But the scientific landscape was changing fast. ""In the 1980s, the technology became available to look for susceptibility genes,"" Dr. Fraumeni said. In 1990, researchers collaborating with Dr. Li and Dr. Fraumeni identified the genetic defect responsible for many cases of the syndrome. It was an inherited mutation in a gene called TP53 -- a gene that, in its normal state, acts as a ""tumor suppressor"" and helps to prevent cancer. It is sometimes called the guardian of the genome. Mutations in the same gene are also involved in many types of cancer that are not part of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, so studying families that have the syndrome can yield information about cancer biology that may have broad implications, Dr. Fraumeni said. Dr. Li had great compassion for people with a genetic predisposition to cancer, and worked to find ways to help them prevent the disease or detect it early. He tracked cancer patients carefully to gauge the risk of subsequent tumors. He helped determine that people with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome were particularly sensitive to radiation, and that using it to treat their tumors could increase their risk of developing additional cancers. ""He was also very sensitive to the medical and ethical aspects of how genetic discoveries would impact patients and families,"" said Dr. Kenneth Offit, chief of the clinical genetics service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Dr. Li quickly recognized that once a genetic test for Li-Fraumeni syndrome became available, families would face tough questions. Did they want to know? Should children be tested? If they got bad news, what could they do about it? If a health insurer got the results, would the family be denied coverage? The same questions came up when other cancer-related genes were found, like the BRCA mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer.

""Fred Li was a true pioneer in the field of cancer genetics who anticipated most of the challenges we later faced,"" Dr. Offit said. Dr. Li was also a founder of a clinic for immigrants in Boston's Chinatown, and he sometimes worked there at nights, taking care of patients for no money. Frederick Pei Li was born in Canton, China, on May 7, 1940. He had three sisters and a brother. His father, Han Hun Li, was a general in the Chinese Army and fought in the second Sino-Japanese War. His mother, Chu Fang Wu, organized schools and orphanages for war widows and children in China. The family immigrated to the United States when Dr. Li was 7, and opened a Chinese restaurant in White Plains. Besides his wife, Dr. Li is survived by a son Andrew; two daughters, Margaret Li and Irene Li; three sisters, Virginia Li, Angela Li-Scholz and Tina Li; and two grandchildren. Dr. Li left high school early and enrolled at New York University when he was 16, earning a degree in physics. He studied medicine at the University of Rochester, earned a master's degree in demography from Georgetown University and went to work at the National Cancer Institute in 1967. In the early 1970s, still employed by the institute, he was sent to Dana-Farber as a medical officer in epidemiology. Dr. David G. Nathan, a former president of Dana-Farber, said Dr. Li had been sent there as part of an effort by the institute to bring more scientific rigor to cancer research. ""We're all sitting there rather stupidly at Dana-Farber, and in walks Fred Li,"" Dr. Nathan said. ""And he says: 'I'm for free. You don't have to pay me.' """

""Virgil can do whatever he wants,"" he wrote. ""Do you know how hard it's been for us to be recognized?"" The intended audience of Mr. West's posts: Walter Van Beirendonck, 63, a veteran Belgian designer who had accused Mr. Abloh of copying his work for his latest Louis Vuitton men's collection, presented live in Shanghai on Aug. 6. On Aug. 7, Mr. Van Beirendonck, who is the head of the fashion department at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp, posted an image of one of his own designs, a shirt with the words ""I HATE FASHION COPYCATS"" appliqued on the front.

Since 2018, Mr. Abloh, 39, has been the lead men's wear designer for Louis Vuitton, the flagship brand of LVMH. He has one of the most powerful jobs in the industry, and his tenure has been successful. ""He's standing at the pinnacle, and therefore he casts a long shadow, and he's a target for everyone,"" said Susan Scafidi, the president of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham Law School. Mr. Abloh, one of the first Black men to lead a global luxury brand, has degrees in civil engineering and architecture and a background in streetwear, including his own brands, Off-White and Pyrex Vision, and as creative director of Mr. West's company Donda. ""There is a little bit of snobbery about the fact that Virgil didn't train as a designer and 'pay his dues' to the industry in that way,"" Ms. Scafidi said. Mr. West has long claimed that the fashion industry was racially biased against him. He seemed to be referring to this same dynamic in his defense of Mr. Abloh, by accusing Mr. Van Beirendonck of using plagiarism claims as a way of gate-keeping the fashion industry. ""It's not just, 'My design was copied,' it's, 'That guy isn't a designer,'"" said Ms. Scafidi, characterizing Mr. Van Beirendonck's claims. Mr. Abloh has long been a lightning rod for pointed conversations about originality. In 2017, one of his fashion heroes, the Belgian designer Raf Simons, told GQ that he wasn't excited by Mr. Abloh's work because he is, rather, ""inspired by people who bring something that I think has not been seen, that is original."" A month later, Mr. Abloh presented an Off-White collection titled ""Nothing New,"" widely interpreted as a response to Mr. Simons. Printing unattributed phrases in quotation marks on clothing is one of Mr. Abloh's signatures, a cheeky nod to ideas of reference and authorship.

In a 2019 interview, Mr. Abloh told The New York Times that he believes his talent lies not in the creation of wholly unique designs, but rather in making something new by altering existing objects by as little as 3 percent. In 2018, Diet Prada, the plagiarism watchdog Instagram page run by Tony Liu and Lindsey Schuyler, accused him of copying Paul McCobb, the renowned maker of midcentury modern furniture, for a chair Mr. Abloh designed for Ikea. A year later, the account also claimed he'd copied a brand called Colrs. (The account has not yet addressed Mr. Van Beirendonck's accusations, which led to the Belgian designer scoffing that the account was in the tank for Louis Vuitton. Mr. West, in turn, posted an image of himself and Mr. Abloh embracing, and wrote, ""Hi diet Prada hi Walter ... come for us all!!!"")

Mr. Abloh has suggested that Belgian design is perceived as bastion of authenticity, an idea that has something of a figurehead in Mr. Van Beirendonck. The designer was a member of the Antwerp Six, a collective that transformed the city into an avant-garde fashion destination in the 1980s. He's spent the following three decades cultivating a reputation for iconoclastic originality; his brash, colorful designs often toy with masculinity and reference forms of play. His work influenced 1990s rave culture and also Mr. Simons, who interned for him in 1989. While Mr. Van Beirendonck has received critical acclaim throughout his career, he does not enjoy the same degree of commercial success as Mr. Abloh. His work has long involved cartoonish characters, like Puk Puk, the cheerful alien mascot who adorned many of the designs he created in the 1990s for his brand Wild & Lethal Trash. Mr. Abloh's recent Louis Vuitton show, inspired by a cartoon he made titled ""The Adventures of Zooom with Friends,"" also featured clothes festooned with humans and animal figures; on Instagram, Mr. Van Beirendonck reposted an image made by a fan page which pointed out similarities between his own work and Mr. Abloh's designs.

""Throughout all these years in fashion, I have patiently built up a signature language,"" Mr. Van Beirendonck told Knack Weekend. ""That language is mine. It's me. And he takes it, makes a copy of it. You can reinterpret things, do them in a different way. But this is just embarrassing."" Mr. Abloh seemingly responded to Mr. Van Beirendonck's claims on Thursday, when he tweeted images from a 2005 Louis Vuitton show in which the models carried teddy bears down the runway. In the United States, fashion copyright law does not cover three-dimensional designs (unlike two-dimensional prints or patterns). However, Louis Vuitton is headquartered in France, where the intellectual property laws that protect fashion copyright are far more broad. Based on the similarity of the designs in question, Ms. Scafidi believes Mr. Van Beirendonck could file a ""plausible claim"" against Louis Vuitton if he wanted to. She cited a landmark 1994 case in which Yves Saint Laurent successfully sued Ralph Lauren in Paris over a tuxedo dress design. The trial involved models wearing dresses in front of a judge, who subsequently ordered Ralph Lauren to pay $350,000 in damages. Were Mr. Beirendonck to file a suit, he wouldn't have to prove that Mr. Abloh intentionally copied him. ""The mens rea doesn't matter,"" Ms. Scafidi said, using a legal term for knowledge of wrongdoing. ""As long as there is a similarity between the objects and there was at least some reasonable potential for one to have seen the other, and clearly that's the case here,"" then a lawsuit could move forward. Of course, that doesn't mean it will. ""Twitter's much quicker and much less expensive,"" she said."

In a news release, George Witte, the editor in chief of St. Martin's Press, said the book would cover the former White House press secretary's years working for President Trump and offer ""a unique perspective on the most important issues, events and both public and behind-the-scenes conversations inside the White House.""

The publisher declined to comment further. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.

Ms. Sanders worked on Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and joined the administration when he was elected. She served as his press secretary from July 2017 until she left the White House in June. Mr. Trump praised her loyalty, calling her ""a warrior,"" and encouraged her to run for governor of Arkansas, a position once held by her father, Mike Huckabee. She also became known for her confrontations with reporters, and for doing away with the decades-old tradition of formal daily press briefings, arranging instead for the president to speak and answer questions for himself.

""I'm excited to tell my story about the challenges of being a working mom at the highest level of American politics and my role in the historic fight raging between the Trump administration and its critics for the future of our country,"" Ms. Sanders said in the release."
53810,Video Review: BMW i8 Is a Futuristic Hybrid That Drives Like a Rocket,"This plug-in has an all-electric range of 22 miles, but it also has a turbocharged 1.5-liter gasoline engine, which helps propel the car to 60 m.p.h. in 4 seconds.",2015 BMW i8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/06/automobiles/autoreviews/driven-bmw-i8/driven-bmw-i8-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=6ae01cd23e083d8ce4ad5dfff78a13a4028b674a5025ac9a9050c0b12d5d6c08&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/automobiles/autoreviews/video-review-bmw-i8-is-a-futuristic-hybrid-that-drives-like-a-rocket.html,174998a5-d0b6-501e-8c8e-45e71ac94805.jpg,"Books and movies depict the future as a bleak dystopian world. BMW's view is considerable more optimistic with hybrids that look like spacecraft and move like, well, BMWs. The i8 starts at $137,495. Not cheap. As-tested at 150K, it's still a giveaway considering it is transportation, an amusement park thrill ride, and investment grade art backed by a staggering engineering budget. Doc Brown may ditch the DeLorean for one after figuring out how to integrate a Mr. Fusion. Consider this- stuck in creeping highway traffic with a Porsche Panamera 4S on my bumper, the i8 had the visual power to render the German completely invisible. Never have so many drivers broken the no-phone rule so gleefully. Here's how BMW builds the future of fun; The passenger cell is made from extremely light and strong carbon fiber reinforced plastic fused to an aluminum structure. There's an electric motor up front and an over-achieving turbocharged 1.5-liter 3- cylinder aft of the passengers. The motor drives the front wheels through a two-speed gearbox, the engine turns the back rubber with a 6-speed. Total horsepower is 357 horsepower with 420 lb-ft of torque, certainly enough to move 3455 pounds. i8 is a plug-in hybrid. Charge the lithium-ion battery running down the center spine for a claimed all-electric range of 22 miles at up to 75 miles an hour. Charging isn't necessary, just more efficient. A full fill takes 1.5 hours with 220V. 0-60 isn't quite the jump to hyperspace but few cars do it in 4 seconds. It'll dust your neighbor's Prius on its way to vanquishing that Panamera. A center of gravity just 18 inches off the road keeps cornering tenacious. Only Katniss Everdeen has a keener aim. More road feel would be appreciated but performance junkies can feel great about saving gas. The E.P.A. rates the combined gas + electric fuel economy at 76 MPGe, gasoline-only efficiency is 28 mpg. Remember, 0-60 in 4 seconds. How could you forget? i8's power flow is similar to any hybrid with a powertrain that's remarkable seamless. It's like driving any regular car, one that's very fast. A satisfying growl comes from the 3- cylinder's direction, some of it is synthetic sound piped in for more bravado. The best way past the scissor doors and high sill is to drop into the cabin. Laced with indigo light piping, Tron must be revered in Bavaria. Apparently global warming isn't an issue with no vented seat option. Nein on the AM radio too, BMW says the electric drivetrain interferes with reception. i8 is a 2 + 2, don't plan on stuffing adults you like in back. Cup holders are an optimistic touch. The back hatch cover is made of two thin sheets of high- strength smartphone glass with an acoustic layer between. The space below it is either a very small trunk or very large glove box. You want space with your think-tank BMW? Buy the breadbox-like i3. That's i8's biggest offence; it's not practical. But BMW has done a remarkable job infusing efficiency with sculpture and performance. Best of all, it's not made by the Soylent Corporation."

A comedy flecked with seriousness, it revisits a 1970 feminist protest against the Miss World pageant in London. Bright and insistently upbeat, the movie has period polish, some swinging detail and a sympathetic cast headed by Keira Knightley, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jessie Buckley. Like most commercial movies about feminist history, though, it also has a toothless vision of protest and empowerment that's doomed to fail its subject because its makers don't (can't) risk making the audience uncomfortable.

Directed by Philippa Lowthorpe, the movie personalizes its story with a manageable handful of characters, including Sally Alexander (a fine Knightley), an academic. In short, bouncy scenes, she is shown as smart and ambitious, loved by her family but thwarted by her sexist colleagues, which leads her to join the nascent women's liberation movement. Her ostensible opposite is Jennifer Hosten (Mbatha-Raw), a.k.a. Miss Grenada, who arrives amid a sorority of giggling contestants. Jennifer isn't given much to do or say, but Mbatha-Raw makes it clear that the character has an inner life, with faraway looks that you hope foretell that a more interesting movie is on the horizon.

The two women are ready-made for dialectical fun but are largely separated on parallel tracks. The movie -- the script is by Rebecca Frayn and Gaby Chiappe -- establishes two opposing camps: one populated by the pageant people, the other by the feminists, including Buckley's Jo Robinson, a live wire. While men linger in the background on Team Libbers, they take a prominent role on Team Pageant because the filmmakers seem to think the audience needs reminding that sexist men can be, well, sexist. So, rather than deep, revealing looks into the lives of the contestants, there's a lot of the show's host, Bob Hope (an affable Greg Kinnear with a fake schnoz).

Lowthorpe spends a wearying amount of time on the comedy of male buffoonery. The marquee clown is Hope, who's introduced in the opening via parallel montage with Sally, and comes with his own aggrieved woman (Lesley Manville, adding bitter tang to Mrs. Hope). The most cartoonish buffoon, however, is Eric (Rhys Ifans), who with his wife, Julia (Keeley Hawes), runs the contest. It's mildly amusing to watch Ifans swan about in a pageant crown and cape when he shows the contestants how to walk onstage. The contenders tee-hee-hee and you might too, even if there's nothing all that funny about how strenuously the movie tries to soft-pedal sexual exploitation."

During this spring season, it has been dancing choreography by four thoroughly unalike 20th-century masters -- Leonide Massine, George Balanchine, Kenneth MacMillan and Frederick Ashton -- and, often enough, the standards it has set in each have been world class.

Last week at the Metropolitan Opera House, Ashton's wonderful, strange and elusive three-act ""Cinderella"" (1948), set to Prokofiev's 1945 score, joined the company's repertory. The roles of Cinderella and the Prince were danced by four casts; supporting roles were taken by two or three interpreters. Many New Yorkers kept returning to it in fascination and awe: something only possible because of the stylistic immersion with which Ballet Theater's dancers committed themselves to Ashton's work.

He created ""Cinderella"" with the company that is today's Royal Ballet; but, though the work is beloved, many of its roles, steps and jokes have proved far from fail-safe. Today the ballet is staged -- at Covent Garden and for companies around the world -- by Wendy Ellis Somes and Malin Thoors. The chance to watch successive Ballet Theaterperformances gave hope that the company can get much more of this ballet right than was evident at Monday's opening night.

Ballet Theater has quickly absorbed an idiom that includes some of the most multidirectional dancing in the ballet lexicon, and that often coordinates separate upper- and lower-body movements with rococo intricacy. Already its dancers execute some things much better than the Royal has often managed this century. At one point in the ballroom, the 12 female Stars, one by one, rush back onstage, hitting the centerline with a sudden-death plunging step: a piquee penchee arabesque, in which the torso dives low, and then rears high while on point. At Covent Garden this is often fudged. Not so at Ballet Theater, where the 12 dancers really threw their torsos excitingly into the action."

Nick infected Jamie, and then Jamie infected Harry Ambrose -- or wait, was Harry infected all along? It's not a virus that these three characters are passing around on the USA series ""The Sinner,"" although they liken it to one. What has really taken them over are seductive, self-destructive Nietzschean concepts of embracing pain and flirting with death as pathways to higher truths. These notions have led Nick (Chris Messina) to stab himself with a steak knife, Jamie (Matt Bomer) to embark on a murder spree, and all three of them to consent to being buried alive (for a limited time). These dangerous games finally came to an end in Thursday night's Season 3 finale, in which Ambrose, played by Bill Pullman, shot Jamie because he was a metaphysical threat -- quoting Jung, talking about the unconscious, questioning fate. ""It's an impulsive moment that's surprising for Ambrose,"" Pullman said in a phone interview on Wednesday, ""almost as if he's rejecting this other side of himself."" From his home in Los Angeles, Pullman talked about his character's conflicts, about being buried alive and about having his dreams invaded by Keanu Reeves. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Why do you think Ambrose cries at the end? The detective and his suspect weren't exactly friends, but they did share a connection. Is he grieving? Maybe they shared the sense of what it's like to be lonely. I think Ambrose has been aware of his own sense of dislocation from other people. He's compelled to be more exposed about himself, yet he can't. So I think he finds something simpatico in Jamie, who has this ability to name things in the other person: ""I sense that there's something angry inside you."" Jamie represents his shadow self, and Ambrose's resistance to acknowledging that keeps him from real change. He's comfortable with the agony that he knows. My brother, who is an infectious disease doctor, said that some people would rather choose their dysfunction that is causing them ill health versus the unknown, healthier behavior, because there is an entrenched fear of the unknown. Harry's also responding to how much fear Jamie has at the end. Jamie didn't think that would be what he discovered on the edge. He didn't go into some kind of state of serenity, the way Nick did when he was dying. So Harry is grieving for that bizarre condition of how we think we can make death something calming, but in the moment, we're terrified. Part of Nick's philosophy -- as practiced by Jamie -- is that you need to shake people out of their comfort zones, disrupt their routines. He would have a field day right now. Nietzsche said that the earth is like an organism with a skin, stretched thinly around the world, and this skin can get diseases from time to time. And one of the diseases that it has is humanity! So his writing is full of darkness about who we are, as a collective organism.

With previous seasons of ""The Sinner,"" the people who have committed crimes are victims of trauma. But this season, Jamie is very much like Ambrose, and there's something dark inside them that seems to be a priori -- a given, not something that can be explained, or apologized for, or looked at to see if it can be corrected. There's some kind of self-loathing in the two of them, and it's dangerous. The two of them become burial buddies. What was it like shooting that when Ambrose agrees to be buried alive? I didn't trust it at first. I didn't believe I could get Ambrose to the point where he'd make that choice. [The showrunner] Derek Simonds, to his credit, kept shaping it, so there wasn't a lot of other recourse to help Ambrose build the case. Then add his sense of eminent danger, his conflicted empathy, his frustration. Once that got solved, it was the physical challenge. It's like an astronaut going into space. Just before launch, their heart rates are not much higher than we would experience making a left-hand turn into L.A. traffic. You prep to be in control and not panic.

How did you use creative dream work this season? This was an option offered to you back in Season 1, but this was the first season you participated in that process with the rest of the cast, right? There's a very Jungian approach to what Derek does. Derek had a three-day workshop before we started the pilot, and I didn't feel it was important to Ambrose at that point. Now I trust Derek in such a different way than I did three years ago, so this season, I did it. It was amazingly useful. Part of my fear going into it was that I don't remember my dreams. But [the coach, Kim Gillingham,] suggested I think about the possibility that if I have a dream, I'd like to remember it. And bang! I had a Technicolor dream.

What happened in the dream? I hadn't been to the shooting location yet, but it looked like Harry's house in the woods. I followed a 5-year-old girl wearing a tiara out to a pond next to the house, and she started to walk right into the pond. I went into the pond, too. Both of us were fully clothed. And there were two ducks at the far side of the pond watching us. I never dream about other actors or anything like that, but Keanu Reeves was also there, and I couldn't figure that out. Why was he in my dream? And then I remembered that Keanu had a very interesting response to a question in the past year, when Stephen Colbert asked him, ""What do you think happens when we die?"" Keanu took a breath, and then he said, pretty slowly, ""I know that the ones who love us will miss us."" It was something about his demeanor, the profundity and the simplicity of his response. So I think that was why, because those issues about facing death are part of this season. Parsing all of that the next day was particularly valuable. It was like a crack of lightning over a dark valley -- I could see the valley for what it was. How so? And how did it affect your performance? Everything you see is also something seeing you back. What are the ducks to you when they look back at you? So you start seeing this invitation to spontaneity, to be more playful, to be more willing to take this sense of connection to Harry's journey. The girl is a reflection of some aspect of Harry. It brought a kind of heightened awareness. That was powerful in the framework, the fear of being seen that has always been part of Harry's natural state. ""The Sinner"" invited you into the writers room to help incorporate aspects of your personal life into the story in Seasons 1 and 2. Anything in Season 3? In Season 2, we incorporated aspects of how my mother had a psychiatric illness and the consequences of unintentional abandonment. By this season, there was also Ambrose's biophilia, I call it -- the love of living things. The writers all know I have an exotic fruit orchard, so Derek said: ""We slugged in this stuff. What would he say?"" I used my own experience for the nursery scene where he's like: ""Don't choose these. These are root-bound."" Planting the tree with Jamie is intimate. It allows them to get to the place where they can talk candidly. Greil Marcus once wrote an essay called ""Bill Pullman's Face,"" describing your face as its own landscape, a window opening into America as a ""nihilist kingdom."" He said you look pushed down by the weight of a world that looks just as it did yesterday but no longer makes any sense. [Laughs] Interesting. A recurring series does give incredible permission to recognize that there is so much more that can be seen, even when you're not talking, you know? I was just talking to Derek about that. I said to him, ""There seem to be a lot of people who enjoy not being told things verbally but sensing them in the stretches of silence."" Choosing takes is a matter of deciding when the subtext is enough. But the subtext is not just one color. Sometimes it's the opposite, in the same moment."
11918,A Relieved Tour de France Has the Finish in Sight,The world's most prestigious cycling race may prove that sprawling sports events can be held amid a pandemic. But there's still a week to go.,"Slovenia's Primoz Roglic of Jumbo-Visma, left, has worn the leader's yellow jersey for the last week.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/15/sports/15tourdefrance3/merlin_176959758_a6a023aa-4e9d-4fe2-9b31-1776ac2d6352-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=977a6f2c46bbdc3c22bb87550cc00453ecba7a7566819baaf6661728deceefd2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/sports/cycling/tour-de-france-testing-roglic.html,ca0b0234-94a0-5449-a1cd-d537d5dea50e.jpg,"The Tour de France embarked on its final week on Tuesday, with more than 500 miles of racing left and only 40 seconds separating the leader from his closest pursuer. The field has already covered 15 stages, racked up nearly 1,650 miles and lost 20 cyclists, none of them to the coronavirus, despite early concerns that the race could trigger new waves of infections in a country that has seen a surge of cases in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the Tour announced that 785 more tests -- conducted on Sunday and Monday on riders, staff members of the 22 teams and race officials -- all had come back negative. It has not exactly been business as usual, however. Fans of the Tour have been scarcer on the sides of the road, and selfies and autographs are forbidden. Riders put on masks as soon as they cross the finish line, and operate in a restricted environment, though that has not been foolproof: Last week, Christian Prudhomme, the race's director, tested positive for the coronavirus, along with a few team staff members.

But for the most part, the stringent protocols put in place to keep the 2020 edition safe appear to be working. And in the absence of virus drama, much of the attention has been directed toward those excelling -- or struggling -- on their bikes. Slovenia's Primoz Roglic of Team Jumbo-Visma is leading the race, but his good friend and countryman Tadej Pogacar of Team Emirates is only 40 seconds behind after winning a mountain stage on Sunday. Germany's Lennard Kamna won Tuesday's 16th stage, well ahead of the leaders, who -- protected by their teammates -- kept close watch on one another from the relative safety of the front of the main pack.

With six stages left before the race's arrival on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday, Roglic and Pogacar will take their fight for the yellow jersey into the French Alps this week, including on a much-anticipated stage on Wednesday with a harrowing mountain climb to the finish near the ski resort town of Meribel that has never appeared on the Tour's route. ""It's unprecedented,"" Prudhomme said about the Col de la Loze. Many expect the fate of this year's Tour to be sealed there.

Pogacar said this week that his strategy would be to try to close the gap on Roglic in the mountains and then try to take the yellow jersey in a time trial on Saturday. He finished ahead of Roglic at the Slovenian time trial championships earlier this year, beat him in a sprint to the line on Sunday and then tried -- and failed -- to do it again on Tuesday. ""The perfect scenario would be to take it on the evening of the final time trial but we live in a real world,"" Pogacar said. ""If there's a chance to take it, I will try.""

""There are riders that are stronger than me, and we need to accept it,"" Bernal told journalists on Sunday. ""I had no power,"" he added. ""I haven't had the legs."" Still, Bernal, the first Colombian (and the first South American) to win the Tour, said he would give his best out of respect for the race. On Sunday, he posted a picture of himself wincing in pain on his Twitter account. ""Long live to the Tour,"" he wrote in French.

The Tour de France was initially scheduled for July, but delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Organizers have tried to maintain this year's edition by keeping the racers in a so-called bubble, with every rider required to wear face masks before and after each stage, and staff members ordered to do the same even as they ride together in the cars that accompany the peloton."
60436,Advice on Debt? Europe Suggests U.S. Can Keep It,The United States has long been considered a financial adviser to the rest of the world — until now.,"Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, center,  in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday to meet with European finance ministers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/17/business/global/17euro-sub/17euro-sub-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=330&w=600&s=0791380012cb0f93118efdeca6bad261ba70d72ca3f0f5c53011bdda14ae58ab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/business/global/europeans-struggle-to-clear-hurdles-to-latest-euro-rescue-plan.html,c77e3d52-711f-5485-8fee-360c1b4e4f9b.jpg,"WROCLAW, Poland -- The United States has long been considered a financial adviser to the rest of the world. But these days, American officials come carrying baggage. Financial officials from the United States, once called ""the committee to save the world"" after the Asian crisis in the 1990s, now find themselves uttering apologies for the harm caused to the world by the 2008 financial crisis and coating their advice to European nations with the knowing nod of the battle-hardened. The change in tone was on display here on Friday when Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner made an unusual appearance at a meeting of euro zone finance ministries. Mr. Geithner had been invited to offer some advice on fixing Europe's sovereign debt and banking problems. European leaders, who have been slow to react to the root causes of the problem, emerged from the meeting dismissive of Mr. Geithner's ideas and, in some cases, even of the idea that the United States was in a position to give out such pointers.

""I found it peculiar that, even though the Americans have significantly worse fundamental data than the euro zone, that they tell us what we should do,"" Maria Fekter, the finance minister of Austria, said after the meeting Friday morning. ""I had expected that, when he tells us how he sees the world, that he would listen to what we have to say."" Such criticism was echoed by other attendees of the meeting, including the finance minister of Belgium, Didier Reynders, who said Mr. Geithner should listen rather than talk. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the finance minister group, said European officials did not care to have detailed discussions about expanding their bailout fund ""with a nonmember of the euro area."" American officials are aware that they need to tread carefully when advising others, especially now, and they have avoided offering specific plans or proposals. Instead, they point to recent programs in the United States simply as case studies. On Friday, Mr. Geithner, among other recommendations, encouraged the European leaders to add more firepower to their bailout funds, and described how the United States used leverage in 2008 to help bolster the markets. The Treasury department said in a statement Friday that ""Secretary Geithner encouraged his European counterparts to act decisively and to speak with one voice."" And a Treasury official said the department did not feel Mr. Geithner was rebuffed, because he did not have a specific agenda.

In the past, countries with financial problems have not always received the United States' advice with open arms, at least until they needed financial support. Europe, analysts say, may never need outside support if its political leaders can find a way to use the wealth of nations like Germany to shore up more debt-troubled countries like Italy. Still, it is hard to argue that the United States is not in a far weaker place to be doling out advice than it was in past crises, especially after the gridlock in August over raising the debt limit. ""We're in a very different world environment right now,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. ""The United States has diminished credibility -- it can't simply tell Europe what to do. And it lacks the political will or means to throw a lot of cash at European troubles, even though they could become American problems very quickly."" It was unusual for Mr. Geithner to attend an internal meeting of the 17 financial ministers from European Union countries that use the euro. The meeting was held on the first of two days of talks in Poland, and so far European finance ministers are no closer to overcoming the hurdles holding up the plan they developed for Greece back in July. Mr. Geithner did not offer up a fully developed plan or urge one particular action. According to an American official who was not authorized to comment publicly, the Treasury secretary urged Europe to send a strong message to the market by putting up a large enough sum of money to support its debt-ridden nations and banks. He suggested that could be done through the use of borrowed money, as the United States did in some programs in 2008. One program, known as TALF, was meant to revive lending in the consumer and small-business markets. ""If you show the market that you have what it takes to stand behind your banks and stand behind your sovereigns, it will cost less in the end,"" said Lael Brainard, under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury. Some Europeans have expressed ideas similar to Mr. Geithner's for a broader rescue plan. Still, the United States faces a different sort of audience when giving ideas to Europe than it does when facing officials in developing economies.

""In the 1990s, there were lots of countries that would say, that's working in the United States, how can we copy that?"" said Gary Gensler, who worked at the Treasury in the 1990s and now leads the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ""We're still very much the leader in financial regulations and in the financial markets, but the 2008 crisis showed we failed. Our financial regulatory system failed and Wall Street failed."" Some policy makers say the United States might even be wise to turn to China as a partner in persuasion. ""Maybe this should be a joint effort,"" said Sheila C. Bair, a senior advisor at the Pew Charitable Trusts, who was the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation until this summer. She said it would be helpful for China and the United States to give European leaders the same message. But, she said, referring to the United States' financial crisis in 2008, ""we certainly don't have clean hands in all this."" Countries with financial problems do not want outside advice until they need outside money, said Jeffrey Shafer, who was the under secretary for international issues at the Treasury in the 1990s. ""There are different stages in this process, and Europe right now is kind of in a halfway house,"" he said. ""The reality is that you get more influence when you are providing support."" It would be difficult for the Obama administration to persuade Congress to give loans to Europe, analysts say, but there are other options. The Federal Reserve can open its discount window to European banks or, as it has already done, it can use foreign exchange lines. The Treasury could also lend out money from a facility that helps with exchange-rate problems. Or the United States could promote additional aid from the International Monetary Fund. Even if the United States offered more aid, it is unclear if Europe would want it. Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who has worked with Mr. Geithner, said the United States had questions to answer, too. ""It's not just a question of being the scolding school teacher,"" he said. ""Geithner will also have to give a convincing story that we're dealing with our problems."""

Persephone Books in London -- devoted mostly to overlooked works by female writers in the mid-1900s -- celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.



LONDON -- Lamb's Conduit Street seems almost too adorable to be real, as if Ye Olde Fantasy Englande, the one that exists in your head, had suddenly sprung to life. But it feels exactly right that this cobblestone thoroughfare in Bloomsbury, filled as it is with idiosyncratic shops selling artisanal cheese and homemade cakes and other rarefied items, should also be home to Persephone Books, a gem of a place devoted mostly to overlooked works by female writers of the mid-20th century. Walking into the shop feels for a moment like walking back in time. Vintage posters exhort wartime women to, for instance, Join the Wrens, the British women's naval service. But the present is here, too. In the window is a blowup of Senator Mitch McConnell's ill-tempered remarks about Senator Elizabeth Warren in 2017, using language that sounds decidedly ""Jane Eyre""-ish: ""She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.""

Here you will find books by women you have probably never heard of, like Oriel Malet and Isobel English, and some who might be more familiar, like Katherine Mansfield and Frances Hodgson Burnett. (There are even a few men on the shelves.) You'll also find, in pride of place, ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for A Day,"" a 1938 novel by Winifred Watson that was brought to Persephone's attention by a customer who said it had been her mother's favorite book. Published by Persephone in 2000, the book -- about a poor, drab governess mistakenly sent by her employment agency to work for a glamorous nightclub singer -- became an unexpected hit for the company, was made into a movie and has been a consistently buoyant seller ever since.

Each year perhaps a half-dozen more books join the list, so that there are now 132 in all. All are still in print, and all are still for sale, each for a flat 13 pounds (if you're ordering from the United States, they're $20 apiece); every time the new titles arrive, the old books are moved a bit and the shelves reorganized to make way. After a few seasons as just a publisher, Persephone became a bookstore, too, leaving its old office in Clerkenwell and expanding into its current space. It is both office and shop, one purpose blending into the other across two rooms. Overall, the shop's most popular author is a woman named Dorothy Whipple, who has an impressive 10 books on the list, Persephones No. 3, 19, 40, 56, 74, 85, 95, 110, 118, and 127. Her books are funny and spirited and full of insight about real people's lives at the time. ""I like books that tell me how we lived,"" Beauman said. ""I'm very, very interested in the novel as social history."" Also, she said: ""Good writing is important to me, and that's why we only have 132 books.""

Persephone has a devoted and passionate following. Some 30,000 people subscribe to its free magazine, The Persephone Biannually, which includes articles about the newest books and other subjects. Its website contains Beauman's own wittily erudite musings, which lately have taken an alarmed tone because of uncertainty over the fate of small businesses during the protracted debacle that is Brexit, or Britain's exit from the European Union. Last month, the company celebrated its 20th anniversary with smoked-salmon sandwiches, tea, Champagne and cake in an all-day party with a steady streams of visitors giving way to a larger crowd at night. ""The idea at the beginning was that if you like one of our books, you'll like them all,"" Beauman said. ""That has worked almost entirely. It's quite rare for someone to dislike any of the books. I hate to use the word brand, but we are something of a brand."""

34566,What Surfing With My Niece Taught Me About Life,"Turns out that in surfing, as in life, fear of falling can lead to more falls.","The author, Steven Petrow, surfing in Hawaii.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/17/well/voices-surf/voices-surf-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cc9ae3ef5fb692a5e594b3fc25a2a027cd21118cb191f3bbf3e14a1bfe727267&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/well/what-surfing-with-my-niece-taught-me-about-life.html,6139a5b6-0d1a-569f-a889-e8ac1eb7a5bf.jpg,"I spent two hours last month falling flat on my face (or back), at least a dozen times. These weren't minor trips and stumbles -- in fact, I wiped out repeatedly, spectacularly, in front of my family and even a photographer. I was surfing in the salty seas off Kailua-Kona on Hawaii's Big Island, where my sister, brother and their spouses and kids had come to recover from a rough year that included the death of our parents, my sister's cancer diagnosis and the placing of my brother's autistic son in a home. We were determined to celebrate our resiliency and newfound hope. As a bonus, I realized that many of the lessons I learned on the waves could be translated for use on dry land. The first time I tested my mettle on a Hawaiian long board, I was 32 and fearless -- perfect attributes for catching oversize waves and experiencing long, exhilarating runs (as well as mash-ups with underwater coral and rough-hewed lava rocks). I loved the rush of adrenaline each run unleashed, fueling the desire to take on more and bigger waves. Surfing at 60 -- after a 15-year hiatus -- was, frankly, more of a challenge. When I took my first surfing lessons in 1989, my body's muscles had an elasticity that made it almost effortless to ""pop up"" (that's when you move from lying prone on the board to crouching on it, butt out and back flat). I could see that very same elasticity in my 21-year-old niece, Jessie, a surfing novice, as she jumped up time and again to catch a wave. Her legs had a natural spring to them, and in a flash she'd be in the Warrior 2 position, shimmying down the wave, braids flying out behind her.

I know my hips and glutes have tightened over the decades, but it really wasn't my body that kept getting in the way as I crashed off the board. Our instructor, Ossian (pronounced ""Ocean"") Farmer, owner and operator of FBI Surf School, pointed out how I kept hesitating -- that, more than any loss of flexibility, he said, was what was holding me back. That certainly resonated. In my youth I had had few hesitations. I was a Malcolm Gladwell ""Blink"" kind of guy: I could commit to a wave, a job, a partner, and never look back. Now on the board I found myself dragging one foot like an anchor caught on a rock (and yes, I recognized the metaphor).  ""The moment you hesitate in surfing is the moment you will find yourself in trouble,"" I read on SurferToday.com. You will lose momentum; you will miss the wave; you will likely wipe out. Or, as Mr. Farmer put it to me: ""Hesitation is totally the enemy. If you're not fully committed, you're history."" Jessie concurred, saying it wasn't physical ability or even her youth that gave her an edge. ""It's not a strength thing,"" she said. ""You have to be in your own body and have the intuition of knowing when to stand up."" Jessie has lived through much of our family tumult with me and knows a thing or two already about being able to stand up at the right time. Surfing well, my teacher told me between my wipeouts, is a lot like meditation. ""It's like not thinking,"" he said, ""you're just in the moment."" For the next several waves after he told me that I tried out a surfing mantra, similar to what I use to stay focused during meditation. ""Eyes forward. Knees relaxed. Feet parallel. Core tight."" But in the rush and flush of a wave, I got lost in my words and wiped out.

I simplified my mantra to ""Jessie,"" since her wave riding captured all those reminders. To my surprise, I caught the very next wave and made it halfway to shore. I had stopped thinking and was -- actually -- in the moment. As Jessie put it to me: ""There's an element of risk each time you get up because there's always a chance that you'll fall. But do you have the trust, the willingness to take the leap when you don't know the specified conditions each time?"" Watching my niece, I noticed something else. Jess kept her eye on the prize, which on the board means looking straight ahead to the shore. I realized that even when I did pop up properly, my focus often wandered to the left or right and I'd quickly tumble off the board. ""Look straight ahead,"" my instructor shouted over the breaking surf. He kept reminding me not to get sidetracked. I couldn't help but think of the many times distraction had undermined me, personally and professionally, by tempting my focus away from the goal. In 21 years, Jess has learned many things, but I do have a few decades of experience on her. My siblings and I have lived through some difficult times and have gotten a bit too familiar with illness, disability, death and fear. In the years since I'd last surfed, I had watched my aged parents fall and hurt themselves many times, and I'd developed a fear of falling. My brother and sister-in-law had also faced their own trials over those years, notably raising their son who has autism, who is both lovable and a huge challenge. Mr. Farmer, who's surfed since he was in third grade, admitted to some fears of his own, but was philosophical about them. ""Don't let fear get in the way of living your dreams. It will handicap you,"" he said. ""Usually fear holds you back and creates anxiety. You should pretty much ignore it"" -- although he quickly pointed out he wasn't encouraging me to be a daredevil and ride a giant wave beyond my ability. ""But what do I do when I tumble?"" I asked. ""Fall flat,"" he advised, which would keep me from getting scraped by any lava rocks. ""Don't dive head first. And be as graceful as you can."" (With a beachside photographer capturing every fall, I tried for grace, but I laughed when I looked at the photos.) When it came time for the last wave, I deployed all of my surfing mentor's advice, as well as my own experience. I popped up. I did a ""Jessie"" and caught the wave, surfing it all the way to the shore. Exhilarating. And then I fell -- flat -- since I didn't know any other way to get off the board. My brother's wife, who witnessed this magnificent ride, had the last word of the morning after my head bobbed up from underneath the surf: ""The next step after falling,"" she said -- learned as much from her life experience as from times on the board -- ""is getting up again.""

He's a character in the new series ""Godfather of Harlem,"" beginning Sunday on Epix, and he's just delivered a succinct review of it. The show's central trinity -- Johnson the gangster, Powell the congressman and Baptist pastor and Malcolm X the Muslim minister and revolutionary -- are played by Forest Whitaker, Giancarlo Esposito and Nigel Thatch. And the main pleasure ""Godfather of Harlem"" affords, through five of its 10 episodes, is watching those actors go at it. Throw in a quirky performance by Vincent D'Onofrio as the mafia boss Vincent Gigante, Johnson's primary antagonist, and there's a high probability of entertainment at any given moment. The show around them, ""inspired by"" Johnson's life, doesn't consistently live up to its cast. It's part crime saga and part cultural-historical pantomime, jumbling together real people, places and events from early-1960s Harlem. The style is familiar from other New York TV dramas like ""The Get Down,"" ""Vinyl"" and ""The Deuce"" set in the recent past, and as often happens, the different elements end up working against one another. The action starts in 1963 with Johnson's release, in his late 50s, after an 11-year stretch at Alcatraz . He's welcomed by a party in the sleek and luxurious apartment his wife, Mayme (Ilfenesh Hadera), has secured for them in the Lenox Terrace high-rises, but he also gets bad news about the neighborhood's shifting fortunes: The Italian crime families are encroaching on the heroin trade, and the competition is driving up the number of junkies on the street.

The first episode, directed by John Ridley (""American Crime""), quickly and elegantly sketches out the show's themes. In a direct homage to the show's namesake, ""The Godfather,"" we see Johnson at the party alternately dispensing benevolent patronage and receiving quiet updates about weapons caches and the activities of ""the Italians."" He sneaks out and shares an ice cream with his daughter but immediately gets pulled back in, called away to deal with a violent situation on 146th Street. His new nemesis is Gigante, and one main strand of the plot is their escalating battle, carried out partly with guns but largely through insult-laden face-offs, in which Whitaker's reserve plays off D'Onofrio's eccentric volatility. More space is taken up, though, with the uncomfortable question of Johnson's role in the community, and his twinges of guilt over the damage done by the heroin he peddles. The story is arranged so that he bounces between Powell, who treats him with breezy condescension, and Malcolm X, who confronts him with scolding righteousness. Both decry the effects of his drugs, but both are happy to use him for their own political or personal gain. And Johnson conducts his business in a kind of dark parallel to theirs, organizing the community in his own way and engaging in what's essentially a race war with Gigante and his crew. It's a promising setup, but the show doesn't build on it after the opening episode. The story starts to veer off into tangents that are melodramatic (a fairly insipid Romeo and Juliet subplot involving Gigante's daughter), distractingly implausible (an episode built around attempts to fix a Cassius Clay fight) or both (a family member of Johnson's caught up in drugs and prostitution). Each of these plot strands tries to tie together all of show's big issues -- race, drugs, family, the radical ferment of the '60s -- and the effort is as exhausting for the audience as it must have been for the writers. (The show's creators, Chris Brancato and Paul Eckstein of ""Narcos,"" wrote the first four episodes.) The tone tends to be restrained and talky, but there are regular doses of more sensationalistic material, like a recurring blaxploitation-style character named Big Dick Buster who has a distinctive way of getting information out of male captives.

Through it all, Whitaker keeps a tight rein on his performance, letting his storied intensity break through in just a few flashes. His portrayal is more smoothly imposing than it is interesting, at least through half of the season -- maybe we'll get a clearer sense of Johnson's demons in later episodes. Part of the problem might be that unlike James Gandolfini or Bryan Cranston in earlier iterations, he has to play the criminal antihero with an overlay of racially determined pride and guilt. Esposito, as the suavely amoral Powell, and D'Onofrio, as the unapologetically racist Gigante, don't have such constraints, and their performances are correspondingly both more relaxed and more nuanced. They, along with Luis Guzman as an associate of Johnson's, Paul Sorvino as Frank Costello, Antoinette Crowe-Legacy as a heroin addict and others in the large cast, are a reason to stick with ""Godfather of Harlem."" Another is nostalgia, with the high-production values dedicated to recreations of one-time neighborhood institutions like Twenty Two West, Eddie's Sweet Shop and the record store Bobby's Happy House. And of course the music, with great, off-the-beaten-track selections like Little Anthony's ""I'm on the Outside"" and Barrett Strong's ""Misery."" In the opening scene, Johnson drives by the Apollo and asks, who's this James Brown? It seems likely that we'll get to see the answer."
40631,"Why the Whitney's Humanist, Pro-Diversity Biennial Is a Revelation",This much-anticipated show displays a strength and focus doubly important when art and the humanities seem under attack in Washington.,"Samara Golden's ""The Meat Grinder's Iron Clothes"" (2017).",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/17/arts/17BIENNIAL1/17BIENNIAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3057e62ee626711fa79f4cbfc2cb03552ecf264ab4a0bb0580c15686e30f4b30&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/arts/design/why-the-whitneys-humanist-pro-diversity-biennial-is-a-revelation.html,18b23e5c-52b8-5312-9954-1dec00614e79.jpg,"Since moving downtown, the Whitney Museum of American Art has grown up, thanks to a larger, dashing new building, more ambitious exhibitions and new responsibilities brought by rising attendance and membership. No surprise, its biennial has grown up, too. Perhaps less expected: So has the art in it. This show's strength and focus make it doubly important at a time when art, the humanities and the act of thinking itself seem under attack in Washington. The 2017 Biennial, the first held in the expansive Renzo Piano-designed structure on Gansevoort Street, is an adult affair: spatially gracious to art and visitors alike, and exceptionally good looking, with an overall mood of easy accessibility. My first thought: It needs a little more edge. Yet this show navigates the museum's obligations to a broader public and its longtime art-world audience with remarkable success. Organized by Christopher Y. Lew, the Whitney's associate curator, and Mia Locks, an independent curator, it has some immature inclusions and other letdowns. But once you really start looking, there's edge all over the place. The show spotlights 63 artists and collectives working at the intersection of the formal and the social, and in this it announces a new chapter of so-called political art -- though one already brewing in small museums, galleries and studios. Many of these artists confront such American realities as income inequality, homelessness, misogyny, immigration, violence, hatred and biases of race, religion and class. But they are equally committed to the artistic exploration of media and materials, and to the creation of bold and strange things to see and think about. Important messages are conveyed through perception. Take Henry Taylor's gripping history painting of Philando Castile dying in the passenger seat of his car in a St. Paul suburb, having just been shot by a policeman whose gun, arm and uniform are visible through the car window. We are inside the car, in the driver's seat, bearing witness with Diamond Reynolds, Mr. Castile's girlfriend, as she live-streams his mortal injury on a cellphone. Mr. Castile, a school cafeteria manager, has the noble head of a Greek bronze, complete with a jawline beard and an eye whose flat whites the Greeks would have made from silver or alabaster inlay. His shirt is spattered with paint, not blood. Mr. Taylor's style is harsh but it doesn't overplay.

Samara Golden's ""The Meat Grinder's Iron Clothes"" is a dystopian combination of mirrors and eight half-size miniature interiors -- including some upside down -- that create endless kaleidoscopic reflections of class conflict. Overlooking the Hudson River, it includes a drab office full of computer stations, an all-white aspirational Upper East Side living room and some merging of high-end hospital and prison featuring pink wheelchairs and filthy toilets. The melding of pleasure and horror it can elicit would have delighted Georges Bataille, the radical philosopher for whom ""truth has only one face: that of a violent contradiction."" This Biennial follows the lead of Kerry James Marshall's painting retrospective at the Met Breuer last fall, which set a high standard for social engagement sustained by formal ambition. This presentation is also an important bookend to the 1993 Biennial, a raucous, untidy show unforgettable for the real-life issues it threw in viewers' faces -- and for often overly didactic, hectoring and visually dry art. The current Biennial reflects the emergence of artists committed to political subject matter but unwilling to limit themselves artistically or to lecture viewers. Mr. Marshall, who presides here in absentia, has lots of company. Some of the breathtaking openness and diversity of contemporary art is evident in this show's participants and its range of media -- from painting, which is plentiful and mostly but not entirely figurative, to digital and virtual-reality art. Nearly half are female, and half nonwhite; its demographics argue that not only do black lives matter (along with Hispanic, Asian, Muslim and immigrant lives), they are essential to our quality of life -- physical, emotional, cultural, linguistic, economic, educational, environmental. The show is promising from the start, in the lobby, which is festooned with 10 opulently embroidered and appliqued banners by Cauleen Smith, a Chicago artist whose work is also in the film program. Serious yet melodramatic, they contrast statements of stark deprivation (""I Cannot Be Fixed"") with images of exposed hearts; weapons; burning eight balls; broken pencils; and a large, injured eye, conjuring faith, superstition, violence and thwarted expression.

On the Hudson side of the sixth floor, Jessi Reaves's alternately raw and beautiful hybrids of found furniture and sculpture provide both seating and ingenious commentaries on design, modernism and waste. Their snarling energy is matched by their neighbors: the creepy coagulations of color, plastic, resin, drawing and grommets that form the paintings of KAYA, a collaboration consisting of the artists Kerstin Bratsch and Debo Eilers. Some artists approach the unvarnished bluntness of the 1993 Biennial, with complexity. ""A Very Long Line"" -- a four-channel video installation by the collective Postcommodity involving blurry images of tall fences shot from a moving car -- takes over the walls of a small gallery, capturing the viewer in a noisily rattling cage. When you learn that the fences are on the Mexican border, the piece becomes a visceral metaphor for the experience of feeling, or being, trapped, that is now the fate of so many undocumented immigrants.

It's a working classroom, set up by the Puerto Rican artist Chemi Rosado-Seijo to serve students of the Lower Manhattan Arts Academy on the Lower East Side.

25963,The Nightlife Outlaws of East Los Angeles,"Club Scum, a monthly party that embraces punk and drag, is a distillation of the fringe-friendly gay underground on the Eastside.","Josefina Valdez, an original attendee of Club Scum nights, in downtown Los Angeles.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/fashion/THELOOK-CLUBSCUM5/THELOOK-CLUBSCUM5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=523&w=1000&s=3dd3fb3dad4863d38e69cb02376182563ab528544fa637b527291032909a55bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/style/the-nightlife-outlaws-of-east-los-angeles.html,62cdaba7-6173-5125-a05d-aa96137b99c4.jpg,"Let's get one thing straight, so to speak. There's mainstream gay club culture -- homogeneous house music, international circuit parties, rainbow flags everywhere, which is fine! -- and there is underground gay club culture, which is more like a spider web of alternative scenes. The underground reflects themes and identities, as well as literal geographies, that are usually marginalized, or are, in a word, ""queer."" In Los Angeles in early 2016, two queer club denizens put a party together at a strip-mall gay bar in deeply Latino eastern Los Angeles and called it Club Scum. Far from the posher dance floors of the gay enclave of West Hollywood, the goal of the organizers was to mix scenes that hadn't often met, even on the widest of webs: drag and punk. They were nervous. ""The first Scum, yeah, some people were leaving, and the manager was worried,"" said one of the co-founders, Rudy ""Rudy Bleu"" Garcia, referring to their venue , Club Chico in Montebello, Calif.

More than three years later, this monthly party featuring art and drag performances, D.J.s, go-go dancers and sometimes live punk bands, has become a staple of underground East L.A. night life. The mixture has worked, its founders said, because Scum spoke to a cultural current that was hiding right before them. ""For us, it's just fun to play X Ray Specs and then Banda Machos, or like, Gloria Trevi to the Germs,"" said Mr. Garcia, 41, referring to the sounds of Scum playlists, but also to the musical styles that might echo against one another across city streets in East L.A.

Dress is central to Scum's subculture. The club's adherents show up reflecting all kinds of alternative styles, often with a gender-bending or drag bent. Body positivity is functionally boundless. Extravagant face makeup is a norm. Prosthetics are encouraged. On a recent night in September, the latest Scum night at Chico was going strong. The music and vibe veered -- seamlessly -- from New Wave, to techno, to traditional Mexican ranchera to hard-core punk. A few people approached me and said they'd never seen me there before, just as a regular said might happen. Inclusivity reigns at Club Scum. I smiled and embraced strangers, informing them that, yes, I was a party virgin. ""Scum is that place where you can be your true authentic weird self,"" said Mr. Sanchez, 30, and I knew exactly what he meant. In a way, I'd been to this party, in some form, many times before.

I had a pretty great time living in Los Angeles in my 20s in the mid-2000s. It was in its last few years in the ranks of megacities that were considered underrated, and, for its sheer vastness, Los Angeles felt like a place where wonderlands for any fancy beckoned from behind discreetly marked doors. There was always something going on, always another room to peek into, always another entrance. In that decade, L.A. was the city of secrets. I was convinced that in order to really understand the place, I had to get to know as many distinct night life scenes as possible. After dark, I got in my car and went out. I plunged into the neighborhoods that radiate from downtown, hurtling into backyard ska-punk shows in El Sereno, experimental art happenings in Chinatown, and smoky trip-hop after-hours in warehouses in South-Central. Most of all, I was at the underground gay club nights.

In L.A.'s central neighborhoods and its Eastside, denizens followed the underground gay calendar from club to club, week to week, where we made bands of friends and notched strings of enthusiastic bed mates. There wasn't a lot of overthinking going on; labels weren't in style. Maybe this was because the period came right after the vibrating trauma of Sept. 11, but also well before dating apps, necessitating analog contact with strangers in order to have a life in a driving-heavy metropolis. The corresponding flow was fluid and bent slightly toward the nihilistic in everything from music to sexual practices to street fashion. As a result, it's taken me some years to realize that there were actually two alternative gay underground cultures in Los Angeles at the time, and that many of us had firm footholds in both. There were the more mainstream-adjacent scenes that centered in East Hollywood and Silver Lake: leather, bears, rockers, ""creative"" types, the people who congregated at places like Akbar, MJ's, the Eagle, Cuffs and Faultline. Then there was the immigrant-led underground, dominated by working class gays and lesbians, Latin drag queens, trans people . These venues included the old Le Bar on Glendale Boulevard (now the hipster haunt Cha Cha Lounge), the now-defunct Circus Disco in Hollywood, the divey New Jalisco on Main Street, and Tempo on Santa Monica Boulevard, a veritable club of worship to gay vaqueros and queens.

Farther east, there was the little known lesbian bar Reds in Boyle Heights, and Club Chico, a ""cholo bar,"" as we called it back then, that catered mostly to Mexican or Mexican-American guys who shunned the traditional L.G.B.T. identifiers but could definitely be described as ""men who have sex with men."" Being a gay underground clubgoer in L.A. at the time meant almost by default being some shade of brown. Nearly half of the county's population was already Latino, but it was a time, almost two decades before Latinx entered the dictionary , when the city was weirdly un-self-aware about it. Everyone was just mixed in. The deeper I got into downtown and the Eastside, the weirder and freer things would get. Which is why, when I first entered a Club Scum night in Los Angeles in 2019, I knew, in club-going terms, that I had effectively returned home.

For the misfits, the outcasts, the night crawlers, it works. ""Scum provides a space for people to be themselves, and take risks, and try new things with the way they dress, perform, communicate,"" Mr. Garcia said. ""And to meet other people who are like you, and are not just trying to fetishize you for being brown or for being punk."" Mr. Sanchez added: ""It's been nice to bring people to our gay bar, in the hood, where we grew up."" Daniel Jack Lyons is a photographer who divides his time between New York and Los Angeles.

145,The Insanity of Trump's Wine Tariffs,He wants to punish Europe — but thousands of American businesses will suffer instead.,"A vineyard in Burgundy, France.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/05/opinion/05lefcourt1/merlin_162155886_98036cba-1070-49fa-af5a-d944fe09cb09-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a4b400b5f4ef9f681e8007f09f585e10e5d6775c8bd10db1296843a389fc02ff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/opinion/wine-tariff-trump.html,bb9b7b0b-05d4-5f2b-9cd5-96ee7a27640f.jpg,"He wants to punish Europe -- but thousands of American businesses will suffer instead.

I have spent 20 years building a wine-import company. On Jan. 14, the Trump administration could destroy it all by imposing a 100 percent tariff on European wine. Mine is not the only American business that would suffer. The United States imports over $4.25 billion a year in European wine, which is handled by thousands of importers, distributors, wine stores and restaurants. In recent weeks we've all been scrambling to avoid disaster. We are sending emails and letters to clients, begging them to call their representatives in Congress. We are fighting not just to be able to drink European wine; we are fighting for our livelihoods and for our hundreds of thousands of employees. We have already been hurt by tariffs. In October -- a peak season for wine sales -- the government imposed a 25 percent tariff on French, Spanish and German wines, along with single-malt Scotch and other European food products. I and most of the other importers I know spent weeks on the phone negotiating with winemakers to keep working with us. Many of them wanted to walk away from the United States market; after all, these days demand from Asia is huge. We cut margins and raised prices as little as possible, all the while wasting precious time we would have normally devoted to trying to increase our sales.

Many American companies put the brakes on hiring and expansion plans, waiting to see if the tariff would come down after a few months. Instead, it's about to go much, much higher. Worse, the new tariff covers more products, including sparkling wine and wine over 14 percent alcohol content, categories that had been spared before. The purported reason for the tariffs is European financial support for the aerospace company Airbus, a major competitor of Boeing. The World Trade Organization declared that this support amounted to an unfair subsidy and in October approved retaliatory American tariffs on European luxury goods including cheese, olive oil, cashmere sweaters, handbags, cosmetics, spirits and wine. Tariffs do nothing to protect jobs. On the contrary, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has published a map showing how American businesses and consumers -- including those in areas whose elected officials loudly support these tariffs -- are already being harmed by a global trade war. You might think, ""Who cares if the price of European wine goes up? People can just buy domestic wines instead."" And they will. But in the process, the vast industry responsible for importing and selling billions of dollars in wine, whisky and other products from Europe will suffer -- especially small businesses with narrow profit margins. Investment will grind to a halt. People will lose jobs. Adding a new producer to our book from the Loire Valley? Not now! Ordering containers of wine? I'll wait to see if the tariffs go through.

Some of the winemakers in our portfolio are among the most sought after in the world, with limited capacity to expand. If they cannot sell to the United States, they will gladly go to China or Russia -- and if the tariffs ever go back down, we could find ourselves at the back of the line.

The wine industry is linked to other industries, like hospitality. Importing companies sell to wholesalers (which together employ 100,000 people), which sell to retail shops and restaurants (three million employees). Trucking, warehouse and shipping companies will all be affected. Office assistants, truck drivers, forklift operators, logistics coordinators, bookkeepers and restaurant chefs and servers could all see their jobs in peril. Full-service restaurants are a $179 billion industry. High-end restaurants that serve wine have done particularly well in the last five years, with wine sales making up for their losses on food. Likewise, wine and liquor stores are one of the few bright spots in the brick-and-mortar retail economy. They had an estimated total revenue of $61 billion in 2019, with a growing amount of that coming from high-end, imported beverages. No one I know would argue that the Trump administration is wrong to protect American industries by pushing back when it sees unfair practices by other countries. But tariffs make no sense -- if we insist on charging European winemakers more to sell their products in the United States, they will easily find another buyer. The only ones hurt will be American businesses and consumers. My company plans to celebrate its 20th anniversary on April 19. We had been hoping to have a big party. If the tariffs go through, my employees and I could instead find ourselves on the unemployment line, mourning the loss of our livelihood and the death of an industry that has brought much joy to the world.

41986,Coffee Shops Skip Wi-Fi to Encourage Customers to Actually Talk,A small number of cafes are promoting sociability over technology and productivity by denying customers access to Wi-Fi.,HotBlack Coffee in Toronto opened last year without Wi-Fi service for its customers.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/05/business/05HotCoffee3_xp/05HotCoffee3_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a9ead23cd558957102ef21e9e6b947e6ce776396524a5b991d4aa6da50b12fde&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/technology/coffee-shop-wifi-access.html,4e668a0d-8617-5f2d-941a-b3bc292ea40a.jpg,"At HotBlack Coffee, a cafe in downtown Toronto, you can get walnut butter squares, lemon poppy seed muffins, biscotti and, of course, coffee. But one thing you can't get there: Wi-Fi. Jimson Bienenstock, the president of HotBlack, said the shop opened last year without Wi-Fi with the express intent of getting customers to -- gasp! -- talk to one another instead of burying their faces in laptops. ""It's about creating a social vibe,"" he said. ""We're a vehicle for human interaction, otherwise it's just a commodity."" At many coffee outlets, workers set up makeshift offices and rely on the stores' Wi-Fi, which has come to be considered a given -- if not a right.

While HotBlack is not the first cafe to withhold Wi-Fi from the public, industry experts said such shops are in the minority and risk alienating customers. Mr. Bienenstock said he has traveled extensively, including 15 years of living in Europe, and found that the practice of setting up a temporary workplace in a cafe was largely confined to North America. He said he did not see his approach as revolutionary but as a response to society's deep immersion into all things digital that leads people to seldom communicate face to face. Customers initially were aghast at the decision. ""What do you mean you don't have Wi-Fi?"" was a common refrain, he said, adding that the camps are divided between those who love it and those who loathe it. (Only four of 28 reviews on Yelp noted the shop's lack of Wi-Fi.) HotBlack, which has seating for 58, gained the recent attention of the Canadian news media for its counterintuitive approach, with an article in The Globe and Mail and an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

""You'd have a hell of a time concentrating in our place because there's so much noise,"" he said. ""There's so many people talking to each other."" To promote conviviality, other shops have adopted a no-Wi-Fi policy and gone a step further: doing away with some comfy furniture and narrowing counters to make them less accommodating for laptops. Caroline Bell, co-owner of Cafe Grumpy, said it offers Wi-Fi only at its Greenpoint, Brooklyn, location, which has a larger space for customers who want to work, she wrote in an email. The cafe does not offer Wi-Fi at its seven other New York City locations. Alex M. Susskind, an associate professor of food and beverage management at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University, said he saw the lack of Wi-Fi as a detriment. Customers develop a ""habituated expectation"" and would be surprised not to have it. ""That kind of bucks the trend of what most people go to coffeehouses for,"" he said. A 2015 thesis by Rose K. Pozos about the ""urban sociability"" of coffee shops posited that sitting alone with a laptop in a cafe was not necessarily antisocial. ""People still chose to go there instead of being alone at home or work,"" wrote Ms. Pozos, who was a student at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pa., at the time of her thesis. ""This indicates that there is a social reason for people to go to coffee shops that does not involve direct interaction with others."""
39001,Death Is Inevitable. Financial Turmoil Afterward Isn't.,"Preparing for the death of a spouse or partner and its ramifications may be an unhappy task, but doing so can ease some avoidable financial sorrows.","Erika Lupo, whose husband, John, died of cancer last year at age 57, was better prepared than many widows. He did everything he could to prepare his estate and make sure his wife knew where his assets were.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/14/business/14Retiring-01/14Retiring-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4219c956afd91499298d15025aa012b3346d4cb5ceaed662ee0e9592bd8d6af5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/your-money/estate-planning-early.html,cf635fe6-6847-5b26-9ca7-0c380669def6.jpg,"MOST of us do not even want to contemplate the death of a spouse or partner -- much less the prospect of having to take care of the financial end of such a loss while still grieving. There are, however, plenty of details that people can attend to in advance that can avoid some measure of stress when the time comes. Most people tend to ignore or procrastinate over such tasks -- for obvious reasons -- but planning can certainly ease some avoidable financial sorrows. The first step to prepare for this unhappy life stage is to make sure both partners have a thorough understanding of the couple's spousal and individual assets and where they are. Are there life insurance policies? Do they name the right survivors as beneficiaries? What about pensions and other retirement plans? How will the money flow after someone's death? As all too many people find out too late, this sort of preparation should start well before either spouse becomes disabled or dies. The general principle is to protect the survivor and enable him or her to make decisions about the estate's assets.

One couple who went through this exercise, Erika and John Lupo of Sparta, N.J., did so sooner than most, and it paid off. When Mr. Lupo died of cancer last year at age 57, Ms. Lupo, 51, who runs an acting school, was extraordinarily well prepared -- unlike many widows. In his final days, Mr. Lupo, a former salesman, did everything he could to prepare his estate and make sure his wife knew where his assets were -- and how they could be bequeathed to her and heirs.

Working with Mark Germain, a certified financial planner with Beacon Wealth Management in Hackensack, N.J., Mr. Lupo had several documents in order just a few weeks before he died. ""We made out wills, durable powers of attorney and a trust"" for Mr. Lupo's daughter, Mr. Germain said. ""We also made some arrangements for the son in the will. We had to do some sophisticated planning."" For Mr. Lupo's widow, the advance planning came as a great relief even as she mourned her husband. ""We had everything in place,"" she said. ""I had no idea how to do any of this. They guided me seamlessly."" Organization of one's estate will certainly not lessen the emotional turmoil, but it will smooth the way to financial security in the fog of grief. More than 800,000 Americans lose their spouses each year, and 700,000 of them are women, according to the Census Bureau. Because women generally outlive men, they spend an average of 14 years without a spouse. There are now more than 14 million widows and widowers, accounting for about one-quarter of the over-65 population. Although in the past, one spouse -- usually the husband -- ""took care"" of all of the financial planning, Mr. Germain said, most people don't do a very good job of it. That traditional role is often a smoke screen for partial preparation and keeping one's spouse largely in the dark, he said.

""Don't think of an estate plan as a 'death' plan,"" Mr. Germain advised. ""I try to get that out of my clients' minds. Many people don't have a clue as to what will happen with an estate after death."" One client, he said, a 72-year-old man, changed ownership of his assets while his wife was dying, creating financial chaos. But times are clearly changing when it comes to traditional gender roles. ""Twenty years ago, the average husband did all of the finances,"" said Catherine Anne Seal, a Colorado Springs-based estate planning lawyer and the president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys. ""Now it's not uncommon for the wife to handle finances."" Widows who are inexperienced with money management tend to make a common mistake, Ms. Seal said: They ""make imprudent gifts to adult children"" within a year of their husband's death. Down the road, this may leave the widow short of money, depending on how long she survives her husband. Ms. Seal advises that couples title their assets ""jointly with rights of survivorship,"" particularly if their joint estate is under $4 million. But estate planning becomes more complex if there are multiple marriages and stepchildren involved. ""Couples in second marriages need good estate planning with attorneys who understand these issues,"" Ms. Seal said. Such professionals can provide a checklist of what both spouses should know: Where are the documents relating to Social Security? Insurance policies? Marriage and birth certificates? Wills? Powers of attorney? Living trusts? It is also important to have a list of all assets, such as real estate, stocks, bonds, savings accounts, safe deposit boxes and trusts. Also on the to-do list: locating the titles to all properties, ranging from autos to vacation homes. Veterans should have copies of all military discharge papers.

Another vital step is to appoint capable, financially skilled trustees in your powers of attorney, Mr. Germain said. They could be family members, but they should have some working knowledge of how to handle money. The National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys has a searchable online directory for people who want to find a lawyer who can help handle these complexities. When interviewing prospective lawyers, ask them if they specialize in the particulars of your situation: Are you divorced? Do you have a special-needs child? Do you have properties in several states? You should also involve your tax planner and financial planner -- if you have them. A certified financial planner who acts as fiduciary can work directly with your accountant and family lawyer. At the root of a transparent estate plan, most lawyers say, is openness and communication. Both spouses should attend the meetings with lawyers and financial professionals. And each spouse should know the location of all important documents and understand what will happen upon death. Contingency plans should be made in the event one spouse becomes disabled or incapacitated. Prepare a workable estate plan while you are healthy. Cognitive decline can take its toll on couples' abilities to manage and execute an estate plan. ""Most people are in denial about what the aging process looks like,"" Ms. Seal said. ""That's why you need trustworthy agents in your powers-of-attorney documents. You need to create a plan for incapacity."" Ms. Lupo of New Jersey emphatically agrees. ""Realize that you need to take the time to understand your finances,"" she said. ""When you're well -- that's when you need to plan."""
11053,Is New York's Arts Diversity Plan Working? It's Hard to Tell,"While the CreateNYC program increased funding for smaller neighborhood arts organizations, it never required institutions to disclose the demographic data that would help measure progress.","Critics say progress on a plan to improve diversity at major cultural institutions in New York City, like Carnegie Hall and New York City Ballet, is difficult to pin down.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/27/arts/26DIVERSITY-COMBO/26DIVERSITY-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=762d4e39747a0e1721952e631f89633a819843a41c51b20f729f4828e63a3f32&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/arts/design/diversity-new-york-culture-plans.html,86e90ce4-043a-53c2-8cdd-5fe3f518c821.jpg,"It was born of high hopes: a program for cultural institutions that receive New York City funding and operate on New York City land. Under the plan, Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to hold august institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Carnegie Hall accountable for hiring more members of historically marginalized and underrepresented groups and for making their boards of directors and other leadership ranks more inclusive. ""This will be a factor in funding decisions by the city going forward,"" Mr. de Blasio said. ""We do this because we believe in fairness."" But the Department of Cultural Affairs did not set numerical goals for what constituted progress, nor did it require that institutions provide baseline demographic statistics about their staffs. So while the program is heralded as one of the first municipally driven efforts to create diversity in cultural organizations, and it did increase funding for smaller, neighborhood arts groups, its ability to accomplish real change, and measure it, is being questioned.

Is this museum or that dance company actually doing better at hiring Black and Latino staff members? Without the numbers, for the city, it's still more of a question than an answer and it's a question that lingers even as some museum staffs, fueled by anger over the killings of Black people like George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery, have pushed past the city's efforts and are demanding an accelerated pace of change and accountability from institutions. ""We have to move from tokenism to transformation,"" Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, which funded the research for the cultural plan, said. ""The token one or two Black or Latinx people on a board is no longer acceptable or acknowledged as progress."" The cultural plan, known as CreateNYC, was announced at a July 2017 news conference with a large dais at which the city distributed a 180-page report on the issue. ""The completion of the first cultural plan for New York City is a profound and historic achievement,"" Jimmy Van Bramer, the chairman of the City Council's cultural affairs committee who helped spearhead legislation to create the plan, said. Mayor de Blasio indicated at the news conference that he intended to tie funding to the diversity improvements made by the 33 organizations, though he did not specify how the city would penalize those that failed to show progress. ""We're saying this matters,"" he said. ""It is one of the things that needs to be considered.""

""We wanted organizations to do what made the most sense for them and to do it in the way they thought they were most likely to make progress,"" Mr. Finkelpearl said. For one thing, he said, as a matter of law, the city could not legally set quotas. ""You can't say to an institution, 'The next 10 people you hire must be people of color,'"" he said. ""But what you can say -- and what's in these plans -- is, 'Here are the steps we're going to take to have a diverse applicant pool.'"" Mr. Van Bramer said that, the mayor's comments notwithstanding, the plan's architects never decided whether funding would be tied to organizations' progress. ""That's always been fairly nebulous,"" he said. ""There's really no way to enforce it."" All of which worries the people who had hoped the plan would do more than just point the way to a more virtuous future. Elena Ketelsen Gonzalez, a senior fellow of public programs and community engagement at MoMA PS1 who has been a consultant on issues of equity and language access, said it was difficult to see how the plan would work without a firm enforcement mechanism. ""I worry that institutions need a monetary impetus to follow through,"" she said. For now, the metric used to review the institutions' progress is simply to evaluate the plans they have set forth for meeting their diversity goals. The program asked them to set measurable -- though not specifically numerical -- one-, three- and six-year goals in the plans submitted last year.

Many contain broad commitments. The Met museum pledged to increase the ""overall diversity"" of its board. One of Lincoln Center's goals is to ""expand the scope"" of its intern applicant pool. ""I call those wishes, not plans,"" Michael M. Kaiser, the chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the University of Maryland, said. ""I think that unfortunately characterizes most planning at cultural institutions. It's just not detailed enough and specific enough,"" he said, looking back on the New York City program. ""Those kinds of goals are so general that they don't lead to too much change."" Only 13 of the 33 plans disclose any details of the makeup of their staff or boards. Diversity is also often employed as an umbrella term, without institutions' specifying whether their goals relate to race, ethnicity, gender identity or inequalities in other areas. Gonzalo Casals, the city's cultural affairs commissioner since March, said the plans were never intended to check boxes. ""It's not about saying '60 percent of my staff are people of color or come from a marginalized group,'"" he said. ""These are very long-term plans that will form the decisions organizations make through the years."" A few institutions did articulate specific targets: The American Museum of Natural History, for example, met its first-year goal of increasing the number of people of color on its board to at least 20 percent. It reached 21 percent last year, compared with 12 percent in 2014. The Public Theater pledged that its full-time staff would be no more than 50 percent white by 2023 -- a goal it is close to achieving. Other commitments are more couched. The Bronx Museum of the Arts said it was committed to short- and long-term ""gradual salary changes that are feasible and doable.""

At Lincoln Center, which has now implemented a set plan to expand the intern applicant pool, K'idar Miller, the associate director of equity and impact, said it was not necessary to set specific numerical targets to demonstrate a commitment to progress. His current position, for instance, was not specified in the initial plan but was created last year. ""Our plan was very much aspirational in a way that became tangible very quickly,"" he said. Dr. Moreno Vega said the time is past for platitudes. ""Every 10 years there's this effort to diversify these institutions that historically have focused on a Eurocentric community,"" she said. ""But they don't change."" The first progress reports from the institutions should be submitted to the department this fall. But for some critics, the yearslong time frame for change is much too slow. In June, anonymous employees wrote an open letter to the Met's leaders, criticizing them for the ""dismissal, silencing or erasure"" of those who have spoken up about racial, gender and sexual bias. In response the Met pledged to hire a diversity officer within four months, employ only paid interns by 2022 and earmark more than $10 million to diversify its collection and exhibitions. These detailed commitments were not in the plan filed with the city. ""For a museum to put out that kind of manifesto is encouraging,"" Mr. Walker said. ""It's way beyond what the city would require.""

Pushing the larger institutions to greater inclusivity is a tougher task, but one aided by the internal pressures unleashed in recent months. Ms. Gonzalez said it is no longer enough to hire people of color. ""It's one thing to bring in diverse interns, fellows and junior staff to run your social media campaign or infomercials,"" she said. ""It's another to actually listen to and value those voices."" But for many organizations, the most pressing challenge now is the most basic of all: survival. From March through early May, more than 15,000 employees were laid off or furloughed from the city's cultural institutions because of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report the department commissioned. Mr. Van Bramer said, ""Frankly, how places can keep their doors open is dominating just about every call."" Staff reductions can have a significant impact on diversity numbers, in part because many layoffs strike the lower ranks of employees, which typically include higher concentrations of people of color. Mr. Walker said if the city wants the institutions to make good on their diversity plans, it must follow through by watching how these departures affect the organizations' demographics."

The aesthetic direction of ""Claws,"" a show starring Niecy Nash and Karrueche Tran, is a lesson in maximalism. An example in just one outfit: In episode two, Desna Simms, played by Ms. Nash, wears a yellow-and-black cheetah print dress, thigh-high boots covered in black tassels and a cheetah print purse (which does not technically match the other cheetah print) -- all paired with electric blue French tip nails. The show, which returned to TNT on June 9, is about five South Florida manicurists who are introduced to the drug trade when Ms. Simms, the owner of the nail salon, decides to launder money for a nearby ""pill mill,"" a pharmacy that sells too much painkiller and is located in the same strip mall. The manicurists in her salon follow suit. Behind all the acrylics and gel and press-on and polish is Morgan Dixon, 28, who started as a nail technician on the first season and now runs the show's nail department. She and three other artists make all costume decisions relating to fingers and toes -- ostensibly the main characters' stock-in-trade.

She works with Dolores Ybarra, the show's costume designer, to create each look and they only abide by one rule: nails should rarely, if ever, match the outfits. Why? Ms. Dixon want to make sure their hands stand out. She has multiple Pinterest folders stuffed with digital inspirations for the nail art for each of the different characters. Ms. Dixon spent part of her adolescence growing up in Jacksonville, Fla ., studying art history and international relations at the local University of North Florida. But she said she gets much of her inspiration for the ""Claws"" looks outside the classroom and through observing everyday life in Jacksonville: ""The retirement community, the palm trees, the hood, crab trays, the beach, airbrush tees,"" she said. That said, she still sees the manicure as a distinct form of artistry, one that is not so different from what she studied in school.

The look: A twist on the French manicure ""O.G. nail appreciators know the French mani was a real bossy look,"" said Ms. Dixon about the main character's manicure. Her nails, electric blue tips and gold accents, like Desna Simms herself, are extreme, bold and authoritative -- to be respected. At the beginning of season one, Desna desperately works to get her girls and herself out of ""the game."" In season two, she reverses and goes all in on the drug trade: ""I made a choice, we all did,"" she says. And because the character has embraced her boss status in crime (and at a casino), her hands must reflect that. ""She wants people to recognize her nails,"" Ms. Dixon said.

The look: Crystals and jewel-tone stones that pop behind a hot magenta set ""Virginia is all about being boughetto,"" said Ms. Dixon, mixing the words ""bourgeoisie"" and ""ghetto."" Whether the character is working as an exotic dancer at She She's or riding in the passenger seat of Densa's Maserati, she is never without hair knockers, bamboo earrings and sky-high heels. And her nails are always done. After Virginia was shot in the last scene of the season two finale, viewers were left wondering if she'd survive. And several months before season three, a clue was revealed on her character's Instagram account. A photo was posted of Ms. Tran, dressed as Virginia, in a frosty, baby blue faux fur coat with a Ring Pop on her finger, her nails a transparent yellow with ""coffin-shaped"" tips outlined in rhinestones.

The look: Old town Tampa, Fla. ""No matter how crazy her pattern combinations from head to toe, they always go together perfectly,"" Ms. Dixon said of the character Polly Marks, another manicurist on the show. But that doesn't mean those patterns match. Polly wears prints on print on prints: striped multicolored tops, a poodle skirt with cartoonish Dalmation dogs all over, a patterned scarf around her neck. Her nails are always complementary to the look, but completely distinct. (One particular inspiration for Polly's nails were the Spanish tiles in Tampa's old town district.) ""I make sure that whatever they're wearing on their bodies, their nails are going to be an opposite color of the pattern or color scheme,"" Ms. Dixon said of the ""Claws"" characters. ""In my mind, I'm trying to make these nails stand out as much as possible.""

The look: Lots of animal prints, flowers and butterflies ""Jenn will throw anything on her nails and wants to grab your attention,"" said Ms. Dixon. Her character, Jennifer Husser, is a southern belle raising two young girls who is currently trying to keep her marriage from ending after her husband found out she cheated . In one scene in season two, the viewer sees a rare moment of Jennifer without her nails done, showing just how bad things had gotten. Ms. Dixon pulls inspiration for Jenn's nails from nature; elaborate butterfly extensions are pasted on the tips. Her nails must ""grab the viewers eyes from afar,"" Ms. Dixon said.

The look: Just one long pinkie nail Uncle Daddy , a local crime lord and sometime nemesis to Ms. Nash's character on the show, rocks a single, manicured pinkie nail. One of the most memorable was a wooden nail, complete with a gold framed photo of his wife (who was shot): the ultimate tribute. Offscreen and backstage, his look seems to have sparked a trend. ""I had more men asking me if we could make them a pinkie nail than I had a lady crew asking for a full set,' Ms. Dixon said."

Cathy Marston, known for ambitious narrative works, brings her adaptation of Bronte's novel to American Ballet Theater.

""You feel trapped, like the walls are closing in,"" said the ballet mistress, demonstrating a sequence of frantic, elbow-jutting arms. ""Keep the legs low, it's not about the height, it's about wanting to get out of here."" Devon Teuscher, Misty Copeland and Isabella Boylston, the American Ballet Theater principals who are all cast in the title role in Cathy Marston's ""Jane Eyre,"" opening at the Metropolitan Opera House on Tuesday , listened intently as they copied the movements and tried to absorb the intentions behind them. It was February, and an early rehearsal for the full-length ballet, based on Charlotte Bronte's 1847 novel. With its first-person narrative and intense focus on an interior consciousness, Bronte's novel isn't an obvious candidate for a ballet. But Ms. Marston, 43, a British choreographer who has slowly forged a reputation for her ability to create narrative works, seems undaunted by the challenges of transmuting literary complexity into dance. It was the strength and unpredictability of Jane's character that attracted her, she said, adding that she was often drawn to strong women as protagonists, including Mrs. Alving in Ibsen's ""Ghosts,"" Cathy in ""Wuthering Heights"" and Queen Victoria -- all characters around whom she has created ballets.

Jane, she added, ""is a kind of early feminist, fighting both the world and questioning her own emotions and reactions."" ""Jane Eyre,"" to a score by Philip Feeney that incorporates music by Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn and Fanny Mendelssohn, was first created for Northern Ballet in England in 2016. It has proved a game changer for Ms. Martson. British critics praised the clear storytelling in ""Jane Eyre,"" Ms. Marston's craft and her innovative physicality. This Jane is ""emancipated from the conventional tropes of the ballet heroine,"" Judith Mackrell wrote in The Guardian. After years of relative obscurity, Ms. Marston was suddenly on the radar. Helgi Tomasson, the director of the San Francisco Ballet, invited her to create a work (""Snowblind"") for the company's ""Unbound"" festival last year; she also made a full-length ballet, ""Victoria,"" about the queen, for Northern Ballet. A new piece for the Royal Ballet is scheduled for February 2020.

She acknowledged that the pressure on ballet directors to find and feature female choreographers, hasn't hurt. ""The woman thing is certainly part of it,"" she said. ""And I think that companies know that narrative ballets often end up being productive for all in the end, and I have a lot of experience with narrative ballets by now."" Kevin McKenzie, the director of American Ballet Theater, said he first heard about Ms. Marston after ""Snowblind"" was commissioned. ""Then her name kept coming up,"" he said. ""I liked that she was a storyteller at heart and the sound of her process."" Still, when he met her after her stint in San Francisco, ""I had to be blatantly honest and say I had never seen anything she had done."" After that meeting, Ms. Marston sent Mr. McKenzie videos of her work, including one of ""Jane Eyre,"" which he found ""unusual and fascinating."" He asked her to create a new one-act ballet for Ballet Theater's fall 2020 season. Then a crisis loomed. A full-evening program planned for this year's Met season fell through. Mr. McKenzie thought of ""Jane Eyre."" ""I told Cathy that if she could figure out how to stage the ballet in a short time, let's do it."" Ms. Marston didn't hesitate. ""You have to grab the moment,"" she said firmly. Her interest in choreography began early. She took part in workshops and looked up to older students like Christopher Wheeldon and David Dawson, who were making choreographic inroads. There was certainly a glass ceiling, she said. ""I wasn't the ballerina type, and I didn't get offered a place in the company,"" she said. ""The fact that I was a choreographer, and had won the school's choreographic prize, didn't make a difference, whereas I think for a man it probably would have.""

Instead, she joined the Zurich Ballet in Switzerland, later moving to companies in Lucerne and Bern. She continued to make dances and in 2001 returned to Britain, determined to focus on choreography. There she created ""Ghosts,"" her first full-length work, in 2005. ""Ghosts"" led to an offer to direct the Bern Ballet, where she worked from 2007 to 2013, choreographing more than a dozen works, but also commissioning pieces. It was, she said, ""a huge wake-up call about what it means to be a director."" (And for the moment that's off the table: ""I have two children, and I want to be a mother and a choreographer and a cultural leader,"" she said. ""But I've realized I don't have to do all of that fully at the same time."") Her exposure in Bern to German regietheater (or, director's theater), in which the director plays freely with the playwright's original directions or intentions, was important in helping her develop a method of storytelling, she said. ""I began to question whether I really had to use period costume if I was telling a period tale, whether I needed props, how much could be symbolic,"" she said. ""Without a point of view, I realized all the work just looks the same.""

But as Jenny Tattersall, the ballet mistress teaching the Ballet Theater dancers, indicated as she demonstrated the steps, Ms. Marston, unusually, gives every step a specific meaning or intention. ""It's very different from what we are used to, which is learning the steps and then figuring out how you want to interpret it,"" said Ms. Teuscher, who is performing the role of Jane on the first night . ""Here, it happens all together, and at first I found it difficult to process. But then once you have it, everything is very clear: This is the story, and this is how it's told."" Although Ms. Marston's sources tend to be set in the past, her physical vocabulary can be contemporary and unconventional, with a considerable amount of floor work and off-balance partnering in which the women often bear their partners's weight. ""There is a lot of counterbalancing in the partnering,"" said James Whiteside, who performs the central male role of Rochester in ""Jane Eyre."" ""In conventional ballet, the man is often just holding the woman upright. Here we do a lot of dropping to the ground, and I make a lot of noise. I'm working on finessing that."" Ms. Marston said she was very conscious of the way that classical ballet suggests gender roles. ""A contemporary vocabulary allows us to show women differently,"" she said. ""You need the full range, so that women can partner and support men, in order to express what women actually feel and do. There is a long way to go there. It should give me a job for the next 20 years."" Tuesday through Monday at the Metropolitan Opera House, Manhattan; abt.org."

But a trip is bound to come with challenges.","Mary and Michael Behnke with one of their grandsons, Owen Dietrich, on a trip to New York City.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/travel/11skipgen-trips5-02/11skipgen-trips5-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=299bcda768f8e4d06ad9c0d77bdaeb20ca4805a71bde7e425ee12f69ab7607e6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/travel/grandparent-grandchild-trips.html,817824d1-a0d1-5e6b-b919-498980c3d418.jpg,"By all accounts, Marco Abbey is the sort of guy you'd welcome on any trip. He holds doors and hauls suitcases. He has a great sense of direction. He's game to try different cultural activities. It's no wonder Marilyn Abbey, his grandmother, has crowned him ""the perfect travel companion."" If Grandma knows best, it's because she took Marco on a weeklong trip to New Mexico in July 2018, shortly after his 12th birthday. The duo baked bread and made dream-catchers at the Hyatt Regency Tamaya, visited the Albuquerque zoo (the snakes were a hit) and explored the area on guided nature walks. ""I was never the grandmother who wanted to be babysitting every Monday,"" said Ms. Abbey, 85, a retired writer and editor in Northfield, Ill. ""I've always liked taking them to different places and I've always felt happy exposing them to a variety of new things."" Ms. Abbey, who has now taken all of her grandchildren -- four girls and two boys -- on special train trips around their 12th birthday, isn't alone. About a third of the more than 2,600 grandparents recently surveyed online by AARP Research have traveled alone with their grandchildren. The Family Travel Association noted a similar trend last year, surveying 1,168 grandparents and finding that 37 percent were likely to take their grandchildren on a skip-generational trip -- as in, without their own children -- in the coming three years.

""We've found that grandparents are looking for the conveniences of home in a safe environment with lots of activities both generations can enjoy,"" said Jesse Kearns, the Timber Ridge resort manager. ""Safety is a big concern, and being in an environment where everyone can enjoy the day at their own pace is key. A water park with lifeguards is a perfect fit: Grandparents appreciate the lazy river and family slides; grandkids love splashing the day away."" The glories of the U.S. national park system draw hundreds of millions of visitors each year.

* None National Park Booking App: Traveler and travel industry Traveler and travel industry frustration is growing with Recreation.gov, the online portal to book federal land accommodations and access. Beach and theme-park vacations are the most popular gramping trips, according to the Family Travel Association survey. Although none of Disney's family-friendly features (child care, multi-bedroom suites) are designed specifically for grandparents, the survey also found that Walt Disney World parks rank high among skip-gen vacationers. Guided tours, which handle accommodations, meals and activities, are another option.

That was Ginger Bradbury's move last June, when she and the sexagenarians she described as ""the best people on the planet"" explored Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard with VBT Bicycling Vacations. Along with Ms. Bradbury's cousin, they biked more than 100 miles over the course of a week; electric E-bikes made it possible to cruise together, despite her ""Pop-Pop's"" knee replacement. ""There were a lot of people in our group who were surprised they were my grandparents,"" said Ms. Bradbury, a 21-year-old college student in Pennsylvania. ""It's pretty unique to be able to have that age difference and still be able to go on bike trip together."" Tauck Bridges, the family-focused trips from Tauck, are about one-third skip-gen, according to the company. Especially popular among grandparents are itineraries with broad appeal, such as National Parks (which might include a pontoon float down the Colorado River) and European river cruises (which might include organized games onboard and scavenger hunts on land).

Michael and Mary Behnke, of York, Me., selected two of such trips when their two eldest (of four) grandsons each turned 11. In 2016, they took grandson Owen Dietrich on a Broadway theater immersion in New York City; two years later, they took grandson James Behnke on an adventurous romp through Colorado, complete with white water rafting and a hot-air balloon ride. The Behnkes, both in their mid 70s, came to appreciate the preplanned nature of Road Scholar's approach,. ""Having activities set up allows you to enjoy watching your grandkids experiencing a new place and new people: interacting with a group, following directions and expressing ideas,"" said Ms. Behnke, a Classics teacher. ""If we were schlepping around trying to organize the subway in New York and get from one place to another with him, I'm not sure we'd have been at our best."" Road Scholar also segments its skip-gen trips by children's age ranges. Active grandparents might take their preteen or teenage grandchildren kayaking and surfing in San Diego; a Poconos getaway, meanwhile, is designed for 5-year-olds and 11-year-olds alike (two words: wolf preserve). Indeed, trips with an animal or wildlife component are usually a hit with skip-gen families, according to the company, as are the National Parks and Paris. Hands-on activities (say, an escape room in a French chateau) help children stay off their phones, and a photo-sharing app allows parents to peep the action from afar.

""We saw a totally new place and we did totally new things, but we know them and they know us, so it was a very comfortable situation,"" said Ms. Miller, 70, who will take the boys on another National Geographic-Lindblad cruise -- this time to Iceland -- this summer. At home in Bethesda, Md., Margery Miller Shanoff, Ms. Miller's daughter, didn't worry one bit. ""I lost all of my grandparents pretty early, and I want my kids to have as much time with theirs as they possibly can,"" said Ms. Miller Shanoff, 45. ""Kids are different -- and usually better -- when parents aren't around. It's fine if the grandparents don't do everything the same as you or if they mess up the schedule or feed the kids nothing but junk. None of that matters in the longer term,"" she said. Of course, grampers are bound to face generational differences. For the Millers, that meant wrangling two school-age boys who wanted to wear shorts and T-shirts -- in 30 degrees. ""They're always poking fun of me for whatever I'm doing -- being cold, walking slow, walking fast -- but I can goad them on just like they can goad me on. I was a teacher for a lot of years,"" said Ms. Miller.

None of the grampers interviewed for this article had to contend with much homesickness, possibly because their grandchildren were all in the double digits. That tracks with the Family Travel Association survey, where most grandparents cited 8 to 12 years as an ideal age range. (Unsurprisingly, none expressed interest in traveling with a newborn or 1-year-old.) ""It's the perfect moment between childhood and adolescence, and it's an age where they're able to stay up later, be a little more flexible with food and get to know other kids even if they're a little shy,"" said Ms. Behnke. The Behnkes will fete their third-oldest grandson's 11th birthday on a Road Scholar Grand Canyon tour in June; their youngest grandson, bringing up the rear, has already expressed his wishes: Greece. (He has been vetoed.) The Millers are toying with where to eventually take their four granddaughters, 3 to almost 10. And as grampers on both ends of the generational spectrum know: Like fine wine, relationships get better with age. ""When I could go over to my grandparents' house when I was little, they would be in their grandparent role: making sure you grow up healthy and strong,"" said Ms. Bradbury, already a young adult on her VBT bike tour. ""Now we have a real friendship -- our relationship has shifted from a teaching role to a companion role."" Sarah Firshein is the Tripped Up columnist for The Times.

Born to two South African jazz greats, she grew up in the Chelsea Hotel and came of age in the 1990s on Brooklyn's left-field hip-hop scene. Today she keeps its spirit alive on records like the boom-bappy ""Everything's Fine"" (2018), made in collaboration with Quelle Chris, and ventures further afield: Many of her more recent releases -- like the irreverent ""That's Not How You Do That Either"" (2015) and the woozy, atmospheric ""Sevvin"" (2016) -- are far from rap music, per se.

BETTYE LAVETTE at City Winery (July 15, 8 p.m.). LaVette can straight-talk her way through a crooked tale: With a common-sense delivery and a crinkly-voiced Midwestern air, she injects a sense of tensile restraint into almost every song. You get the sense that she ought to be reading you the riot act but just can't be bothered to make time. LaVette scored a few hits on the R&B charts in the 1960s and early '70s, but her career went into a lull until the mid-2000s, when a run of strong records on the Anti- label put her back in the spotlight. And her success continues today: LaVette's most recent record, ""Things Have Changed,"" is a collection of stone-cold Dylan covers, and it's a winner.

Skynyrd has gone from concerts in the early 1970s speckled with Confederate flags to, well, strikingly similar-feeling concerts speckled with the Stars and Stripes today. In addition to the songs you know, like ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and ""Simple Man,"" the band's repertoire now includes tunes like ""Red, White and Blue (Love It or Leave It)"" and ""Gimme Back My Bullets"" -- both of which were featured on their 2018 album, ""Live in Atlantic City.""

But his buoyant, aerated swing feel has also graced albums by numerous other jazz luminaries, including John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock and Dexter Gordon. When he leads his own ensembles in concert, Heath takes his time between songs, teasing the audience with playful banter. This concert -- featuring the pianist Emmet Cohen and the bassist Russell Hall, both of whom are about a third Heath's age -- is aptly billed as a night of ""jazz and comedy.""

The group's diversity makes sense for a trumpeter like Henderson, whose idea of jazz encompasses subtle backbeats, swarming atmospherics and virtuoso hard-bop playing.

RYAN KEBERLE AND CATHARSIS at Jazz Standard (July 17, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). This trombonist and composer is celebrating the release of a fine new album, ""The Hope I Hold,"" featuring his long-running combo, Catharsis. Over the past five-plus years he has steadily expanded this group's instrumentation and palette: It now includes Scott Robinson on saxophone and various other horns; Camila Meza on guitar and vocals; Jorge Roeder on bass; Eric Doob on drums; and Keberle on trombone, vocals, keyboards and synthesizers. On ""Hope,"" all those tones give the music a lovely, splayed-out energy, turning his sighing compositions into big, open canvases. At this concert, Matt Clohesy will fill in for Roeder. 

212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com CECILE MCLORIN SALVANT WITH THE BILL CHARLAP TRIO at the 92nd Street Y (July 18, 7:30 p.m.). At just 29, Salvant has already cemented her reputation as today's leading interpreter of the vocal tradition in jazz. She puts her prodigious talent to work on a vast range of material, often reaching into some of the music's dustiest annals. Her greatest affection is for oddball material from another era -- tunes that might have made it into the jazz canon but didn't quite. She has become a regular headliner at the 92Y's annual Jazz in July series, and here she appears with the erudite pianist Bill Charlap (who programs the festival), the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Kenny Washington. Jazz in July begins on Tuesday, with a concert featuring the guitarist and vocalist John Pizzarelli, and runs through July 25. 

212-415-5500, 92y.org/jazzinjuly CHERUBS at Saint Vitus Bar (July 13, 7 p.m.). What is good may never die but rises again harder and stronger. In the early 1990s, this Texas-based three piece was good -- an eight ball of sprawling energy churning out tunes that were as catchy as they were chaotic. Unfortunately that fun house ride came to an end in 1994, lasting just a few years and resulting in two albums. But about five years ago, they plugged back in and resumed cranking out their uniquely layered melange of stoner's delight, dirtbag blues and stygian grooves as if not a day had passed. And if their November 2017 gig at Saint Vitus warming up the crowd for Unsane was any indication, their live performance chops are perhaps even tighter. Cherubs make their way back to Brooklyn on Saturday night two weeks in advance of the release of their latest album, ""Immaculada High.""

Perhaps the most concrete news: The company, from here on, will perform (sometimes) with live music.

At the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University, the troupe's junior ensemble, Taylor 2, is giving us a glimpse of that future. On Thursday, from a section of seats in the audience, the 13 members of the chamber orchestra American Virtuosi, led by Kenneth Hamrick, provided bracing, nuanced accompaniment for Mr. Taylor's ""Airs,"" ""The Uncommitted"" and, finally, the celebrated and celebratory ""Esplanade.""

The only drawback to this arrangement was the music's tendency to upstage the dancing, though increasingly less so throughout the evening, as the six dancers sank more deeply into their roles. (You can't not throw yourself into ""Esplanade."") The disparity was most pointed during the joyous, wistful ""Airs"" (1978), in which Taylor hallmarks -- proud, scurrying runs or low, darting leaps -- felt tepid compared with the lilting Handel overture.

The dancers, who vary in skill level, abandoned some of that decorum for ""The Uncommitted."" This more visceral piece from 2011, to plangent Arvo Part, deploys one anguished soloist after the next in the center of the stage. Each is swept up by a tempestuous ensemble and swiftly replaced by another; everyone here is equally alone. Later, they direct that tormented energy toward one another: Hank Bamberger and Gabriel Speiller hurl themselves through a convincing dance fight, as others enact slow-motion brawls in the background."

But tap the walls or peer into the back of a closet, and who knows what you might find? A hidden staircase, a secret passageway, or walls that pivot could lead to unknown territory.

Some of these oddities are legacies of singular historic moments, like Prohibition. At a town house for sale in Greenwich Village, which operated as a speakeasy in the 1930s, a second-floor window was a false door that led to the fire escape and from there to the adjoining yard -- very handy when enforcement agents raided the place. Other secrets were the work of architects with a flair for tricky detail, or reminders of an era in which building codes were less rigorous and apartments were reconfigured with impunity. Still others had specific purposes, like hiding the family silver or keeping servants out of sight, that are less relevant today."
54401,Quarterly Earnings Reports Can Still Move Markets,"Even in an age of instantaneous access to information, time-honored earnings metrics retain a heavy-hitting power to swing share prices.","Walmart was among the companies that recently issued a pessimistic earnings outlook. Even in an era of continuous online data, earnings reports still have the ability to move markets, a new study shows.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/25/business/25-STRA/25-STRA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=42dd995016b97b3a050b379d229db65570b05e0902a3fdf535e8f4b52b2f613f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/your-money/quarterly-earnings-reports-can-still-move-markets.html,2885a276-693d-5eac-b40a-0d1deca43d08.jpg,"It is earnings season, and for much of corporate America it is a time of trouble. Publicly traded companies have been revealing their profits and losses for the third quarter of the year and signaling some of their expectations for the future. While a few big companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft posted strong earnings last week, many of the report cards have been dreary. Factors like global interest rates, politics and the national mood affect the stock market, but earnings are crucial, and how investors interpret this deluge of information may well determine whether share prices keep rising in the months ahead. Some of the mediocre earnings data has already been baked into share prices, which rose sharply last week and have just about recovered from the summer's sharp decline. But even in an era of seemingly limitless online information and nanosecond trading, quarterly earnings reports and conference calls retain their ability to move markets, a new study has found. ""Earnings reports are still affecting the markets in a big way -- even more than they did five or 10 or 20 years ago,"" said Maureen McNichols, an accounting professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. During the three days surrounding quarterly reports, share prices are four times as likely to have big moves as they typically do, said Ms. McNichols, a co-author of the study, which examined data from 1971 to 2011.

It found that the impact of earnings reports on stock prices has increased since a series of Wall Street scandals led to regulatory reforms that appear to have improved the reliability of the reports, Ms. McNichols said. ""We've confirmed that the markets are deriving a great deal of information from these reports."" This season, much of the information has been gloomy, and it may take some mental gymnastics to see a silver lining in it. The global economy has slowed, the energy sector has been battered, and the strength of the dollar has reduced sales and profits overseas. When all of the data is in, Wall Street is expecting that for the third quarter of 2015, overall earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will have declined, perhaps by as much as 3 percent. This follows a weak second quarter -- one that, depending on which numbers you use, was flat or slightly negative. What's more, based on corporate disclosures and Wall Street expectations, the decline in profits is projected to continue for the rest of this year. But bad as this litany may seem, it may not be the end of the downward trajectory in earnings. While the consensus on Wall Street is that 2016 will be better for big corporations, things are not expected to improve significantly until the end of next year -- a distant and relatively opaque period, as far as such analysis goes.

""Wall Street analysts are usually more optimistic in their projections for a year down the road and become more realistic when the time for earnings draws closer,"" said John Butters, a senior research analyst at FactSet. ""That's happening again this year."" That said, it may well be realistic to expect an improvement in an important sector: energy, which accounts for the biggest drag on earnings. While third-quarter earnings for the S.&P. 500 are expected to drop 2.8 percent over all compared with the same period a year earlier, the drop for energy companies is estimated to be 65 percent, according to Wall Street consensus figures compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Companies like Halliburton, which reported a 36 percent drop in revenue and a $54 million loss for the third quarter on Monday, have been hit hard by the decline in oil, coal and natural gas prices of the last year. But by the end of 2016, energy companies will be comparing their earnings with this year's dismal results, a much easier contest. It is also quite possible that energy prices will rise from the doldrums by then, bolstering the sector and statistics for the entire stock market. That's hardly the only earnings problem. Other sectors, like technology, have turned in weak overall performances. IBM said on Monday that, partly because of the effects of the strong dollar overseas, its sales and profits had dropped sharply, even as it worked to shift toward high-growth areas like cloud computing. And some important retail companies are hurting. Walmart said this month that sales would flatten this year and that the outlook for earnings was poor. Its stock price promptly fell 10 percent, the biggest one-day decline in more than a decade. With reports like these, it may seem difficult to derive a positive message from this season's information. Yet many investors habitually discount bad news and highlight the bright side."

Kingsman TGC, the scent's name, refers to both the new movie's subtitle, ""The Golden Circle,"" and the name of its villains organization. ""The product was needed for the story as one of the agents, Harry Hart, uses the high-tech after-shave as a bomb to save his life,"" said Matthew Vaughn, the movie's director and a co-producer and co-writer.

The service, Locast, started last year and is available through a free app that relays broadcast feeds online. It has more than 200,000 users in 13 cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington. The networks, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, say in their complaint that Locast is eating into the licensing fees they get from pay-television companies like the cable operator Comcast and the satellite-TV provider Dish that carry the networks' programs and sports events. The networks are expected to receive more than $10 billion in such fees this year. ""A rogue streaming service skirting the law for the benefit of telecom giants does nothing but threaten the very investments in content that consumers value,"" the networks say in the complaint, which was filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan.

David Goodfriend, a lawyer and professor who worked in the Clinton administration, introduced Locast in New York in January 2018. He said he had started the service specifically to challenge the broadcasters' interpretation of the country's copyright law. ""We really did our homework,"" he said in an interview in January. ""We are operating under parameters that are designed to be compliant within the law."" [Read more about Locast and its founder.] Under federal law, broadcast stations must provide their signals free to the public, making networks like those that sued Locast easily available through the use of an antenna. But broadcasters won a provision in copyright law in the 1990s that required pay-TV providers like Comcast and Dish to negotiate what are known as retransmission-consent fees to carry those signals. Locast argues that its service complies with copyright law because as a nonprofit entity, it is allowed to act as a so-called signal booster for the broadcasters' programming. David Hosp, a lawyer for Locast, said in a statement that it ""provides a public service retransmitting free over-the-air broadcasts,"" which is ""expressly permitted under the Copyright Act.""

Locast is a nonprofit organization, but it has ties to companies that must pay licensing fees to the networks. In addition to his time in government, Mr. Goodfriend is a former executive at Dish, which has long chafed at having to pay the broadcast fees. Although Locast relies on donations from viewers, it also accepts money from corporations and recently received $500,000 from the telecommunications giant AT&T. AT&T is locked in a fee dispute with CBS that has resulted in the network's being blacked out since July 20 for more than 6.5 million of AT&T's television subscribers. AT&T has encouraged its users to try Locast during the blackout. The networks' lawsuit is in some ways similar to an earlier legal battle they waged against Aereo, a start-up backed by the media tycoon Barry Diller. Aereo captured over-the-air TV signals and streamed them to subscribers for a monthly fee but did not pay the networks anything. Mr. Diller lost the legal challenge in 2014 when the Supreme Court ruled that Aereo had violated copyright laws, prompting the service to shut down. Locast's roots are in the Aereo case, which Mr. Goodfriend taught in a law lecture at Georgetown University. He wanted to show how the ruling might affect the public interest. ""I had to teach them that more often than not, it's through huge stakeholders battling it out that change happens,"" Mr. Goodfriend said in January. ""There should be something that challenges the broadcasters."""
13490,"Ballet Finds Itself on Higher Ground, Overlooking Lincoln Center","Six short works, including three premieres, were unveiled on a rooftop to benefit the new organization Dancers of N.Y.C.B.",Jacqueline Bologna and Cainan Weber of New York City Ballet performing on the rooftop of the Empire Hotel near Lincoln Center.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/arts/19roof-nycb-1/19roof-nycb-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=944e64cc4452c583afb5fbbb4194f398eb27181e45e29f48078122a1489830b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/arts/dance/dancers-of-nycb-empire-hotel.html,1a387294-3a7a-50eb-b224-82fa43035499.jpg,"A dance on a rooftop is a mysterious thing. How is it that a roof is more like water than land? The breeze that comes with elevation, the way the air dances around you as you watch bodies in motion, unlocks something that can't be replicated on a stage or even, for some strange reason, on grass. On Sunday, the rooftop in question -- at the Empire Hotel -- made up for its small size by location: It was only a half a block away from Lincoln Center, where performances have been on hold since the lockdown began in March. At the Empire, Dancers of N.Y.C.B., a new organization developed to support members of New York City Ballet during the pandemic, presented a benefit performance featuring choreography by former and current company members: Preston Chamblee, Lauren Lovette, Benjamin Millepied, Justin Peck, Janie Taylor and Christopher Wheeldon.

The City Ballet dancers Daniel Applebaum and Lauren King produced the program along with Melissa Gerstein, a former dancer whose daughter attends the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet. It was a group effort, initiated by Ms. Gerstein who, during a welcoming speech, took off her mask for a brief moment to scream, ""Yes!"" (She clearly missed watching live dance as much as the dancers missed dancing.)

The stage was a small patch of Marley flooring, with mirrors hanging on two sides of its perimeter to open up the possibility of seeing dancers from different perspectives. Meaghan Dutton-O'Hara -- brave, determined and standing tall in her point shoes -- led the way with an excerpt from Mr. Wheeldon's enduring ""Polyphonia,"" in which she took care to display every angle with illuminating, fluid sweep. All the dancers wore masks, which made their eyes more pronounced, both to good and distracting effect; Ms. Dutton-O'Hara knows how to make hers enhance the steps. Along with excerpts from works by Mr. Millepied and Mr. Peck -- both serviceable, though neither particularly inspiring -- were new pieces, beginning with Mr. Chamblee's ""An Awaited Breath,"" set to music by Fanny Mendelssohn, for the dancers Jacqueline Bologna and Cainan Weber. It spoke to the turmoil of the moment, with falls to the floor, deep contractions and imploring arms, yet its images of resignation and hope had a tendency to ramble on.

The other two ballets, though just as brief, possessed more point of view. How great is it when the moment a ballet starts, you know exactly who choreographed it? It relates to the choreographers' dancing: From Ms. Taylor, a former City Ballet principal, the quality had to do with a way of melding specificity with wild, carefree abandon; from Ms. Lovette, a current principal, it was the entrancing ability to take positions and loosen them into silken shapes full of power and passion.

Ms. Taylor's ""Schmaltz for Two"" -- a funny title for such a dramatic but unsentimental dance -- woke up the space. Anthony Huxley and Kristen Segin, clad in fire engine red polo tops, faced each another, in sync yet apart, as they circled the tiny stage with flexed wrists; suddenly, their feet burst into a spray of small kicks. In this miniature triptych to music by Joaquin Turina, Aaron Copland, Gyorgy Kurtag and Erik Satie, Ms. Segin, gutsy and electric, next appeared alone, using her elastic torso to dart from here to there trailed by her whipping ponytail. She was followed by Mr. Huxley, whose solo -- full of quick stops and starts -- made much of his impeccable line and ease of musicality until he, just as she had, collapsed to the floor.

The stage become a living canvas as they awoke to Satie: Crawling, sliding and rolling, they eventually made their way upright with a catlike stretch and their arms raised to the sky. Facing each other, they lowered into a first position plie before drooping over -- their bodies limp like thirsty plants -- and stepped sideways reaching their arms toward each other as they backed off the stage as if illustrating a lost embrace. Actually, that last bit was a moment of schmaltz. My heart sank. It was a little anticlimactic and even more cliche. Ms. Lovette's ""Wound Up Wind Down,"" set to ""Thankyoubranch"" by the American-Dutch duo the Books, featured another impressive pairing: Lauren Collett and Emma Von Enck, each in belted knitted dance overalls in pale pink and blue. Positioned back to back, they stretched their arms out, bending forward as their limbs buckled and contorted to create a portrait of mingling sensibilities: eccentric and electric. Shapes came fast, sometimes in a way that made the choreography look under-rehearsed and blurry. But Ms. Lovette's vision, a meld of classical and jazz dance with strains of folk and the occasional backbend, created a particular kind of space for two women to express, in both energetic and despondent ways, something that we've all been dealing with for the past seven months: being trapped in a room.

It couldn't have been a coincidence that each new work had dancers, in some form or another, falling to the floor. Sometimes I feel like doing that, too. But the way these City Ballet dancers banded together -- handling customer service, laying down a Marley floor on the roof of a hotel, curating a program -- was encouraging. They put on a show, and at least for one afternoon, they got to dance again."

McClatchy.

And there was even some extra magic added when the production -- featuring a score trimmed to 85 intermission-free minutes -- returned to the house on Sunday: the brilliant singing of a fine cast of youthful performers. Judging by the enthusiastic ovations that followed every aria, the audience was charmed.

Indeed, when the soprano Kathryn Lewek, as the Queen of the Night, sang her character's dazzling and demonic aria, many people started clapping halfway through, right after she dispatched the famous music's bursts of coloratura passagework with eerie ease and enormous sound. Yes, she was quite a sight in her fantastical costume, a mothlike figure with multiple flapping wings. But it was her singing that had some children near me sitting up in their seats and breaking into applause.

The conductor Lothar Koenigs, working with an abridgment of the score that loses the overture and entire numbers, drew elegance and breadth from the Met orchestra and chorus. You get the feeling this cast would be no less pleasing in a performance of the full, German-language version of the opera."

As KAWS, Brian Donnelly creates cartoon-colored reworkings of well-known pop culture characters rendered slightly askew through recurring motifs -- cauliflower ears and XXs for eyes -- that give the effect of a dream half-remembered. His popularity, based on the raft of toys, fashion collaborations and multimillion dollar auction results, hovers somewhere near the mesosphere. That Mr. Donnelly, who got his start writing graffiti in his native Jersey City, has recently joined the American Museum of Folk Art's board may sound incongruous for someone routinely designated (and euphemistically maligned) as a street artist. But in fact he collects the work of self-taught and outsider American artists. In an upstairs living space in his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, studio, paintings by Joe Coleman and Susan Te Kahurangi King share the wall with large-scale canvases by Peter Saul, while R. Crumb comic panels mix with sketchbooks from graffiti legends like Phase 2 and Dondi White. By joining the folk art trustees, Mr. Donnelly traces a neat concentricity with a board predecessor and shaper of an art movement, Andy Warhol, who could often be found at the Chelsea Flea Market loading his Dodge convertible with Americana and folk pieces. ""When I think of how I collect, it isn't that I'm trying to be a part of some group or collect some type of work,"" he said in his second-floor aerie, as assistants quietly colored paintings downstairs. ""I just like collecting. It's led me to a place where some of the stuff I collect is self-taught. I can't compartmentalize it. For me, I just think of people making stuff. I find a lot of the self-taught stuff is a nice rabbit hole to go down.""

What sort of outsider art do you gravitate toward? A lot of stuff is turning over, new stuff is coming to market. There are great [Martin] Ramirez drawings that have come up. I was collecting Imagists, and drawing connections between, say, Ramirez and Jim Nutt. What really got me into it was Susan King's work, and that was only a few years ago. I was collecting Peter Saul and really like his '60s works on paper, and I saw images of King's work, and what she was doing in the '60s was amazing. It felt like it could have the best conversation with all this Saul stuff. These drawings hold their weight with Peter, with the Chicago Imagists.

Do you feel a kind of stewardship in collecting and preserving work that does not always get institutional representation? I feel that about every work I collect. It's not to be taken lightly, to be the custodian of a work of art, whether it's a piece made just now by some young kid, or something from the '50s. For me, it's not like there's an end goal, but it informs me as an artist. I get really interested in what shows were these works in, and the trajectory of an artist. Also, just having it around and seeing the marks in person. Joe Coleman's Darger portrait you could see in a show, but you're spending, what, two minutes with it, max?

You own a few works by Martin Wong, an artist and inveterate collector in a very specific category. I definitely appreciate what he did as far as taking a body of graf and putting it together in one place for people to view. Lee Quinones was his chef for awhile; to have a place to stay, he cooked for him. There's a lot of overlapping synergies that aren't out front in the textbooks.

Do you consider graffiti an outsider art? I always think: Where does graf fall? You can't look at it the way you do artists coming out of art schools. With graffiti, you're making work to reach people, you have this bravado, you want to dominate spaces, but with self-taught, often people are making work to pass their days; sometimes it's only discovered after they've passed. Say Darger for example: Only after death are you finding all that work. People get out of it what they need. I don't think there's been a lot of great literature about graffiti. You need to have enough distance to look back objectively. I think Henry's [Henry Chalfant] show at the Bronx Museum was a great entry point for people. I mean, I'm far from the person who's going to tell you the definition of outsider art. It's endless. Helen Rae -- did you see her stuff at the Outsider Art Fair? She does these amazing drawings in colored pencil that when you see them they just destroy so much other stuff and you've got to say: when? I'm always thinking about how artists are making different work in other parts of the world, but it seems like they're feeding off each other, like some of the '60s paintings of Tadanori Yokoo, they're very similar to Karl Wirsum in the '60s, and there's no way they're overlapping. There's no internet; it's not like Karl was in the art magazines at the time. You just wonder, what is that? R. Crumb is another who's a complete anomaly. Paul Morris repositioned him, but the work was always there. Sometimes it takes somebody to put it into the system. It's interesting seeing what gets taken into the gallery world."

One popular distraction has been the window into other people's rooms: the glimpses of the domestic habitats of colleagues, celebrities and newscasters that video meetings, Twitter P.S.A.s and home broadcasts are affording us. The blurry visuals and weird angles have been a tonic for the overwrought environments of Instagram (corgis quarantining in Quogue) -- more Loud, as in the seminal 1973 PBS documentary, ""An American Family,"" than Kardashian. The real thrill is the decor peeping. The code switching signaled by the elegant millwork and beautifully bound classics behind the shoulder of your hoodie-wearing boss; the glossy leaves of a philodendron that derailed an entire staff meeting; the animal hide in a new manager's bedroom. A colleague's baby. Anderson Cooper's bookshelves (the gilded bindings, and was that a faux-malachite wall finish?). Every newscaster's bookshelves. Dan Rather's swoopy white laminate kitchen and accordion blinds. The bark wallpaper in Jimmy Fallon's house. Who can concentrate on the endless news?

It was the grommet curtains in William Brangham's living room that set off Elaine Griffin, an interior designer in Brunswick, Ga. It's a beautiful room, and Ms. Griffin was not the first to get bogged down by its details and tune out the reporting delivered by the very sober Mr. Brangham, a correspondent for PBS, who on the night in question was interviewing a hospital C.E.O. on the shortage of medical supplies and the terrible challenges her workers were facing. Ms. Griffin, briefly, allowed herself an escape. She was clocking the white sofa, and was that a John Robshaw pillow? Was the painting above actually fiber art? It seemed to have a texture to it. She noted the fireplace and the bookshelves, more elegant than most. So why, Ms. Griffin wondered, ""does he have the $19.99 panels from Bed Bath & Beyond? Grommet curtains are the drapery equivalent of a No. 1 with fries. He has a fireplace! Why did he cheap out on the curtains?"" With some vehemence, Ms. Griffin then delivered a stern tutorial on how to hang curtains: just below the ceiling and at least four inches on either side of the window trim, a lesson apparently not followed by Mr. Brangham. She then pivoted to the pair of bookshelves flanking the French doors behind Mr. Brangham's head. ""You know his ceilings are higher than eight feet. He's in a million-dollar townhouse in Georgetown. Like, why don't they go floor to ceiling?""

As the playwright Paul Rudnick scans the news, he too has been keeping an eye out for decor tips and ""also hints of newscasters' families, pets and sex dungeons,"" he wrote in an email. Mr. Rudnick added: ""I've appreciated Dr. Max Gomez, a medical expert on CBS News, both for his helpful and sane answers to questions about the virus, and for the fact that he keeps changing locations in what looks like his very nice, immaculate apartment (a clean home gives me confidence in any doctor). Some nights he stands near various impressive pieces of furniture, and on other broadcasts we'll catch a glimpse of tasteful, framed artwork. I'm always hoping that after he answers a question about social distancing he'll say, 'And now let's talk about this lighting fixture', but so far no luck.""

Some reveals are poignant: the decorative flourish as psychological tell. Manuel Sosa is a composer who teaches in the pre-college program at Juilliard; like many professors, he has been holding his classes in Zoom, a truly confounding environment for a musician as instruments cannot be shared there. His students are teenagers, and for the first time he is seeing them in their bedrooms, with all the accouterments of childhood -- stuffed animals, drawings, robot parts and flower stencils on the walls. ""When they pick up an instrument at school,"" Mr. Sosa said, ""they are so powerful, so mature, and yet from the bedroom you see the child is still there. It is where they rest and sleep, and they are more playful. Even their faces look different. It's very tender. It's a reminder to us that they are still kids and we have to safeguard that.""

Among those doing the safeguarding are therapists, of course -- professionals who have been working from home since Freud, never good with boundaries, famously disregarded his own edict that the analyst be a tabula rasa, and exposed his patients to his wife's cooking, his dogs and his collections of African art, among many other stimulating and personal objects. In that space, a sofa was never just a sofa, but an occasion for free association, a cue to unconscious thoughts and deeper feelings. But maybe not this month. Sue Kolod is a psychoanalyst with an office in Manhattan and a second home just north of the city, where she is now conducting sessions remotely for the first time, in a light-filled room with a view of the woods. Dr. Kolod spoke of ""the frame"": a tenet of analysis that dictates that the rules and the setting of the practice be consistent, so the patient can turn his focus within. Now that her frame has changed, her patients are curious.

""They are asking me questions about my room, how I am, where I am. This is a different game,"" she said. ""Before, I might say, 'Now why do you ask that?' I've been talking with some of my colleagues and it just doesn't seem like the right way to handle it. Like everyone, my patients want to know that I am safe. Some are expressing envy, because many of them are stuck in the city, and also relief that I am OK. But like seeing one's boss at home for the first time, it's just going to amplify whatever feelings you had before and I am assuming that patients seeing me in this environment is also going to evoke more of the same. In analysis, it's all grist for the mill."" Even someone not in analysis can grasp that these peeks at other people's private lives, albeit against the backdrop of a pandemic, evoke all sorts of emotions: admiration, sympathy, envy, or perhaps just a mild wistfulness for a more innocent time. For the last two weeks, Emily Listfield, a novelist and branding consultant, has been holed up in her apartment in the Stuyvesant Town complex in Manhattan, working from her dining room table, the only one of her colleagues not settled in a rural or suburban area.

The other day they convened a Zoom piano happy hour. It was a warm afternoon, and everyone but Ms. Listfield was sitting outside and meeting from a yard or porch. Stuyvesant Town's lovely center green is now closed off to the residents, as are its playgrounds, its co-working space and common patio. ""All that fresh air and space,"" Ms. Listfield said of her colleagues' settings. ""It was like looking at a bygone world."" These ""Through the Looking Glass"" moments, the sights of so many heretofore forbidden spaces, can make one feel unexpectedly tender even toward the decor of the rich and famous (David Geffen's much-mocked drone shots of his yacht notwithstanding.) Last week Sherry Turkle, a professor of social science at M.I.T. and the author, most recently, of ""Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age,"" was at home in Boston, pondering the optics of Anderson Cooper's library, Seth Meyers's landing and Andrew Lloyd Webber's vibrant striped curtains, and the photos -- were those his parents? -- on the composer's piano. ""This is a moment for people to be in authentic places, and we need that kind of authenticity,"" Ms. Turkle said. ""People are reaching in. They are not polishing their avatars."" Even Mr. Cooper's plush library, with its ""Venetian tones,"" as she described it, and shelves of rare books, moved her."

Some are visible, in the ""active"" file. Most are buried deep. A few surface only after artists have departed, as is the case with the American photographer Alvin Baltrop, who was unknown to the mainstream art world when he died in 2004 at 55, and who now has a bright, tough monument of a retrospective at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. The show, ""The Life and Times of Alvin Baltrop,"" is also a monument to New York itself during the 1970s and '80s, when Mr. Baltrop did his major work. During those decades, the city was physically falling apart. At the same time, it radiated creative energy. Among other things, in the wake of the 1969 Stonewall uprising, it was home base for a new gay consciousness. Disintegration and rebellion dovetailed in a line of derelict shipping piers that stretched the Hudson River between Chelsea and Greenwich Village. Isolated from the rest of the city after the collapse of the southernmost section of the elevated West Side Highway, the piers became a preserve for gay sex and communion, and the primary subject of Mr. Baltrop's surviving photographs. These include architectural studies of the piers, but also shots of their semi-residential population of homeless people, teenage runaways, sexual adventurers, criminals and artists, a company that Mr. Baltrop, in effect, joined.

Some shots are of the ship itself as a functioning war machine, which, although it never actually went to Southeast Asia during Mr. Baltrop's time, kept its crew busy with on-deck drills. Far more interesting and experimental are images of domestic life at sea: sailors sunbathing; napping on deck, and rubbing shoulders in tight living quarters. And most daring, are dramatically posed and lighted studies of nude male bodies: torsos, buttocks, genitals. In these images, the mood is erotic without being furtive. These are clearly collaborations with willing models.

By this point, just a few years after Stonewall, the piers had become the main stage for an openly expressed gay sexuality, and they drew Mr. Baltrop in. Initially he used his flexible hours as a cabby to visit and photograph them. Then, to gain more time, he quit driving, bought a van and, supporting himself as a freelance mover, camped there for days and nights on end. There's no question that he considered his photographs -- particularly of Pier 52, then located at the end of Gansevoort Street, just beyond where the Whitney Museum of American Art now stands -- a long-term project, a mix of historical documentation, insider anthropology, and autobiography. Life on the piers, with its definable demographic and culture of confinement, was not so different from that on board a ship, and Mr. Baltrop viewed it both from afar and up close. The more than 200 pictures in the Bronx show are very much about pulling back for the broad view, then zeroing in.

He was careful to give the piers a context. He shot the waterfront neighborhood with its bars (The Ramrod, Badlands, the Stud), its transient hotels, and its commercial truck parking lots (which also served as nocturnal trysting places). And he photographed, at varying distances, the abandoned shipping depots and warehouse sheds on the piers themselves. As a group, these images are invaluable contributions to American urban visual history, but also to art history. A lot of new art was happening on the piers. In 1975, the New York artist Gordon Matta-Clark sliced a huge crescent-shaped, light flooded hole in a west-facing wall on Pier 52 and titled it ""Day's End""; a painter named Tava (Gustav von Will) was doing murals, as were younger contemporaries like Mike Bidlo and David Wojnarowicz. Mr. Baltrop recorded some of this work, though it seemed incidental to his true interest. What really gripped him was the grandeur and danger of structural ruin, and the people who occupied it. Look closely at his panoramic views of pier exteriors and you'll see, in many, the presence of tiny figures, clothed or nude, leaning from windows, lounging around, having sex. And the majority of his shots were of populated interiors. In Pier 52, he used a homemade version of a window-cleaner's harness to suspend himself from the ceiling and survey activities below. At the same time, because he became a regular, unthreatening presence, he was able to photograph on-the-ground action, much of it sexual, from an intimate vantage. The piers were not benign places, and Mr. Baltrop knew it. Muggings were common. Murders happened. He took chilling pictures of the police fishing bodies from the Hudson. (One locally famous waterfront habitue, the drag queen and activist Marsha P. Johnson, of whom Mr. Baltrop made a wonderful portrait, was found dead in the river in 1992.) He spoke, later in his life, of ""the frightening, mad, unbelievable, violent, beautiful things that were going on"" at the piers. He was aware that his own attraction to them had a pathological element. ""It became an addiction,"" he said. ""It was like a drug. It was a drug.""

Yet you find little sense of menace in the photographs, most of which are black and white, with a few in color. Raw, cavernous interiors have a church-like luminosity. And, despite repeated images of bare flesh the work can feel erotic but chaste, the way Thomas Eakins's paintings of adolescent boys at a swimming hole do. Much has been made of the ""classical"" poise of explicitly sexual images by Baltrop's celebrated contemporaries Peter Hujar and Robert Mapplethorpe. But Mr. Baltrop's a classicist too, just a less self-conscious one. So why has he been all but ignored until fairly recently? Again, his outsider status as a queer working-class African-American is a big part of the answer. (He had two small shows, one in a bar where he moonlighted as a bouncer, but one gallery owner who saw the pictures referred to him as ""a real sewer rat type""; another accused him of stealing work by a white photographer.) Fortunately, toward the end of his life, he met the painter Randal Wilcox, who immediately saw the value of his photography and, after Mr. Baltrop's death from cancer in 2004, rescued it from what could easily have been obliteration. In addition to a cache of personal items -- identity cards, medical records, cameras -- that are in the Bronx show, Mr. Baltrop left behind a handful of beat-up photographic prints and thousands of rolls of film that he couldn't afford to have processed. In 2008, an Artforum essay by the writer and curator Douglas Crimp (reprinted in the exhibition catalog) put Mr. Baltrop's name into circulation, and his reputation continues to grow. This fall his work will be included in the rehang of the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. He's also in the Whitney's collection. (On the site of Pier 52, which served for more than a decade as his studio and sometime home, a public art project by the artist David Hammons, organized by the Whitney and the Hudson River Park Trust, began construction this week.) Mr. Baltrop himself might well be hard pressed today to recognize the part of the city he once recorded. Among the show's latest images is one of a pier engulfed in flames and smoke. The picture may well date from around 1986, when the ""sex piers"" began to be demolished by the city, to be replaced by the luxury condos, entertainment centers and the transplanted uptown museum there today. It's gratifying to think of Mr. Baltrop, brilliant, persistent, and fully resurrected in the Bronx show, as the true phoenix arising from the ashes.

6540,America's Cities Could House Everyone if They Chose To,Our housing crisis is a symptom of America's wealth — and its indifference.,A homeless man in Times Square in April.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/14/opinion/14bin2/14bin2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b1711dc55998d69b5be213d7b04d4755e207bb112a135831ed456df29343f95c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/opinion/sunday/homeless-crisis-affordable-housing-cities.html,d339e8d2-5715-55e8-b83a-fb9098e8760a.jpg,"Tonight, more than half a million Americans will sleep in public places because they lack private spaces. They will huddle in crowded New York City shelters, or pitch tents under highways in Washington, D.C., or curl up in the doorways of San Francisco office towers, or dig holes in the high desert of northern Los Angeles County. They are homeless, and their lives are falling apart. They struggle to stay healthy, to hold jobs, to preserve personal relationships, to maintain a sense of hope. They are victims of America's wealth -- and its indifference.

The federal government could render homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring. The cure for homelessness is housing, and, as it happens, the money is available: Congress could shift billions in annual federal subsidies from rich homeowners to people who don't have homes. Instead, Americans have taken to treating homelessness as a sad fact of life, as if it were perfectly normal that many thousands of adults and children in the wealthiest nation on earth cannot afford a place to live. Government programs focus on palliative care: Annual spending on shelters has reached $12 billion a year, according to Dennis Culhane, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on homelessness. Rather than provide housing for the homeless, cities offer showers, day care centers and bag checks. Collectively, we are choosing to avert our eyes from the people who sleep where we walk. We have decided to live with the fact that some of our fellow Americans will die on the streets. ""There's a cruelty here that I don't think I've seen,"" Leilani Farha, then the United Nations special rapporteur on adequate housing, said after a 2018 visit to Northern California. She compared conditions there to those in countries that unlike the United States lack the money to care for their citizens.

And homelessness is poised to increase. More than 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past two months; almost 40 percent of workers in households making less than $40,000 a year have lost work. Women in Need NYC, which runs shelters, warned this week that New York faces a ""mass increase"" in homelessness. In the decades after World War II, some experts predicted that prosperity would eliminate homelessness in America. Instead, in recent decades, wealth and homelessness have both increased -- a stark illustration of the inequalities that pervade American life. The rise of homelessness is often portrayed as a collection of personal tragedies, the result of bad choices or bad luck. But the first law of real estate applies to homelessness, too: Location, location, location. The nation's homeless population is concentrated in New York, the cities of coastal California and a few other islands of prosperity. Well-educated, well-paid professionals have flocked to those places, driving up housing prices. And crucially, those cities and their suburbs have made it virtually impossible to build enough affordable housing to keep up. The government calculates that $600 is the most a family living at the poverty line can afford to pay in monthly rent while still having enough money for food, health care and other needs. From 1990 to 2017, the number of housing units available below that price shrank by four million.

Those who do end up homeless are often those with additional burdens. They are disproportionately graduates of foster care or the prison system, victims of domestic abuse or discrimination, veterans, and people with mental and physical disabilities. Some end up on the street because of addictions; some develop addictions because they are on the street. Whatever problems they face, however, they are much more likely to become homeless in places without enough affordable housing. According to one analysis, a $100 increase in the average monthly rent in a large metro area is associated with a 15 percent increase in homelessness. Consider a simple comparison: In 2018, eight out of every 10,000 Michigan residents were homeless. In California, it was 33 per 10,000. In New York, it was 46 per 10,000. More from ""The America We Need"" Countries confronting homelessness with greater success than the United States, including Finland and Japan, begin by treating housing as a human right. In the United States, by contrast, politicians decry the problem but aim for more modest goals. Mayor Bill de Blasio's promise to New York last December ""to end long-term street homelessness as we know it"" is a classic of the genre; most homeless people in the city live in shelters, not on the street. Reframing the debate -- asking what is necessary to end homelessness -- is an important first step for New York and for other places that are failing this basic test of civic responsibility. The next step is simple but expensive. The federal government already provides housing vouchers to help some lower-income families. The families pay 30 percent of their monthly income toward rent; the government pays the rest. But instead of giving vouchers to every needy family, the government imposes an arbitrary cap on total spending. Three in four eligible families don't get vouchers. The program costs about $19 billion a year. Vouchers for all eligible households would cost an additional $41 billion a year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2015. Where to get the money? Well, the government annually provides more than $70 billion in tax breaks to homeowners, including a deduction for mortgage interest payments and a free pass on some capital gains from home sales. Let's end homelessness instead of subsidizing mansions.

Vouchers alone, however, won't be enough. We also need more affordable housing. Without a significant expansion in the supply of housing, adding vouchers would be like adding players to a game of musical chairs without increasing the number of chairs. Market-rate construction can help: More housing would slow the upward march of housing prices. New York and San Francisco are the nation's most tightly regulated markets for housing construction, and it is not a coincidence that they also are the most expensive. Tokyo, often cited as an international model for its permissive development policies, has expanded its supply of homes by roughly 2 percent a year in recent years, while New York's housing supply has expanded by roughly 0.5 percent a year. Over the past two decades, housing prices in Tokyo held steady as New York prices soared.

But in the parts of the country that need affordable housing most desperately, construction will require significant public subsidies: land, tax credits, direct government spending. In California, for example, construction of a five-story apartment building that meets minimum standards costs an average of $425,000 per unit, according to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. Without public aid, the apartments would need to be rented for several times more than the $600 a month affordable to a family living at the poverty line. Proposals for a big increase in affordable housing construction inevitably call to mind the troubled public housing projects of the mid-20th century. They offer one clear lesson: Avoid housing that concentrates poverty. And there is a solution -- to build subsidized housing as part of mixed-income developments and to spread the developments out, putting them not just in cities but also in the surrounding suburbs. Helsinki, Finland, a city of just 600,000 people, builds about 7,000 units of mixed-income housing a year. That's a big reason Finland is the rare European country where homelessness is in decline. The government still will need to help those who fall into homelessness. Fortunately, we already know how to do that. Over the past decade, the federal government has conducted a highly successful campaign to reduce homelessness among veterans. The government reported in January that it had reduced the number of homeless veterans by 50 percent -- from about 75,000 in 2010 to about 37,000 at the end of 2019. Three states and several dozen cities have provided housing for their entire veteran populations.

As Ben Carson, secretary of housing and urban development, told Congress in May 2019, the success shows ""that homelessness is not an intractable problem -- we can end homelessness."" The program uses a triage approach, calibrating aid to need. The government provides up to $4,000 in cash for those who need just a little help, for example to pay a security deposit. For those who need continuing help, there are housing vouchers. And for veterans whose economic problems are compounded by other issues, such as disabilities or substance abuse, the government provides ""supportive housing"" -- a place to live, plus counseling and care. This is cheaper than leaving people to remain homeless and then intervening intermittently. One study found that in the two years after a person entered supportive housing in New York, he or she spent on average 83 fewer days in shelters, 28 fewer days in psychiatric hospitals and four fewer days in prison. Extending this approach to the entire homeless population would be expensive. To take one example, Washington's King County, which encompasses Seattle, would need to increase annual spending on homelessness to roughly $410 million from $196 million to help each of the county's 22,000 homeless families, according to a study by McKinsey. That's about $19,000 per family. For King County, that's a lot of money -- about 5 percent of its annual budget. For the federal government, it's a rounding error. Even if the cost per person were twice as high, the nation's homeless population could be housed for $10 billion a year -- less than the price of one aircraft carrier. The coronavirus pandemic has prompted a surge in spending on homelessness, thanks in part to $4 billion in emergency federal funding. Cities have converted convention centers into shelters and rented out hotel rooms to house the homeless. In Seattle, the city accelerated construction of a project to provide ""tiny houses"" for some homeless people. But there is worse to come. Homelessness rises during recessions, the federal funding is temporary, and state and local governments face huge drops in tax revenue.

Having failed to address homelessness during the longest economic expansion in American history, the nation now faces a greater challenge under more difficult circumstances. Yet the imperative remains: Everyone needs a home. No one should be left to die on the street. Americans must decide whether we are willing to let elementary school students spend nights in guarded parking lots, like ones I saw proliferating across the Western United States. We must decide whether it's worth spending just a little of this nation's vast wealth to ensure that no 60-year-old woman needs to sleep on the same bench in downtown Santa Monica, Calif., night after night because, as she explained to me, it's relatively flat and easy for the police to see her from their cars. We must decide whether it's tolerable for people to live in tents on the scraps of green space along a highway in Washington, D.C., just a short walk from the block where the richest man in America combined two mansions to create the city's largest. Addressing homelessness is within our power. The question is whether we are ready to act. Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) is a member of the editorial board.

12765,Sofia Kenin's Knack for Rebounds Is Being Tested at the French Open. And in 2020.,The coronavirus pandemic took away a window of opportunity for Sofia Kenin after she won the Australian Open in January. But she's still motivated.,Sofia Kenin won the Australian Open in January and is the top American woman left in the French Open after three rounds.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/03/sports/03french-kenin01/03french-kenin01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0a235bb3ca6b64d037f58165c1d86bd30716bf30aeb3c5d55770a011e0b97bb8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/sports/tennis/sofia-kenin-french-open.html,2399ed61-4979-5bfa-b719-d1b1050d6135.jpg,"The jeers, like the cheers, were refreshing after so many months of silence at tournaments like the United States Open, which was held without fans.

Kenin, like many of her peers, has already had enough of the ""bubble life.""

""I feel like all of us don't like it for sure,"" she said. ""We all want to go out, but we can't go out, because if you go out, you are disqualified and no one wants that of course. I know what to expect now with the mask and the social distancing and no crowds. But honestly, I feel like this is something I can never get used to, because this is completely not normal, and I obviously want it to be back to normal how it used to be. I miss the fans, really miss the fans.""

She also has missed a certain window of opportunity after winning her first Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open in early February, only to see sports shut down worldwide for months afterward.

""It was quite devastating, obviously it wasn't the best thing that happened, but this was the case for everybody and it just happened to be after I won,"" Kenin said. ""It is what it is. I try not to be so down, and just tried to keep myself motivated for once things would happen again.""

Her unexpected run in Australia was brilliant and often bold, including a win over the American teenager Coco Gauff, who has, fairly or not, seen a much bigger spotlight than Kenin for those interested in emerging American tennis stars.

Above all, Kenin came up with the goods in the third set of the final against Garbine Muguruza. Down 0-40 on her serve at 2-all, Kenin won five straight points: four with groundstroke winners and one with an ace to hold serve and then close out the victory.

It was one of the great games in Grand Slam history, but it seems like ancient history at this stage with the pandemic rendering sports an afterthought. Sponsorship deals for new arrivals like Kenin have become more difficult to secure and tournament appearance fees were wiped out during the hiatus."
40806,Review: Encores! Serves a Bathtub Martini in 'The New Yorkers',Cole Porter's lost musical from 1930 raises a glass to the giddy heyday of Prohibition and high (really high) society.,"Front from left, Kevin Chamberlin, Tam Mutu, Scarlett Strallen and Arnie Burton in ""The New Yorkers"" at City Center.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/24/arts/24NEWYORKERJP1/24NEWYORKERJP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=cb4ebd5e0a4b008a0e7d859b9ea79f884af403058f200c9cfb8b46ab09382401&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/theater/the-new-yorkers-review-encores.html,6b9a5735-bb7b-54e3-b531-6540d739735f.jpg,"So this is what Manhattan looked like in the tipsy yesterday of Prohibition, when drinking was an illicit thrill you couldn't get enough of, and the world was best seen through a martini glass -- preferably of cut crystal and filled to the sloshing point with bathtub gin. The view, I must say, is divine. Imbibe freely, all you kombucha-swilling health nuts of the 21st century, of the cocktail being served at City Center, where the delirious Encores! concert production of Cole Porter's ""The New Yorkers"" runs through Sunday. The only hangover symptom you'll feel is the blush that comes from having laughed incontinently at jokes that don't seem all that funny in the daylight. Directed by John Rando, with a choice cast of singing shtick artists, ""The New Yorkers"" makes the most puerile silliness seem deeply sophisticated and high sophistication look sublimely silly. It evokes those hedonistic early talking pictures, before the censors got their hands on Hollywood, when nobody appeared to have been told that the Jazz Age was over. Don't be fooled, though. This blithe and boozy production is a product of painstaking theater archaeology, by a team led by Jack Viertel, the Encores! artistic director. Working from salvaged, in some cases long-lost scripts and scores, Mr. Viertel, Mr. Rando and the music director Rob Berman have reanimated a show that seemed eternally down for the count after it ended its 168-performance Broadway run in 1931.

The effect is of attending one of those glamorous rooftop nightclubs where bright young things in black tie and tinsel gathered in the wee hours in Busby Berkeley and Astaire-Rogers movies. The floor shows that Fred and Ginger enjoyed in those films must have been a lot like ""The New Yorkers,"" a musical steeped in the energetic world weariness for which the name Cole Porter became a byword.

Porter's accomplices in creating this show included its star, Jimmy Durante; its book writer, Herbert Fields; and the New Yorker magazine cartoonist Peter Arno, who with E. Ray Goetz devised the original story. Arno was famous for his lascivious drawings of top-hatted sugar daddies and decolletage-flashing gold diggers. This musical's opening scene is one of those cartoons come to life. A ravishing young woman in a chic flapper-ish ensemble rushes into a medical examining room. Caption: ""Doctor, I'm sick, so you've simply got to examine me. Shall I strip?"" An unwelcome throwback to a best-forgotten era of sexist naughtiness? As it turns out, no one is merely a sex object in this tale of a romantic collision between high (really high) society and the underworld of bootleggers. Men and women alike have prodigious and actively indulged appetites for anything that might further the pursuit of a good time.

Alice Wentworth (the lady on the examining table, played to sparking soubrette perfection by Scarlett Strallen) has fallen hard for a hunky speakeasy-owning gangster, Al Spanish (Tam Mutu, in tasty shades of noir). Alice's mom, Gloria (Ruth Williamson), and pop, the filthy rich Windham (Byron Jennings), don't object to the liaison; they have their own dubious love affairs to focus on (with their torrid lovers played by Tyler Lansing Weaks and Robyn Hurder). But Alice is engaged to a doughy upper-crust type, Phillip Booster (Todd Buonopane), while Al has been keeping time with his club's chanteuse, the peerlessly named Mona Low (Mylinda Hull). Then there's the problem of those syndicate boys -- especially one Feet (short for Effete) McGeegan (Arnie Burton) -- who don't like Al's muscling in on their caviar empire. As the club headliner, Jimmie Deegan (Kevin Chamberlin), might say: ""Go figure! Ha-cha-cha-cha!"" Deegan was first played by Durante, who used his own songs (like ""The Hot Patata"") for ""The New Yorkers,"" and Mr. Chamberlin, without resorting to cheap impersonation, captures the zingy flavor of that top banana. It is he who ends the first act with an anarchic, tear-down-the-house number devoted to the all-American properties of wood. (Go on, chant along with him: ""Wood! Wood! Wood! Wood!"") And what does that have to do with the story? Really, need you ask? The plot here is just an excuse for talented singers, dancers and joke-slingers to show up in (and step out of) the gladdest of rags (Alejo Vietti did the costumes) and do do that voodoo that they do so well. That's a paraphrase from a Porter song that is not in this show, but could well have been. The interpolated Porter numbers include ""Night and Day"" and ""You've Got That Thing."" Among the original top-drawer selections from the show: ""Love for Sale"" (delivered with Billie Holiday reediness by the cabaret artist Cyrille Aimee), ""Take Me Back to Manhattan"" and ""Say It With Gin."" Such numbers are rendered with equal measures sass and satin by the Encores! orchestra, framed onstage by the white deco drapes of Allen Moyer's set, and perfectly matched by Chris Bailey's antic and graceful choreography. The lyrics and dialogue lean toward shameless double-entendres and smutty schoolboy puns."

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Given its enormous size and shiny black paint, it would have been hard to miss the '67 Lincoln Continental convertible parked in front of the W Hotel in Scottsdale, Ariz. It was a polished head-turner, and the Nascar driver Denny Hamlin, in town that early March weekend for a Sprint Cup race at Phoenix International Raceway, could not help noticing. He took a picture and posted it on Twitter. ""I knew it was the car that was the same body type and everything of the car in 'Entourage,' "" Hamlin said, referring to the suicide-door Continental used in the HBO television series. ""I always liked that car.""

All of which suggests that Nascar drivers aren't driven by speed alone. They're car people, too. With his spur-of-the-moment purchase, Hamlin joined a select group of current drivers who also own classic cars. Among the stalwart members of that group are Dale Earnhardt Jr., Tony Stewart, Jimmie Johnson and Ryan Newman. It's not only the veteran drivers who own vintage models, though -- even 23-year-old Joey Logano has caught the bug. Newman might be the leader among this pack of current Cup drivers. He said that his collection was around 17 or 18 cars, including a '31 Ford woody, a '39 Hudson and breakthrough models like a 1949 Jaguar XK 120. He also has a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible that was a gift from his wife on his 30th birthday in 2007. A standout among his holdings is a 1957 Dodge Super D 500, powered by a 325-cubic-inch Hemi V-8 with dual four-barrel carburetors, ""which is pretty rare, because it's a stick shift,"" Newman said. ""They were all push-button automatics back then.""

Unlike some of the other drivers who own classic cars, Newman likes to restore them, too. ""There are cars that I have that are 100 percent restored that I bought like that,"" he said. ""There are cars that I've bought that needed to be restored, and there's cars that I have that need to be restored, and there's cars that I have that never will be and they're just originals. ""I just like 'em because they're cool and I can work on them,"" Newman said. Johnson, on the other hand, laughed when asked if he got under the hood of the 1949 Chevrolet pickup that he drives around Charlotte, N.C., where most of the drivers live during the season. ""It's a '49, still-original cab -- it has the five windows,"" Johnson said of the truck he uses most days.""I love that truck. ""Work on it? Come on, are you crazy? I put gas in it, put air in the tires."" Logano said he didn't do much work on his vehicles, either. He owns a 1972 Chevrolet Suburban, but he especially prizes his 1959 Cadillac convertible, white with a red interior.

Logano said he learned to appreciate classic cars growing up in Connecticut. His father, Tom Logano, owned a 1962 Corvette that he let Joey drive when he was only 9 years old. That turned out to be a mistake when Joey asked to move the car to the front of the house before they went out for ice cream one day. ""I'd driven it a million times -- which was funny, I was 9 -- but around the neighborhood,"" Logano recalled. ""And so I just parked it in front of the house, went and started shooting hoops. Came back like a half an hour later, the car's gone. Where's the car?"""

Last year, in July, a month after the protests over an extradition bill began in Hong Kong, I renewed the lease on my flat. For the first time since I turned 18, I would be living in the same apartment for more than two years. It felt like an accomplishment, like I was a real adult. My place is almost 300 square feet, and it has a view of trees and steps, which is such an improvement from my last flat that sometimes just looking out the window makes me emotional. I ordered a cheap Ikea carpet and put up old posters. I started buying vinyl records and physical books again. I could be here for a while. It began to feel like home. There are so many reasons Hong Kong is not a particularly habitable city, so many reasons you might want to leave, even without the Chinese Communist Party threatening to throw dissidents in jail. Windowless apartments, subdivided flats, bunk beds. If you have children, your choice is either to send them to local schools, where they face an unforgiving education system, or international schools, which can cost as much as $13,000 a year. The high rents or archaic land regulations and bureaucracy can force out anyone trying to run an independent space for music, art and expression. Rates of depression have recently reached a 10-year high, but quality mental health care is too expensive for ordinary people.

I am 27 now, and when I was younger, I desperately wanted to leave Hong Kong. I grew up in a neighborhood that, at the time, felt like a cultural backwater. There were no bookstores, no art, no record shops. I attended a conservative Christian school and never really fit in. I went to concerts alone. I wrote fan fiction and spent all my time on Tumblr. I thought I wanted to go to school in London or New York, where I'd finally find ""my people."" The longest I've ever managed to be away from the city was four months, for an exchange semester in Scotland. I never really ended up going anywhere. But that was OK, because eventually I did find my people. I met community activists and other young creative types who showed me an alternative way of living in Hong Kong. I became a regular at the cha chaan teng diners in my neighborhood, where I'd be given a second bowl of soup at dinner once the staff found out that I didn't live with my family. There were local musicians whose shows I'd never miss. In university, I began going to protests. There is an annual march on July 1, the anniversary of the British ""handover"" of Hong Kong to the Chinese, and soon I took it for granted that about this time every year, I would be marching through the streets in the sticky heat. I belonged, and I was proud to be here and not anywhere else. Hong Kong was still unforgiving, but we could expand the space for what is possible here.

This year, on the evening of June 30, the condolences started coming in. Earlier that day, China had passed the new national security law, which took effect within hours. The sky had cracked with a coral sunset that seeped into the horizon like a warning. Friends living abroad sent me texts: I'm so sorry, hope you're OK, thinking of you. Restaurants started peeling protest stickers off their glass windows. Some writers I know have been trying to scrub their work from the internet and deleting their chat records. The law is broad and gives China new ways to punish protesters and silence dissent. Former classmates are discussing immigration plans or getting married, so that if they need to, they can flee with their partners. Others are figuring out how to renew their British National Overseas passports, the documents issued to Hong Kongers born before 1997, which could allow them to stay in Britain for five years. Before the new law made the chant ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" possibly illegal, my favorite place to hear it was at tiny music clubs, ""livehouses"" that stink of beer and sweat at the end of the night. After the encores, the last guitar note still reverberating, someone would yell the first half of the slogan, and others would answer in unison. At the end of December, I celebrated New Year's Eve at a small pro-protest cafe where a friend played the unofficial protest anthem, ""Glory to Hong Kong,"" and everyone sang along. After six months of street protests and police violence, we were all exhausted, but it still felt like we were on the cusp of change. I was 10 when the Hong Kong government tried to introduce a national security law in 2003, and it was quickly withdrawn after half a million people took to the streets in protest. That proposal was a sword that hung over us for nearly two decades, a threat to what Hong Kongers hold most dear -- a culture of protest, the rule of law, freedom. We've been fighting for ""freedom,"" that abstract concept, for so long, with no idea of what losing it would look like. It was delivered with devastating speed -- the whole process took less than two months -- in the form of a 66-article piece of legislation that we had no say in. Hong Kongers, academics and overseas commentators say this is the endgame, that after this law, Hong Kong will be ""dead.""

But not everything has disappeared. The bookshop near my flat posted a message on social media: ""Life goes on, resist fear."" A reporter I know tweeted, ""I'll just try my best to pretend this law doesn't exist, keep calm, and carry on."" I don't want to downplay how terrifying the national security law is. People were arrested under that law on the first day, some of them just for carrying a flag bearing suddenly ""outlawed"" slogans. Courts can deny bail and hold secret trials. No one knows how to navigate this new reality. Yet people are already coming up with cheeky, humorous ways of circumventing the new rules, resisting the temptation to be too obedient and give in to the chilling effect. We will continue to find defiance in unexpected places. Over the past week, I have read report after report about how there would be an exodus of Hong Kongers from the city after the law was passed. But leaving is not an option for the young people who don't already have British or B.N.O. passports or whose families don't have the means to send them abroad to study. Ahkok Wong, a musician-social activist I know, actually moved back to Hong Kong recently, telling me, ""I think it's an important time to be here."" Life in Hong Kong has always been about demanding the impossible, trying to make seeds blossom in cement, he says.

I used to see leaving as abandonment, but the cost of staying could now potentially be life imprisonment. When Nathan Law announced that he had left the city, I thought about the last time I saw him, a month ago, canvassing for an upcoming election at Hill Road. I wish I had stayed longer to thank him for trying to make this city more habitable. Four years ago, when elections still seemed to matter, I had voted for him, to make him the youngest legislator ever elected in Hong Kong, before he was disqualified. There will be new forms of resistance, here or elsewhere, and I know he will be a part of them. I remember the night before July 1, it seemed like all my friends were posting the same song on social media, a cover by the Hong Kong band My Little Airport. It goes,  In between the verses, there is an archival recording of Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, saying, ""Now Hong Kong people are to run Hong Kong, that is the promise and that is the unshakable destiny."" That promise has been broken, but this is not the end. We will continue to make a home out of an imperfect place. To wipe down the mold, repaint the walls. One day we could be forcibly evicted, or this could all burn to the ground. But for now, we're still here. Maybe we can still try to make this place beautiful.

Sebastian Nicolas, 35, an original partner from the Box, the burlesque club on the Lower East Side, hopes to bring a little of that mystery back with a live music ""listening room"" called Subrosa.

Sharing the same address on Gansevoort Street as Bar Nana, but beneath it in an old garage, this bar brings a refreshing bohemian breeze to the neighborhood, along with a distinctly Latin beat.

A few steps from the High Line. Subrosa is marked by a red neon sign, which leads to a series of landings that descend dramatically to the basement, where Mr. Nicolas has created a postmodern beatnik's cavern of whitewashed brick walls in rosy hues. Low red couches and bronze mirrored tables are set before a modest stage. Spontaneous salsa dancing is encouraged.

The usual meatpacking district suspects (ladies with big handbags and big blond hair, guys in fashionable hoodies and expensive jeans) are mixed in with mature, more upscale couples who came for the live music. On a recent Thursday visit, one older woman in a black beret and a leopard-patterned skirt danced solo for a while, deeply feeling the beat."

The nation's gross domestic product, a key indicator of economic strength, expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. The expansion defied concerns that hurricanes in Texas and Florida would put a damper on output. Republicans called the report a sign that businesses were already spending more in anticipation of a corporate tax cut, and evidence that the economy could grow faster over the long term than currently forecast. ""If you look at the G.D.P. data, it's clear that is a major reason,"" Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, asserted on Friday. Many economists, however, are reluctant to give Congress or the administration too much credit for the economy's trajectory.

The economy is experiencing its fastest growth spurt in two consecutive quarters since 2014, after hitting 3.1 percent in the spring, a level that prompted President Trump to suggest that ""we're really on our way"" to sustaining that pace year-round. ""On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent,"" Mr. Trump said during a speech in Missouri in August. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. But economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent. The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent. With legislation embodying the party's tax proposals expected next week, the figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their policy: They are celebrating faster growth while arguing that tax reform is needed to accelerate it further.

Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that ""our economy produced solid growth last quarter"" and went on to say that tax reform was a way to ""continue this growth"" and ""reinvigorate America's economy."" On Friday, Mr. Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers released projections of how one prospective provision of the tax plan -- a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent -- would affect economic growth. They said it would expand output by 3 to 5 percent over the long run, a period left unspecified. The complication is that faster growth could undermine the party's case that tax cuts are needed to add fuel to an economy that is already running with low unemployment -- and it could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly, which could dampen the effects of any tax bill. Liberal economists said the report showed the success of Ms. Yellen at the Fed and undermined the case for the Republican tax bill. ""The underlying trend in G.D.P. growth is clearly telling us two things,"" Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email. ""Keep on rockin' steady with Yellen at the Fed, and there's no need for a big, wasteful tax cut."" The Fed, judging that the economy is growing about as fast as it can, is on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December to a level Fed officials have described as likely neither to encourage nor to discourage growth. The Fed's plans do not reflect the potential economic impact of a tax cut. Aside from the details of the legislation, the Fed's reaction may also depend on its leadership. Mr. Trump is expected to announce next week whom he will nominate to lead the Fed after Ms. Yellen's term ends in early February. The growth figure released on Friday was the government's first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice. Economists initially expected that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma would deal a blow to the country's steady growth -- a prospect reinforced by a net job loss in September -- but became more optimistic in recent weeks.

After the shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output. After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year. ""If you don't go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. ""If you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy."" Understand Inflation and How It Affects You

The job market is lively, and the stock market has rallied to record highs. Chief executives and consumers are more confident than they have been in more than a decade, recent surveys show. ""There are no real headwinds to growth for the first time since the expansion began,"" said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics. ""We are at full employment and we are in full swing; let the good times roll."" Spending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements. One reason companies may be investing more in their business is that the labor market has tightened and wages are rising. ""Businesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies,"" said Mr. Anderson of Bank of the West. Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust 3.9 percent. Mr. Zandi said the numbers were ""a sign that consumers are hanging tough.""

""Things are picking up -- I sense it in Europe,"" Mr. Ickert said. He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filtered down to rural communities. ""Trade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business,"" he said. The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent. And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year. ""This is happening globally,"" Mr. Zandi, the Moody's economist, said. ""There isn't a single major economy that is in recession."""
58250,A Witness to Gentrification in Cobble Hill,"Peggy White, a longtime resident of Warren Street, offers a window onto the evolution of a neighborhood.",Peggy White lives in the Cobble Hill house in which she — and her mother before her — grew up.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/08/realestate/08DEBRIEF/08DEBRIEF-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=405&w=600&s=f6b4cea6028bf2c7b7d46e682cf5b120e5ef238594ca2aafe6d3acdbb6a91a0b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/realestate/a-witness-to-gentrification-in-cobble-hill.html,c38e3a41-f2e2-573e-83af-cd815a4a7bdb.jpg,"In the morning, when Peggy White makes her way down Court Street in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, to the no-frills coffee shop where she likes to linger with friends, it can take her an hour to walk five blocks. This is not because Ms. White, who is sensitive about her age but has been walking these streets since the 1940s, is slowed by ailments, but because she is such a popular figure in the community. With her pale blue eyes and cropped red hair, she is a fixture in these parts, and nearly everyone she passes offers a wave or a greeting. ""To be honest, I don't absolutely remember all of them,"" Ms. White said. ""But I say hello anyway."" Her popularity is not surprising, because her roots in the neighborhood run deep. In 1916, her maternal grandparents moved to Warren Street and in the early 1920s bought a red brick town house on the block between Court and Smith Streets that dates back to the mid-1800s. Except for a several-decades-long interlude in Flushing, Queens, during her marriage, Ms. White has lived in the house her entire life. As witness to the changes that have washed over the block, she offers a window onto the evolution of a strip of town houses whose fortunes say a great deal about the real estate market in brownstone Brooklyn, and, with inventory tight, the voracious appetite for homes with a past. And she is experiencing firsthand the sometimes edgy relationship between the declining population of long-timers and the growing number of well-heeled newcomers replacing them.

The block long sidestepped the gentrification that has transformed so much of brownstone Brooklyn, in part because its houses are more modest than some and commercial structures sit at the ends of the block. But given today's super-tight market, along with selling points like first-rate schools and transportation and the vibrant mix of stores and restaurants on Court and Smith Streets, the block sits squarely in the sights of developers and buyers. With the grande dames in the Cobble Hill Historic District to the west largely snapped up, hungry home buyers are looking eastward. On this block of Warren Street, the future nibbles greedily at the past. Thanks to this frenzy, scaffolding or construction sheds routinely frame one or more buildings. Construction permits herald cellar-to-roof renovations. Carpenters and masons create a near-constant din and whip up billowing clouds of dust. ""At one point, there were Dumpsters here from 7:30 in the morning until 6 at night,"" Ms. White said. ""It was like the Wild West on this street."" Fliers from entities that describe themselves as investment groups and bear teasing come-ons like ""Thinking of selling your house!! $$$ I PAY TOP DOLLAR $$$"" -- some hand-scrawled on logo-less sheets of paper -- are stuffed under doors and wedged through mail slots. Because of the growing population of children, small creatures on bikes and skateboards whiz by so briskly that Ms. White fears being sent sprawling to the ground. Court Street reminds her increasingly of a street in Manhattan, and that's not a compliment. On a more profound level, she mourns the transformation of a patch of the city that, in her eyes, has seemingly overnight become disrupted and ever less neighborly.

It's not the newcomers per se that trouble her. ""Some of the new people are lovely,"" she said. ""But they rush around so much. I've gotten to know some of them and they've very nice. But they're so busy."" Retracing her past puts Ms. White in a more cheerful mood. She likes to think of the years around 1900 when her mother's parents made the journey to New York from Ireland, and the time they bought the three-family house on Warren Street, in the neighborhood everyone called Downtown Brooklyn, for perhaps $7,000. Ms. White's mother grew up there and so did Ms. White, who was born in nearby Long Island College Hospital. The backyard, planted with tulips and roses, was so beautiful that Ms. White's father, who came from Sligo, used to say he wanted to be buried there. Ms. White attended school at nearby St. Paul's, the church where both she and her mother were married. Stroll with Ms. White along Court Street and she can tell you story after story; every building sparks a memory. The Montessori school? ""That used to be a lamp factory."" BookCourt, the popular independent bookstore? ""Oh, that was the Rooneys' place. They had a flower shop in that store that went back to the late 19th century. And one of the Rooney boys became a congressman and served a long time."" Ms. White also remembers the mix who called the neighborhood home -- many Irish and Italians but also Syrians, Lebanese, Scandinavians, Germans and Puerto Ricans. ""And we never had any problems with each other,"" Ms. White said. ""Kids fought, but it was healthy fighting.""

During her years in Queens, she visited the family house every weekend -- her beloved twin brother, Hugh, made his home in the Rockaways -- and after her husband's death in 2004, she returned to the house for good. Predictably, the changes that so distress Ms. White are viewed differently by real estate brokers, who regard this stretch of Warren Street as a lively little boomtown with an exciting future. ""It's not the perfect bucolic, tree-lined street,"" said Leslie Marshall of the Corcoran Group. ""But people are drawn to that."" The exodus of longtime owners is encouraging buying low and gut-renovating, a practice made easier by the absence of a landmark designation. Corcoran sold 295 Warren Street for $1.73 million in February and 309 Warren Street, which had already been renovated, for $2.73 million the following month. Like a sturdy reed in a fierce wind, Ms. White's house has withstood the storm. The mortgage has long been paid off. And some years ago, she got the place repainted and rewired. But upkeep and even basic repairs are constant concerns. ""There's always something to tackle,"" Ms. White said. ""I just want it to be decent. But everything's an ordeal."" She tosses the unwelcome fliers into the garbage -- ""I don't need the money and I could care less,"" she explained -- but she watches uneasily as other long-timers struggle to adapt to a shifting landscape. ""A woman who lived in Carroll Gardens all her life, she had to move to Wisconsin,"" Ms. White said. ""I felt so badly for her."" She herself hopes to stay as long as she can. ""Where would I go?"" she said. ""And really, why would I leave? People say, 'Aren't you afraid?' I'm not afraid. I know the sounds. I hear people going to the subway. I'm very comfortable here."""

It's perfectly obvious that Prince's 1979 acoustic demo for ""I Feel for You"" -- which originally appeared on his self-titled album, and went to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 when Chaka Khan recorded it in 1984 -- would be stunning. Here is Prince singing sweetly but softly, and playing a more intricate rhythmic line on guitar than the eventual popularized version had room for. And yet after those first two minutes comes two and a half minutes of something else: pure vamping, light scat singing, an easy lesson in getting lost in the rhythm. The first part of this recording has the affirming feel of the familiar; this second part is full of hope for things not yet -- and maybe never to be -- heard. JON CARAMANICA

Tiptoeing, then marching, then swelling, then pounding in double time through two chords, ""Walking on a String"" is, as Matt Berninger of the National notes at the end of the video clip, a ""spider metaphor"": romance as a foredoomed meeting of predator and prey. But with Berninger's low purr and Phoebe Bridgers's knowing whisper, they do sound fond of each other, fatal or not. JON PARELES

A tender, almost whimsy-filled read on the electro of early-to-mid 1980s Los Angeles by the producer Vegyn. A Frank Ocean collaborator on ""Blonde"" and ""Endless,"" earlier this year he released ""Text While Driving if You Want to Meet God!,"" a cluster of synth-pop vignettes that show curiosity about what happens when the tones of dance music are reconfigured and put in service of emotional sketches. On this new song, he extracts the sentimentality of quiet-storm R&B and sets it to an uplifting bop, like being swaddled by a firm gust of wind. CARAMANICA

The Midnight Hour unites two producers, Ali Shaheed Muhammad (from A Tribe Called Quest) and Adrian Younge. ""Harmony"" is a brisk, jazzy track with Loren Oden singing in a tentative falsetto about a one-night stand that surprisingly might lead somewhere: ""It was only for a night/now we're in harmony."" Orchestrated with strings, horns and even a harp, it's hip-hop that embraces harmonic and rhythmic mobility along with romance. PARELES

""Memory is a most unusual thing,"" the alto saxophonist Matana Roberts muses on ""As Far as the Eye Can See"" as the scrape of violin strings and what sounds like a mouth-harp create a drone beneath her. Yet despite all its mystery, memory also feels palpably alive in Roberts's music: Stories from the distant past are vested with a kind of heady impatience usually reserved for the present. Roberts has just released the fourth volume in her ""Coin Coin"" suite, a planned 12-album exploration of the story of her family (and, by extension, her country) through a mix of singing, spoken words, group improvising and electronics that she calls ""panoramic sound quilting."" GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Katy Perry's search for a sound that's both au courant and also not ill fitting continues with ""Harleys in Hawaii,"" a convincing enough quasi-SoundCloud R&B number with light reggae swing. Her singing is breathy and casual, and in moments, sweet. But her presence is vague, melting into the groove. It's what happens when you primarily inhabit other people's ideas -- not in and of itself a meritless thing, but dangerous territory for a top-shelf pop star losing her grip. It doesn't help that the video is vividly derailed by what appears to be very prominent product placement by Cheetos. CARAMANICA

A looped vocal sample shuttles back and forth in stereo, chirping and trilling. It interrupts and defamiliarizes the sustained melody that Chloe Kaul coos over a few piano notes and a chattering beat. It also acts out the way that the lyrics have her shuttling between separation -- ""I never want to be the stop in your life plans"" -- and reunion -- ""never say never."" The song's last dissonant notes don't guarantee any outcome. PARELES Two jazz piano masters whose studious, tradition-grounded styles have always made them a little too easy to take for granted, Kenny Barron and Mulgrew Miller gave a smattering of rare duet performances in Europe in the years before Miller's untimely death in 2013. Recordings from those concerts have just been released as ""The Art of Piano Duo: Live,"" a three-CD set full of lively, tussling renditions of jazz standards. Barron and Miller are two nonpareil accompanists, but they're also freewheeling improvisers who relish a good disruption: They can give each other breathing room, and then cut in swiftly to fill it all up again. The collection ends with a fleet take on ""Joy Spring,"" by Clifford Brown. RUSSONELLO"

So much so that it's no longer just a company. The institution has tiers, as showcased Wednesday during the inaugural Ailey Spirit Gala at the David H. Koch Theater, where the main company shared the stage with members of Ailey II, the Ailey School and AileyCamp.

But just what is an Ailey Spirit Gala? Artistically, the evening -- as shallow as spirit day at summer camp -- had less to do with actual dancing than with distractions. Before the show, a workshop on Lincoln Center's Josie Robertson Plaza was led by the former Ailey dancer Nasha Thomas-Schmitt, who taught parts of three sections of Ailey's 1960 work ""Revelations."" She was tough, but got results. ""Watch!"" Ms. Thomas-Schmitt urged the participants, including a woman in a wheelchair.

Robert Battle, the company's artistic director, referred to the scene in the plaza in a speech: ""Do we know how to make an entrance?"" he said. True enough, the posters for American Ballet Theater in front of the Metropolitan Opera House suddenly seemed staid.

The program began with students from the company's summer program, AileyCamp, performing choreography inspired by Ronald K. Brown's 1999 work ""Grace,"" as staged by Ms. Thomas-Schmitt. Dressed in white and red, the young dancers did little more than evoke phrases from that piece -- a quiet bow of the head gave way to explosive hip thrusts -- yet their devotion was convincing, especially from Christopher Taylor. The last to leave the stage, he breezily spun around, plucked at his pants and sauntered into the wings. He's just 14, and he's already cool."
50085,Philanthropic Group Asks Rich Women for Work as Well as Money,"In an unusual approach for a nonprofit, the Maverick Collective also asks its donors to give their time and expertise to the organizations they fund.","Pam Scott at the San Francisco office of Ideo.org, where she is on the board. She is also a member of the Maverick Collective.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/05/business/06WEALTH/06WEALTH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=9f6febde5dbfeb1e283fc931694aa70a1fef396fa9bee01c1f78206ac13ec964&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/your-money/philanthropic-group-asks-rich-women-for-work-as-well-as-money.html,ed6ebe3b-1f3b-560c-a827-a41caea57684.jpg,"PAM SCOTT, a marketing consultant, has worked with global brands like American Express, Nike and Levi's to help them connect better with their customers. She has also served on nonprofit boards and is co-manager of the Koogle Foundation with her husband, Timothy A. Koogle, the first executive of Yahoo. But she recently got a request that would combine the two experiences: Commit three years of her time, give at least $1 million and do actual work to solve a social problem. Most charitable organizations seek the involvement of donors, to keep them giving and perhaps persuade some to serve as trustees, but the invitation Ms. Scott received was to become one of the first members of the Maverick Collective, a group of wealthy women who are required to become involved in the organizations they fund.

Ms. Scott said the request was so different that she was intrigued. ""I just got the tour so many times,"" she said of past courtships by nonprofit groups. ""It seems,"" she said, that charitable organizations often keep people with money ""at arm's length and just let them see what they want to see."" ""As someone who has been a thought partner for some of the best companies in the world,"" she added, ""it was really frustrating that I couldn't give away some of the services that I'd been paid well for by companies."" But the Maverick Collective wanted the women to give their expertise. The group was created by Population Services International, a global nonprofit organization that focuses on family health and planning in the developing world. (Melinda Gates and Princess Mette-Marit of Norway are co-chairwomen of the Maverick initiative.) ""Money alone is not going to solve problems,"" said Kate Roberts, senior vice president for corporate partnerships and philanthropy at Population Services International. ""We believed we had a real opportunity to look at the promising solutions around girls and women and create the first collective of smart, bold women to use their money and skills to end extreme poverty in their lifetime.""

Such an idea is not without major risks. For one, what do people who have made millions in industries very different from the nonprofit world know about solving social problems? Even without asking for help, nonprofit organizations can struggle with board members who meddle in staff matters. Inviting real involvement in the day-to-day workings of an organization can be a recipe for disaster. Donors ""feel they can lend a hand given their skill set, and they have a desire to do it,"" said Marguerite Griffin, director of philanthropic advisory services at Northern Trust Wealth Management. ""It can be challenging from the nonprofit's standpoint. They know what they need to do to get the work done. They want the donor to be engaged. It's invaluable. But it comes at a cost."" Ms. Scott's involvement was initially met with skepticism by the people she would be working with in Tanzania, not least of all because she lived in San Francisco -- a 10-hour time difference. ""I had a preconceived idea,"" said Melissa Higbie, a deputy country director for Population Services International in Tanzania. ""I thought, how are we going to communicate and stay engaged? We weren't going to ask her how to do this in a flexible way. But she said, 'I'll get up at 6 a.m. so you can work.'""

In doing that every week, Ms. Scott built trust with the Population Services International team, Ms. Higbie said. She has also regularly visited Tanzania and worked directly to coach Ms. Higbie's staff members when they had problems. Ms. Scott said she knew she had to be involved to build trust but also to understand what needed to be done. ""If you don't get eye to eye and shoulder to shoulder with the people on the ground, you're going to make a lot of mistakes,"" she said. Her marketing expertise is in something called ""human-centered design."" At its simplest, that involves asking customers what they want, instead of guessing and trying to persuade them to buy the product anyway. Her project in Tanzania was aimed at reducing teenage pregnancy. Initially, she tried to think of ways to create more demand among teenagers for contraceptives, but then she realized that the problem was coming from medical workers. ""Almost all the providers have a lot of empathy for girls, but what we found was empathy was causing them to adopt a concern for women that was counterproductive,"" she said. ""They were concerned about the girls' most important asset, their fertility. There were a lot of providers who thought it might be harmful to give them contraceptives because it might harm their fertility.""

This was what Population Services International hoped would happen. ""We don't consider our Mavericks donors,"" Ms. Roberts said. ""We consider them part of the team. Our members are helping us build the car while we are driving it."" Population Services International did not arrive at this model quickly. The process was the opposite of the way it and other nonprofits typically approach a problem, which is to present their solution and seek funding for it -- without knowing for sure if that solution really is a solution. Yasmin Madan, global marketing director for Population Services International, said the Mavericks came about after the organization realized that ""the current range of products and services wasn't enough."" ""There was some hesitation to open the hood and show how the engine works,"" Ms. Madan said. ""That's not how we typically work. This was an evolution in P.S.I.'s thinking to say, 'This isn't working. We're hitting a roadblock here. There has to be something different.'"" So it went scouting for women who could give at least $1 million over three years but were also committed to social change. Indrani Goradia, who lives in Texas, had already started a foundation, Indrani's Light, to train workers at domestic abuse shelters so they could help without succumbing to compassion fatigue. As part of the collective, she can take this idea to India. Diane Powell, a social worker and volunteer, said that after her husband had a big payday at a biotechnology company, they began looking for ways to give. Her husband, who heard Ms. Roberts speak at a conference, approached her, and soon Ms. Powell was part of the collective. She has taken on a project in Senegal to reduce the maternal mortality rate.

Population Services International made sure that everyone knew what was expected so donors and staff members could work together. Concerns about donor meddling are real, but so, too, is the risk that donors will become bored or feel underused. At the same time, a donor may come to feel trapped and see the involvement as a burden. ""You may want to ask if you're involved in a way that is meaningful for you,"" said Kenneth E. Spruill Jr., manager of private foundations at Hawthorn, the private wealth division of the PNC Financial Services Group. ""People's lives ebb and flow. If you've got young children, your involvement may torque back a bit. You can get compassion fatigue."" To this end, Ms. Griffin at Northern Trust Wealth Management said she often suggests that donors limit their involvement to a certain number of times a month or quarter. And she said that ""discrete opportunities"" can be more effective. Ms. Scott said she had looked at her involvement like one of her business projects: a chance to solve a problem. ""I hope that the work that I'm doing with P.S.I. has two outcomes,"" she said. ""One, we really realize our dreams and put a significant dent in teenage pregnancy in Tanzania and, secondly, I hope that P.S.I. embraces the idea of human-centered design."""
58372,When Converting a Roth I.R.A.

Just ask all those people who rushed to make large tax-free gifts to family members at the end of last year before a historically high exemption was set to expire. Not only did the exemption not end, but it was increased for 2013. And there was no way to get those tax-driven gifts back. One exception to the no-do-over rule involves the Roth I.R.A. When people move money from a tax-deferred I.R.A. to a tax-free Roth, they pay income taxes on the amount they transfer. Because the move has huge tax implications, the federal government gives people a chance each year to change their minds if they do it within a certain period of time. Over the last three years, planners pushed the conversion idea especially hard with clients because of certain tax advantages. And some people might have been pushed harder than they should have been. Those who made the conversion to Roth -- and now regret it -- will have until Oct. 15 to change their minds and get back the taxes they paid. But undoing it, even if it makes financial sense, may be hard for some people to even consider. For many tax-driven investors, it probably took a lot of persuading from accountants and advisers to get comfortable with paying up to 35 percent of the account value in federal taxes.

With the deadline to ""recharacterize"" a Roth, to use industry jargon, fast approaching, I wanted to take a look at some of the questions surrounding Roths before and after Oct. 15. Should anyone have second thoughts, if retirement investing is the ultimate in long-term planning, or should a conversion be seen as just another financial strategy? Are there risks to undoing a transfer? And now that income tax rates have risen, are Roth conversions less attractive going forward? THE ROTH RUSH To understand why voluntarily paying a large tax bill on retirement savings was attractive last year, you have to first understand the difference in how money put into and taken out of traditional and Roth I.R.A.'s is treated. In a traditional individual retirement account, money is put in before taxes are paid; when it is withdrawn after a person turns 59  1/2, it is taxed as income. Those who do not need the money in their 60s can wait until they are 70  1/2, at which point there is an annual required minimum distribution that is calculated based on life expectancy. But that will make the withdrawals bigger and the tax rate higher. If that I.R.A. is passed on to heirs, they still have to pay income tax on the withdrawals and the account will be considered part of the estate. More on Social Security and Retirement

These online tools can help you figure out your income needs and when to file In a Roth I.R.A., money is put in after taxes are paid and is later withdrawn tax-free. There are no required distributions. It is also included in an estate, but when it passes to heirs they can make withdrawals free of income tax. Therefore, to convert from a traditional I.R.A. to a Roth I.R.A., you need to pay the income taxes you did not pay when that money was originally put in. The amounts can be large and can put people into a higher tax bracket for the year. The certainty of higher income tax rates in 2013 made the conversion attractive last year: high earners, in particular, could pay federal tax at 35 percent instead of the current 39.6 percent. (They also owed state taxes, but the amount depended on their state.)

""It takes a client who understands the importance of converting something from tax-deferred to tax-free and paying the taxes upfront,"" said Winnie Sun, managing director of Sun Group Wealth Partners. ""It's a pretty prudent client who understands that it's better to convert your I.R.A. and pay the taxes now."" CHANGING YOUR MIND Yet even though proponents say there are people for whom such a conversion makes a lot sense, there are others who did not think it through fully. People who should not undo their Roth conversion -- and may want to consider additional conversions if they can stomach the tax -- generally fall into three categories: They have other investments to live on. When they are forced to take distributions, they will end up paying tax at a higher rate on money they do not need. Or, ultimately, they would like to leave their retirement account to their heirs. There is a subset that could temporarily be in a low tax bracket, and a conversion for heirs might make sense. John Napolitano, chief executive of U.S. Wealth Management, gave the example of an executive who retires at 64 and has a few years of deferred compensation being paid to him. ""Once they're done taking out their deferred compensation, their tax bracket is pretty low,"" he said. ""If they go from 40 percent to 28 percent, I'd recommend a partial Roth conversion and they pay taxes at a lower rate than they're used to."" People who might want to reconsider are those who find that their life has changed in an unexpected way and they need that tax payment back, and those who have seen the value of their Roth conversion fall. Karen Cady, leader of Plante Moran's wealth management and tax services group, said she had a client get cold feet after converting his entire I.R.A. to a Roth last year. ""At his age and stage in life, he looked at it and said, 'I'm 40 and I don't want to take $500,000 out of my other assets to insure a lockup of my I.R.A. for my heirs. I'm just not comfortable writing the check.' "" People who watched their account's value fall after converting to Roth are in an intriguing situation, since chances are not all of their investments went down. To anticipate this, Robert S. Keebler, a certified public accountant and partner with Keebler & Associates in Green Bay, Wis., said he advised clients to split their retirement account into separate Roth I.R.A.'s by asset class. Now, ahead of the Oct. 15 deadline, he is advising clients on which accounts to undo and which ones to let stand, he said.

""Maybe they have $1 million in retirement assets, and they only want to do $300,000,"" Mr. Keebler said. ""We'll convert all $1 million of it knowing we'll recharacterize $700,000 because we don't know what $300,000 we're going to keep."" BEST STRATEGIES For accountants and advisers who work with wealthier clients, the conversion of large I.R.A.'s into Roth accounts resembles the plans advisers put in place to diversify large concentrations of a single stock: they happen methodically, regularly and in a highly disciplined way. And they will continue even though income taxes have risen. Michael E. Goodman, a certified public accountant and the president of Wealthstream Advisors, says he has a client who is a 45-year-old widow with children who looks each year at how much she can convert from a traditional retirement account to a Roth. Since she makes large charitable donations, she is often able to use the tax deduction to offset some of the tax bill from the Roth conversion. ""It's much more powerful for my client at 45 than at 65,"" he said, pointing out that it takes years for investment gains to surpass the tax losses. The exception is someone who is doing the conversion for heirs, who will have a longer time horizon. Another benefit comes to people who own small businesses and can use operating losses to offset the tax on larger Roth conversions, said Charlie J. Massimo, chief executive of CJM Wealth Management. ""Coming off a couple of bad years, there were quite a few businesses that had carry-forward, net operating losses,"" Mr. Massimo said. ""Some of them were able to make a tax-free conversion because they could use the net operating losses to pay the taxes.""

FUTURE CONVERSIONS While many of the long-term planning reasons for converting a traditional I.R.A. to a Roth still hold true even with higher income tax rates, there are more caveats. Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst & Young, said he warned clients about what he called ""collateral tax damage"" from a Roth conversion. There has always been a risk that a conversion puts the person in a higher income tax bracket, Mr. Rosica said. For someone who normally earns $100,000 and converts $400,000 to a Roth, he is taxed as if he earned $500,000 that year. But now being in that higher bracket could subject someone to new taxes on other income, like the 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on investment income, or a phaseout on the value of itemized deductions. Mr. Goodman pointed out that the hurdle rate for medical and miscellaneous deductions also goes up. In other words, reaching 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income for medical expenses is a lot harder at $500,000 than at $100,000. ""Depending on where your income levels are and how they creep up, those things start to come into play,"" Mr. Rosica said. ""Last year there weren't those add-ons that would catch you."" But since all of these conversions are a bet on the future, it is hard to know what next year or the year after might bring with taxes, and it will matter when the money comes out of these accounts."
6722,The 'Call Her Daddy' Feud: What Happened?,The podcast built a loyal audience. So did its hosts.,"Alexandra Cooper and Sofia Franklyn started the podcast, ""Call Her Daddy,"" in 2018.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/19/fashion/19CALL-HER-DADDY-cooper-franklyn/19CALL-HER-DADDY-cooper-franklyn-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=41c6932dfb3ba3d74f18f84e621be2fc9b0b7e6317d70ee0a36dfc6cf0fc9bf4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/style/call-her-daddy-podcast.html,cf0431ee-9bc8-54ca-b13d-98b77966b5f6.jpg,"In just two years, ""Call Her Daddy,"" a raunchy podcast about sex, dating, culture and life in New York, became a cult sensation. This week, it descended into a fireball of chaos and internet drama. Two friends, Sofia Franklyn, 27, and Alexandra Cooper, 26, started the show in 2018 after coming up with the idea over a vacation. The podcast was acquired by Barstool Sports about a month after the first episode aired and quickly began raking in hundreds of thousands of subscribers. It jumped from 12,000 to two million downloads in just two months and topped the podcast charts. It is one of the top 20 most popular on Apple Podcasts. ""They talk about things everyone can relate to, especially people in college and their 20s,"" said Addison Rose, 19, a college student and longtime fan. ""It's interesting to hear sex talked about in such an honest way from a women's perspective. It was refreshing.""

The last time anyone heard from the two ""Call Her Daddy"" hosts directly was on April 8, when they uploaded an episode with the cryptic subtitle ""Kesha... The End."" Then, the podcast's feed went dark. Fans began tweeting the hashtag #FreeTheFathers, speculating that the hosts were being silenced by their parent company, Barstool Sports. ""Fathers"" is an affectionate nickname given to the ""Call Her Daddy"" hosts. On April 21, Ms. Franklyn and Ms. Cooper posted a statement to Instagram saying that they ""legally can't speak out yet"" about what has been taking place behind the scenes. (Neither Ms. Cooper nor Ms. Franklyn responded to requests to comment for this article.) Tabloids speculated on a fallout between the two. Fans posted theories that they'd dropped hidden messages in the titles of recent episodes indicating trouble. On Sunday, the tension that had been quietly brewing for weeks boiled over. Dave Portnoy, the Barstool Sports founder and president, posted a 30-minute tell-all episode to the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast feed, calling Ms. Franklyn and Ms. Cooper ""unprofessional, disloyal and greedy"" before revealing the full details of his side of the messy contract dispute. According to Erika Nardini, the C.E.O. of Barstool, more than 35 percent of Barstool's revenue now comes from the company's podcast business, and ""Call Her Daddy"" was a crown jewel. Mr. Portnoy said the company was losing $100,000 per missed episode and said that he offered the hosts a guaranteed base salary of $500,000 a year, plus bonuses, among other incentives that he estimated would ultimately net them millions, to return to the show.

Now, the future of the show is uncertain. According to Mr. Portnoy, Ms. Cooper will likely return and take over ""Call Her Daddy,"" and an offer is out to Ms. Franklyn. They might host competing podcasts, both on the Barstool Network. On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Franklyn addressed the controversy on Instagram Stories. ""Did Barstool help blow up 'Call Her Daddy?' 100 percent,"" she said. But, that doesn't mean she'll be returning. ""I found out that Alex had gone behind my back and done something and I found out that it wasn't the first time. I'm willing to do 'Call Her Daddy,' I really am. I can't do it under the circumstances that she wants,"" Ms. Franklyn said. In the meantime, thousands of fans have continued weighing in online. Many have begged for a reconciliation. Others feel deeply betrayed.

Media companies have long acted as talent incubators, providing content producers name-brand recognition and access to a larger audience. But, as that talent builds a following on social media, the balance of power shifts. Often, talent no longer needs the media company to operate as a middleman, and many realize they could monetize their own platforms more effectively by themselves. ""Even though this feels messy and salacious, it actually does touch on much larger questions about media institutions and talent, and how they create value and contracts with each other,"" said Nicholas Quah, the founder of Hot Pod, a newsletter about podcasts. When ""Call Her Daddy"" started, Ms. Franklyn and Ms. Cooper were relatively unknown. Now they have about one million followers on Instagram each and wield a wide and loyal audience online. To Barstool Sports, however, they were simply employees.

This isn't the first time high-profile internet creators decided their media company wasn't working for them anymore and decided to forge out their own. In 2016, a slew of employees of BuzzFeed Video left to become full-time YouTubers. Scott Rogowsky went through extensive complex contract negotiations after HQ Trivia minted him as a star. And Tfue, an elite Fortnite player, sued FaZe Clan, a gaming content collective, in 2019, to escape what he considered an exploitive contract. ""The time is now for content creators, gamers and streamers to stop being taken advantage of through oppressive, unfair and illegal agreements,"" he wrote in the suit. While most traditional publishers and media brands would balk at litigating a contract dispute in public, Mr. Portnoy and Barstool Sports have proven themselves adept at leveraging online attention in their favor. ""A lot of companies would try to sweep this under the rug and put out a press release, but in this new world of media where these people are huge personalities, people expect transparency,"" Mr. Robbins said. ""This is a Barstool gold mine. They want these story lines. They can now create these competing podcasts between the 'Call Her Daddy' hosts, and I have no doubt that both would do really well.""

The systems for monetization are also increasingly complex. Most aspiring podcasters don't think of negotiating things like ownership of their back catalog, licensing agreements, platform exclusivity, intellectual property and more, upfront. ""The deal making is only becoming more complex,"" said Oren Rosenbaum, the head of emerging platforms at United Talent Agency. And, ""we're still on the ground floor. We're still in the infancy of this business."" No matter how the situation with ""Call Her Daddy"" resolves, these conflicts won't go away as long as the traditional media ecosystem remains in flux. But fans and those in the online creator industry are rapt. ""This is one of the first times in this new personality-driven media world that we've gotten insight into how the contracts are actually structured,"" Mr. Robbins said. ""Dave and Barstool clearly do bring something to the table, because they're making this one of the most talked-about things in pop culture."""

This season Penelope gets a viable love interest, the almost unbearably hunky Max (Ed Quinn), a veteran himself and an EMT. He towers over the rest of the cast, and the moment he's on screen opposite Lydia, it's impossible not to think ""I hope that giant man picks up Rita Moreno."" He does -- it takes a few episodes, but it is worth the wait.

Season 1 had a more urgent through-line about the teenage daughter Elena (Isabella Gomez) eventually coming out to her family in the lead-up to her quinceanera. This season doesn't have one central story, and that lack of a to-do list is a blessing and a curse: The show is looser and funnier than before, but it also sputters a little toward the end of the season, before an emotional finale that walks right up to but does not cross the corniness barrier.

But the trade-off is worth it, adding in room for stories about Lydia pursuing citizenship (""these colores don't run""), Penelope struggling with the demands of studying for a new certification, and Elena taking over fix-it duties for the building. Schneider (Todd Grinnell), the quintessential sitcom neighbor, is more grounded, and in one terrific scene talks with Penelope about her PTSD and his addiction crises. After a stretch of sobriety, he says, he relapsed. ""Woke up three days later in an alley. Then the bowling ball hit me."" The audience laughs for a beat. ""I was in the gutter for a long time."""

She was not able to be surrounded by her only living child, grandchildren or great-grandchildren. My mother survived four adolescent years with her parents, hiding from the Nazi plague in Polish forests. Five days before her death, she said to me, sadly, that she could not live this way. She felt that she was back in Poland, isolated, in hiding. The thought of being in hiding once again was simply unbearable. We were permitted only 10 people at her burial. Not even my entire immediate family was there to say the mourner's prayer at her grave. Now, I am an official mourner, following the traditions of my religion: sitting in my low chair, alone with my husband in our apartment, mirrors covered, my shirt ceremoniously rent, the mourning candle burning. No prayer services are being held in my home, and no family or friends are allowed to visit. It feels as if I have been mourning forever, and the last images of my mother's dying face are burnished forever in my mind's eye. The human isolation that tormented my mother's last days has descended upon me.

In rural France, where my parents live, death from Covid-19 has become very simple. My father was taken from us overnight -- from none of the usual virus symptoms to dying, all within 24 hours. My mother wasn't allowed to go with him to the hospital. She could only tell him she loved him and hug him for what would be the last time. And when he died, she wasn't allowed to go with him to the crematory. Bodies are taken by funeral directors for direct cremation or burial. The cemeteries are closed to mourners. My father's ashes now sit on a shelf in the funeral director's chapel, waiting. But this drastic simplicity has been a relief and a blessing. No decisions, no arrangements, no need for my sick mother to leave the safety of her house. For now, my mother video chats with family and reads us her many condolence cards. She plays my father's jazz records. Sometimes she feels him in the house, and it brings her great calm. My father would be glad. Plenty of time later to gather with friends and family to celebrate his life. Alan Phillips, Aug. 12, 1935 - March 22, 2020. I tested positive for H.I.V. when the test became available in 1985, four years after we heard of the first cases. During the 15 years that hundreds of thousands of people died in a steady stream, we each were coping with the loss of loved ones en masse while we saw others dying. We couldn't really properly grieve for an individual, because we were grieving for all those others gone and those going. There had never been a plague of that magnitude since the beginning of modern psychotherapy, and psychologists were figuring out how to help us cope. Mine called it ""collective grief syndrome,"" which meant that we were already overwhelmed by grieving for people we had lost that the death of someone new did not really get its proper due. We were numb. If you are losing more than one person at a time, stay strong, and give yourself permission to just let the waves of grief wash over you.

My friend Judy died a couple of weeks ago. One daughter was at her side when she died. No one else was allowed to visit. It wasn't Covid-19. Even during this pandemic, people still get sick and die for many reasons. Times aren't normal, but we still need to mourn. A scant handful of close family members was at her funeral, but her shiva, via Zoom, was attended by more than 100 people from all over the country. Judy's daughters shared pictures of their mother as a young woman. Friends, some of whom had known her for over 60 years, shared memories. Seeing those pictures and hearing those memories, I felt as if I was really getting to know Judy for the first time. Separated by miles, all of us talked together and prayed together and we were comforted. It was a beautiful experience. Judy would have approved. My brother German Luis was alone in his room in the house for the elderly he had lived in for the past four years when he passed away, on March 29. He was 70 and in a wheelchair, with diabetes, but otherwise -- or apparently -- in good health. He was found unresponsive. I was later informed that he had experienced cardiac arrest. This happened exactly two weeks after the stay-at-home curfew mandated on March 15 by the governor of Puerto Rico. I never saw his body. A week ago I was handed the urn containing his ashes while inside my car by a woman who came out to the parking lot. Mask on, respectfully trying to stay the farthest away from me. Everything else except that moment has been handled through emails and phone conversations. I miss the balm of hugs and embraces. I miss a roomful of family members crying with me. I have gotten plenty of loving phone calls, and text and Facebook messages. But no service is possible. Nobody knows when it will be. Coronavirus didn't take my brother away, but it planted itself, blunt and uninvited, in the space of grief that I need and my brother deserves."
60860,Texas School Board Set to Vote Textbook Revisions,"The conservative majority of the Texas School Board cast its eye on the teaching of American history, looking to emphasize the roles of capitalism, Christianity and G.O.P. political figures.","As the revisions to Texas textbooks on American history were debated on Wednesday, protesters gathered to oppose the changes.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/21/us/TEXTBOOKS-1/TEXTBOOKS-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=333&w=600&s=909bcc0804819cb73f4a547fd2d5a7f30ea8fea9f9f913ef46594fa88268a1f4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/education/21textbooks.html,00b098e1-1628-5d79-a0c7-5cec8fab4662.jpg,"AUSTIN, Tex. -- After facing months of protest, conservative members of the Texas Board of Education were expected Thursday night to vote to teach schoolchildren a version of American history that emphasizes the roles of capitalist enterprise, the military, Christianity and modern Republican political figures. The scheduled vote was a preliminary tally, with the final vote by the same group planned for Friday. The decision, expected to fall largely along the party lines -- the board has 10 Republicans and 5 Democrats -- followed tens of thousands of public comments, a protest rally and a daylong hearing where about 200 speakers addressed the board. By sheer force of its population size, Texas has long held outsize influence on national textbook publishers, some of whom sent curriculum writers to take notes in the boardroom.

That influence has waned somewhat in recent years, with the digital age allowing editors to tailor versions of their textbooks to individual states. But Texas has only increased in stature as a symbolic battleground over the politicization of education, largely because of the emergence of a conservative voting bloc on the board. Once a decade, the board members rewrite hundreds of pages of guidelines known as the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills, the blueprint for standardized tests used to judge teachers, principals and entire schools. Last year, conservatives on the board changed the state science curriculum to undermine the teaching of evolution, cell formation and the Big Bang. While many of the changes to the science curriculum used coded language to advance conservative principles, some additions to the history standards were more overtly political. Board members planned to add language requiring high school students of the civil rights movement to ""describe the role of individuals such as governors George Wallace, Orval Faubus, and Lester Maddox and groups, including the Congressional bloc of southern Democrats, that sought to maintain the status quo.""

In another passage, the board would require students to explain the roles of ""Phyllis Schlafly, the Contract With America, the Heritage Foundation, the Moral Majority, and the National Rifle Association."" By the time of the vote on Thursday, conservatives on the board had already outlined their intentions in broad strokes. Gary Bledsoe of the Texas N.A.A.C.P. was among the speakers at the protest rally, called ""Don't White-Out Our History."" In a hearing on Wednesday, dozens of speakers, including several professional educators hired to write the original standards, urged more time for review of the full curriculum. Instead, the board moved on to consider last-minute amendments. In a sign of the partisan rancor, color-coded books documenting the changes of recent months showed that many of the same words and phrases have been repeatedly inserted and removed. Some of those came up again on Thursday. The board's chairwoman, Gail Lowe, a Republican, tried to keep the panel's debate focused on the narrow scope of the new amendments. At one point, for example, Ms. Lowe silenced a question about the word ""justice,"" ruling it irrelevant to the matter at hand, which at the moment was whether first graders should learn the importance of ""respectfully"" holding public officials to account or just holding public officials to account."

But their diplomas will bear a different name: Stanford Online High School. Yes, that Stanford -- the elite research university known for producing graduates who win Nobels and found Googles, not for teaching basic algebra to teenagers. Five years after the opening of the experimental program, some education experts consider Stanford's decision to attach its name to the effort a milestone for online education. ""This is significant,"" said Bill Tucker, managing director of Education Sector, a nonpartisan policy institute. ""One of our country's most prestigious universities feels comfortable putting its considerable prestige and brand behind it."" As the line between virtual and classroom-based learning continues to blur, some see Stanford's move as a sign that so, too, will the line between secondary and higher education. Several other universities -- though none with the pedigree of Stanford -- already operate online high schools, a development that has raised some questions about expertise and motives.

""From my perspective, colleges, concentrate on what you're good at,"" said Ronald A. Crutcher, president of Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., who added that he had recently declined an offer from a for-profit education company to join other small liberal arts institutions in forming an online high school in their image. ""Be consultants, but don't contribute to a trend that I think has some real problems."" About 275,000 students nationwide are enrolled full time in online schools, according to Susan Patrick, president of the International Association for K-12 Online Learning, a nonprofit advocacy group. Most of these are free public charter schools, but colleges -- private and public -- have begun to get into the business as well. The University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and the University of Missouri have awarded diplomas to about 250 and 85 students, respectively, annually for the last several years. The George Washington University Online High School opened in January. Capitalizing on its reputation in foreign language instruction, Middlebury College in Vermont last year worked with K12, a for-profit company, to develop online high school language courses serving 50,000 students nationwide. An individual student's course costs $749 per year, and Middlebury will share the profits. Ronald Liebowitz, Middlebury's president, said that while ""it looks like mission creep beyond belief,"" the opportunity to raise revenue carried the decision. ""The risk is great, and I'd be silly if I said otherwise,"" Mr. Liebowitz said of lending Middlebury's name to a program whose teachers are not affiliated with the college. But, he noted, ""we could have millions of dollars coming into the operating budget, which eases the burden of other revenue streams -- mainly tuition and other fees. It's a for-profit venture.""

Ms. Patrick said the typical online high school student lives in a remote area, was previously home-schooled or is deeply involved in an extracurricular activity that is incompatible with traditional schooling. In this growing market, Stanford Online High School aims to be the destination for the most talented students. About 20 percent of the current 120 students receive financial aid to offset the $14,800 tuition, which is about half the average private-school tuition nationwide but far more than the University of Nebraska program's $2,500. About 300 more students take one or more $3,200-per-year classes to supplement a bricks-and-mortar program. Stanford officials said that the online high school had not yet yielded a profit, but that if it did, the money would be used for high school financial aid, not for the wider institution. There is no entrance exam, but a college-like application requires essays, letters of recommendation and standardized test scores. About 70 percent of the applicants were accepted this year, a far cry from Stanford University's 7.3 percent acceptance rate in 2010-11.

Of the high school's 75 graduates, 69 so far have enrolled directly in four-year colleges, according to Raymond Ravaglia, the high school's executive director. Eight attend Stanford, and 25 others are at Ivy League institutions or other elite campuses. ""I don't see this for a second competing with quality high schools, but for some people this could be an education they can't get,"" said John Etchemendy, Stanford's provost. ""I'm quite impressed with it, and they are clearly attracting capable students. It's something that does make me comfortable making Stanford's ownership of it more prominent.""

Mr. Ravaglia, a 1987 Stanford graduate, helped pioneer the university's online education programs in the 1990s. A few years after the 2001 opening of the university's summer program for high school students, he recommended a fusion of the two that could cater to Stanford-caliber high school students wanting an online option. The high school teachers are not university professors, though Mr. Ravaglia said a majority had doctorates. He declined to say how much they are paid. In a typical class session, about 14 students simultaneously watch a live-streamed lecture, with video clips, diagrams and other animations to enliven the lesson. Instead of raising hands, students click into a queue when they have questions or comments; teachers call on them by choosing their audio stream, to be heard by all. An instant-messaging window allows for constant discussion among the students who, in conventional settings, might be chastised for talking in class. ""You're interacting with people all the time -- with people all over the world,"" said Nick Benson, a senior whose career as an actor required the flexibility of online schooling. ""The nature of the classes is that you do interact with people quote-unquote in person -- you're seeing their face and responding to them like in any normal class."" Nick, who scored 2,340 out of 2,400 on the SAT and is applying to Stanford, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ivy League schools, said some college admissions officers needed some convincing. ""It's a conversation starter,"" he said. ""I haven't had an interview that doesn't run long, because they're curious what the school is about."" Students taking a full five-course load must be present for 10 seminars per week, each of them 60 to 90 minutes, with an additional 15 to 20 lectures of about 15 minutes that are recorded by the teachers and viewable at the students' convenience. Fridays are reserved for activities like a student newspaper and an engineering team. Papers are submitted electronically, and students are required to find a Stanford-approved proctor to oversee exams. ""It's uncommon for an online high school to not rely on more of an honor system, and it is a pain for kids to find suitable proctors,"" Mr. Ravaglia said. ""But we want legitimacy in the results, and don't want students coming to the school for the wrong reason."""

The U.S. Navy and the Marines have banned public displays of the Confederate battle flag -- as has NASCAR.

Now, Congress is taking its own halting steps forward. On Thursday, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced that portraits of four former House speakers who also served the Confederacy would be removed from display in the Capitol in observance of the Juneteenth holiday. (June 19 marks the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news of the end of slavery -- two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation. It has come to be a more general celebration of liberation.)

The portraits are of Robert M.T. Hunter of Virginia, who was speaker from 1839 to 1841 before serving in various high positions in the Confederacy, including secretary of state; Howell Cobb of Georgia, who was speaker from 1849 to 1851 and later served as a Confederate Army officer; James L. Orr of South Carolina, speaker from 1857 to 1859, who went on to serve in the Confederate Army and in the Confederate Senate; and Charles F. Crisp of Georgia, the House speaker from 1891 to 1895, who served in the Confederate Army as a young man.

""As I have said before, the halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy,"" Ms. Pelosi wrote to the clerk of the House, requesting the removal. ""There is no room in the hallowed halls of Congress or in any place of honor for memorializing men who embody the violent bigotry and grotesque racism of the Confederacy."""

Although Comcast's interest in 21st Century Fox was previously known, details of Comcast's proposal -- and Fox's reasoning for rebuffing it -- were disclosed for the first time on Wednesday as part of a 456-page filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The paperwork, required under securities law, also disclosed that senior Fox executives, including Mr. Murdoch and his two sons, James and Lachlan, are eligible for tens of millions of dollars in ""golden parachute"" payments.

Disney's all-stock deal with 21st Century Fox, announced on Dec. 14, valued Mr. Murdoch's company at $29.54 a share. Among other assets, Disney bought the 20th Century Fox studio, Hulu, the FX cable network, and stakes in two overseas television-service providers, Sky of Britain and Star of India. Disney did not buy Fox News or the Fox broadcast network.

Comcast, identified in the filing as Party B, made an all-stock proposal worth $34.41 per share in November. The filing portrays Mr. Murdoch and the Fox board as taking Comcast's interest seriously -- until Comcast repeatedly refused to agree to a breakup fee in case Department of Justice regulators rejected the deal. Disney, perhaps showing more confidence in its chances with regulators, had offered a $2.5 billion fee."
10161,The Many Symptoms of Covid-19,"From a sniffle or cough that feels like allergies to severe body aches and crippling fatigue, the symptoms of coronavirus can be unpredictable from head to toe.",A temperature check outside a store in Brooklyn.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/11/science/05WELL-COVIDSYMPTOMS3/merlin_173813931_b87dc1ca-a27d-476a-9528-7b813b9a5438-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=554871ddc793732f8fa323f4aaa94d92b5fea60f193817ce30fc6965656df8aa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/well/live/coronavirus-covid-symptoms.html,ab696a60-4a1e-5c60-97ee-4168f8e6202d.jpg,"For a Texas nurse, the first sign that something was wrong happened while brushing her teeth -- she couldn't taste her toothpaste. For a Georgia attorney, it was hitting a wall of fatigue on a normally easy run. When a Wisconsin professor fell ill in June, he thought a bad meal had upset his stomach. But eventually, all of these people discovered that their manifold symptoms were all signs of Covid-19. Some of the common symptoms -- a dry cough, a headache -- can start so mildly they are at first mistaken for allergies or a cold. In other cases, the symptoms are so unusual -- strange leg pain, a rash or dizziness -- that patients and even their doctors don't think Covid-19 could be the culprit. With more than 18 million cases of coronavirus worldwide, one thing is clear: The symptoms are varied and strange, they can be mild or debilitating, and the disease can progress, from head to toe, in unpredictable ways.

""The problem is that it depends on who you are and how healthy you are,"" said Dr. Mark A. Perazella, a kidney specialist and professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. ""It's so heterogeneous, it's hard to say. If you're healthy, most likely you'll get fever, achiness, nasal symptoms, dry cough and you'll feel crappy. But there are going to be the oddballs that are challenging and come in with some symptoms and nothing else, and you don't suspect Covid."" [Sign up for the Well newsletter.] The Texas nurse who couldn't taste her toothpaste said she developed fever, ""horrible"" body aches and coughing the next day. Her symptoms lasted for five days. (She and many others interviewed asked that their names not be used to protect their medical privacy or to protect their families from the stigma of Covid-19.) Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell that is also often accompanied by a loss of taste, is viewed as a defining symptom. In a study of 961 health care workers who were tested for Covid-19, anosmia was the most predictive symptom, but it wasn't foolproof. Only half the people who reported losing their sense of smell or taste tested positive, said Dr. Brian Clemency, the study's lead author and an associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo. Even a symptom as common as fever can be tricky when trying to predict if a patient might have Covid-19. Although many businesses are doing fever checks to screen for Covid-19, many Covid-19 patients never have a fever. In a European study of 2,000 Covid-19 patients with mild to moderate illness, 60 percent never had a fever. In the University at Buffalo study, fewer than one in three patients with fever also tested positive for Covid-19.

Rob Gregson, 52, of South Orange, N.J., went to bed feeling under the weather and woke up with chest tightness, a ""weird"" cough, difficulty breathing and ""crazy fatigue."" It was March 11, just before lockdowns were imposed, and he immediately suspected Covid-19. But because he never had a fever, it took him more than a week to find a doctor to help and get a swab test. He tested positive. ""It's been the fatigue that is the most debilitating,"" said Mr. Gregson, executive director of a faith-based nonprofit, adding that he's still struggling to regain his stamina nearly five months later. ""I've been on the coronavirus roller coaster, feeling better and thinking I'll be OK, then it comes roaring back."" When Erin, a 30-year-old who works for a nonprofit in Washington, D.C., first developed a cough and headache in May, she wasn't worried. ""I did not have a fever, and I'd been very diligent about wearing a mask and washing my hands, so I figured it was allergies or a cold at the beginning,"" she said. About four days after the cough began, Erin was hit with severe fatigue, sore throat, congestion, chills, body aches and a slight loss of sense of smell -- but still no fever. She also had one unusual symptom: severe pain in her hip muscles, which she described as ""really weird."" Although body aches are a common symptom of Covid-19, some patients are reporting severe joint and body pain, particularly in large muscles. Although it's rare, Covid-19 can cause painful inflammation in the joints or lead to rhabdomyolysis, a serious and potentially life-threatening illness that can cause excruciating muscle pain in the shoulders, thighs or lower back. A New York cyclist who developed severe leg pain in May was initially diagnosed via telemedicine with a bulging disc. She sought a second telemedicine opinion with Dr. Jordan Metzl, a sports medicine specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, who asked her to move, twist and put pressure on her legs as he watched her on video.

""Down to her calf she said, 'Ouch, that really hurts,'"" said Dr. Metzl, who grew worried. ""I'm not an alarmist doctor in the least, but I looked for the closest emergency room to her, which was 16 miles away. I said, 'I want you to get in the car and drive yourself to the E.R. right now.'"" An ultrasound showed she had no pulse in her legs and severe clotting in both legs, putting her at risk of amputation. She was transferred to another hospital and underwent nine hours of emergency surgery. Dr. Metzl said it was fortunate that he had just had a conference call with colleagues about blood clots and Covid. ""It's a terrifying story, which is why we need awareness around these weird presentations,"" Dr. Metzl said. ""Covid infection can affect different body parts differently. Some people get this hypercoagulable state and end up getting blood clots. We don't always know who those people are."" In June, John, a 55-year-old professor in Oshkosh, Wis., woke up one morning feeling like something he had eaten disagreed with him. The next day he was hit with debilitating fatigue and nausea, cramping and other gastrointestinal symptoms. He didn't suspect Covid-19 because he had been wearing a mask and social distancing. ""By the second day I was just wanting to sleep all the time. I was probably sleeping 20 hours a day,"" he said. ""I even remember during that time my mind set changed. I could not imagine how my wife and son were able to be awake all day. I thought, 'How can anyone possibly do that?' I would get out of bed and go to the kitchen for a glass of water, and by the time I got there all I could think about was wanting to go back to bed."" Doctors tested him for Covid-19 and Lyme disease. Both were negative. An ultrasound showed no problems, but blood work suggested he had an infection of some kind. A doctor prescribed a two-week course of a heartburn drug, and he lost 10 pounds. After two weeks, he began feeling better. Two months later, he tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, suggesting his original Covid test had been a false negative. Doctors say Covid patients with only gastrointestinal symptoms often test negative when tested with a nasal-pharyngeal swab. The virus might be more likely to show up in fecal testing, which is common in other countries, but not widely used in the United States. The gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract both are rich in a receptor called ACE2, which the virus uses to get into our cells. But it's unclear why the virus sometimes seems to skip the respiratory tract and instead infects only the digestive tract.

""This is a very tricky and confounding virus and disease, and we are finding out surprising things about it every day,"" said Dr. Asaf Bitton, executive director of Ariadne Labs at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor of infectious diseases at the University of Alberta, said he was tested for Covid-19 after developing respiratory symptoms. The test came back negative, but then he developed Covid toes -- painful red or purple lesions on the tips of fingers and toes that are believed to be a telltale symptom of coronavirus, particularly in younger patients. It may happen as a result of small blood clots or when the virus invades blood vessels. ""I started getting these sores on my feet and couldn't figure out what was going on,"" said Dr. Schwartz, who is 37. ""They were really painful. I thought maybe I had stubbed them -- like all of them, which would be unusual. Then I thought maybe there's something wrong with my shoes. I've heard a lot of people with similar stories end up buying new shoes because they don't know what's going on. It's such an unusual symptom that it's not natural to think of a respiratory virus being responsible for sore toes."" Thomas Ryan, 36, an Atlanta attorney, said the first sign that something was wrong hit him during exercise. ""I went for a run on a Thursday afternoon after work and felt awful,"" he said. ""I hit the wall like you do in a marathon on a very short run for me."" The next morning, he woke up with a light cough, sore throat and a feeling in his chest like heartburn, and later developed fatigue, lung pain and shortness of breath. Although his Covid test was negative, his doctor told him that it was a false negative, and that based on his symptoms, he clearly had Covid-19. ""This is not great,"" said Mr. Ryan, who was still coughing weeks after falling ill. ""The amount of energy I have -- I feel like I'm at altitude. It was two weeks of not being able to do anything. If this is a mild case, it makes me think people are taking a lot of risks they probably shouldn't be."""
15896,The Coronavirus Is Mutating. What Does That Mean for Us?,"Officials in Britain and South Africa claim new variants are more easily transmitted. There's a lot more to the story, scientists say.",A woman walks on a rain-soaked Oxford Street on the first day of Tier 3 restrictions in London. The city has been moved to even tighter restrictions.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/20/multimedia/20virus-escape/20virus-escape-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/health/coronavirus-britain-variant.html,58abb268-9343-5b6f-90fb-a807c54db4df.jpg,"The Coronavirus Is Mutating. What Does That Mean for Us?

Just as vaccines begin to offer hope for a path out of the pandemic, officials in Britain this past weekend sounded an urgent alarm about what they called a highly contagious new variant of the coronavirus circulating in England. Citing the rapid spread of the virus through London and surrounding areas, Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed the country's most stringent lockdown since March. ""When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defense,"" he said. Train stations in London filled with crowds of people scrambling to leave the city as the restrictions went into effect. On Sunday, European countries began closing their borders to travelers from the United Kingdom, hoping to shut out the new iteration of the pathogen. In South Africa, a similar version of the virus has emerged, sharing one of the mutations seen in the British variant, according to scientists who detected it. That virus has been found in up to 90 percent of the samples whose genetic sequences have been analyzed in South Africa since mid-November.

Scientists are worried about these variants but not surprised by them. Researchers have recorded thousands of tiny modifications in the genetic material of the coronavirus as it has hopscotched across the world. Some variants become more common in a population simply by luck, not because the changes somehow supercharge the virus. But as it becomes more difficult for the pathogen to survive -- because of vaccinations and growing immunity in human populations -- researchers also expect the virus to gain useful mutations enabling it to spread more easily or to escape detection by the immune system. ""It's a real warning that we need to pay closer attention,"" said Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. ""Certainly these mutations are going to spread, and, definitely, the scientific community -- we need to monitor these mutations and we need to characterize which ones have effects."" The British variant has about 20 mutations, including several that affect how the virus locks onto human cells and infects them. These mutations may allow the variant to replicate and transmit more efficiently, said Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and a scientific adviser to the British government. But the estimate of greater transmissibility -- British officials said the variant was as much as 70 percent more transmissible -- is based on modeling and has not been confirmed in lab experiments, Dr. Cevik added.

""Over all, I think we need to have a little bit more experimental data,"" she said. ""We can't entirely rule out the fact that some of this transmissibility data might be related to human behavior."" Read More on the Coronavirus Pandemic

* None Personality Changes: New research suggests that Covid's disruption of social rituals and rites of passage have made people New research suggests that Covid's disruption of social rituals and rites of passage have made people less extroverted, creative, agreeable and conscientious In South Africa, too, scientists were quick to note that human behavior was driving the epidemic, not necessarily new mutations whose effect on transmissibility had yet to be quantified. The British announcement also prompted concern that the virus might evolve to become resistant to the vaccines just now rolling out. The worries are focused on a pair of alterations in the viral genetic code that may make it less vulnerable to certain antibodies. But several experts urged caution, saying it would take years -- not months -- for the virus to evolve enough to render the current vaccines impotent. ""No one should worry that there is going to be a single catastrophic mutation that suddenly renders all immunity and antibodies useless,"" Dr. Bloom said. ""It is going to be a process that occurs over the time scale of multiple years and requires the accumulation of multiple viral mutations,"" he added. ""It's not going to be like an on-off switch."" The scientific nuance mattered little to Britain's neighbors. Worried by the potential influx of travelers carrying the variant, the Netherlands said it would suspend flights from Britain from Sunday until Jan. 1.

Italy also suspended air travel, and Belgian officials on Sunday enacted a 24-hour ban on arrivals from the United Kingdom by air or train. Germany is drawing up regulations limiting travelers from Britain as well as from South Africa. Other countries are also considering bans, among them France, Austria and Ireland, according to local media. Spain has asked the European Union for a coordinated response to banning flights. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York asked the Trump administration to consider banning flights from Britain. In England, transport officials said that they would increase the number of police officers monitoring hubs like railway stations to ensure only essential journeys were being taken. The country's health secretary, Matt Hancock, on Sunday called those who were packing trains ""clearly irresponsible."" He also said that the restrictions Mr. Johnson imposed could be in place for months. Like all viruses, the coronavirus is a shape-shifter. Some genetic changes are inconsequential, but some may give it an edge. Scientists fear the latter possibility, especially: The vaccination of millions of people may force the virus to new adaptations, mutations that help it evade or resist the immune response. Already, there are small changes in the virus that have arisen independently multiple times across the world, suggesting these mutations are helpful to the pathogen. The mutation affecting antibody susceptibility -- technically called the 69-70 deletion, meaning there are missing letters in the genetic code -- has been seen at least three times: in Danish minks, in people in Britain and in an immune-suppressed patient who became much less sensitive to convalescent plasma. ""This thing's transmitting, it's acquiring, it's adapting all the time,"" said Dr. Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge, who last week detailed the deletion's recurrent emergence and spread. ""But people don't want to hear what we say, which is: This virus will mutate.""

The new genetic deletion changes the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus, which it needs to infect human cells. Variants of the virus with this deletion arose independently in Thailand and Germany in early 2020, and became prevalent in Denmark and England in August. Scientists initially thought the new coronavirus was stable and unlikely to escape vaccine-induced immune response, said Dr. Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London. ""But it's become very clear over the last several months that mutations can occur,"" she said. ""As selection pressure increases with mass vaccination, I think these mutants will become more common."" Several recent papers have shown that the coronavirus can evolve to avoid recognition by a single monoclonal antibody, a cocktail of two antibodies or even convalescent serum given to a specific individual. Fortunately, the body's entire immune system is a much more formidable adversary. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines induce an immune response only to the spike protein carried by the coronavirus on its surface. But each infected person produces a large, unique and complex repertoire of antibodies to this protein. ""The fact is that you have a thousand big guns pointed at the virus,"" said Kartik Chandran, a virologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. ""No matter how the virus twists and weaves, it's not that easy to find a genetic solution that can really combat all these different antibody specificities, not to mention the other arms of the immune response."" In short: It will be very hard for the coronavirus to escape the body's defenses, despite the many variations it may adopt.

Escape from immunity requires that a virus accumulate a series of mutations, each allowing the pathogen to erode the effectiveness of the body's defenses. Some viruses, like influenza, amass those changes relatively quickly. But others, like the measles virus, collect hardly any of the alterations. Even the influenza virus needs five to seven years to collect enough mutations to escape immune recognition entirely, Dr. Bloom noted. His lab on Friday published a new report showing that common cold coronaviruses also evolve to escape immune detection -- but over many years. The scale of the infections in this pandemic may be quickly generating diversity in the new coronavirus. Still, a vast majority of people worldwide have yet to be infected, and that has made scientists hopeful. ""It would be a little surprising to me if we were seeing active selection for immune escape,"" said Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland. ""In a population that's still mostly naive, the virus just doesn't need to do that yet,"" she said. ""But it's something we want to watch out for in the long term, especially as we start getting more people vaccinated."" Immunizing about 60 percent of a population within about a year, and keeping the number of cases down while that happens, will help minimize the chances of the virus mutating significantly, Dr. Hodcroft said. Still, scientists will need to closely track the evolving virus to spot mutations that may give it an edge over vaccines.

Scientists routinely monitor mutations in flu viruses in order to update vaccines, and should do the same for the coronavirus, said Trevor Bedford, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. ""You can imagine a process like exists for the flu vaccine, where you're swapping in these variants and everyone's getting their yearly Covid shot,"" he said. ""I think that's what generally will be necessary."" The good news is that the technology used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is much easier to adjust and update than conventional vaccines. The new vaccines also generate a massive immune response, so the coronavirus may need many mutations over years before the vaccines must be tweaked, Dr. Bedford said. In the meantime, he and other experts said, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other government agencies should set up a national system to link viral sequence databases with on-the-ground data -- like whether an infection occurred despite vaccination. ""These are useful pokes for scientists and governments to get systems in place -- now, before we might need them, especially as we start vaccinating people,"" Dr. Hodcroft said. ""But the public should not necessarily be panicking."" Isabella Kwai contributed reporting from London, and Matina Stevis-Gridneff from Brussels. Sheri Fink contributed reporting from South Africa."

From 6,500 miles away, Andres Iniesta has been contemplating his return. He doesn't know when it will be, or under what circumstances, but he is sure he wants to go back to F.C. Barcelona. The club he hopes to rejoin will not be the same. Something has changed. It's not about the coronavirus, which, it is true, has changed everything, including La Liga, which was suspended indefinitely in mid-March. The team was still a winner, but in a different way. Victories were being ground out, the soccer no longer felt otherworldly, the players on the field looking like what they are: talented men plucked from around the globe to forge a winning team. That team is leading the championship race again, but its superiority belies a turbulent, graceless campaign that featured five defeats before the coronavirus brought the season to a halt. Off the field, things are even worse, with the soccer stoppage bringing renewed focus on boardroom plotting and rancor. In a far foreign land, Iniesta, who is seeing out the end of his career in Japan with Vissel Kobe, has kept up with the ugliness and the sense of crisis that has seized a club that not so long ago was admired across sports.

A growing rift between management and the players has played out in public -- with the superstar forward Lionel Messi -- not known, until this season at least, for bellicose public outbursts -- taking the leadership to task. And then, last month, six board members resigned, calling for the ouster of the current president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, amid accusations of mismanagement, while its vice president, Emili Rousaud, among the officials to leave, has made corruption accusations. That followed claims that the club had hired a public relations company to smear opponents of Bartomeu on social media, and even to criticize some of its own players, including Messi.



The bitterness is all the more striking given the way the club has forged an image of being something different, an institution that is a living monument to higher ideals, one that revolves around its ""mes que un club"" or ""more than a club"" motto.

Letting out a loud sigh, Iniesta, who turned 36 on Monday, said the prolonged infighting was threatening to diminish the team's reputation and hurt the team on the field. ""It makes me mad when the things that are spoken about are not purely football,"" he said in a recent interview from the Japanese apartment he shares with his wife and four children. ""Of course, it bothers me that people talk about matters that are not football because it's harmful. Normally, when matters come up that aren't football, those situations don't often end well.""

Barcelona has denied the accusations against it as ""grave and unfounded"" and denied ""any action that could be described as corruption."" Rafa Cabeleira, a columnist for El Pais, a Spanish daily, who writes regularly on Barcelona, said the philosophy of the team's being more than a club -- an idea dating to a time when the club stood as a bulwark of resistance against the Spanish dictatorship -- had largely been reduced to a commercial slogan as boardroom machinations have become increasingly opaque. According to its constitution, the club must hold elections to replace Bartomeu by June 2021. His opponents, including Rousaud, the ousted vice president, want them to take place sooner than that, believing it is urgent that the club be overhauled. While Iniesta did not state a preference, he hinted for a change to be made sooner rather than later. ""Undoubtedly, situations that take place off the pitch can harm the club,"" he said. Messi, in his role as club captain, called out the club twice this season: first, after the team's sporting director appeared to blame players for Coach Ernesto Valverde's dismissal, and then for what he perceived as attempts to sully the players' reputations during discussions on wage cuts after the virus led to the suspension of play. The uncertainty around the club has led to speculation about the return of former players to leadership positions. There was a doomed effort to bring back Iniesta's longtime midfield partner, Xavi Hernandez, to replace Valverde as coach in January. In the end, the team was forced to turn to Quique Setien, who expressed astonishment at being handed the reins. An effort last year to hire the former captain Carles Puyol as sporting director also failed. Last year, Xavi gave his backing to Victor Font, a prospective candidate for the presidency, who has been critical of how Bartomeu has run the club.

While Iniesta remains unsure of exactly how and under what circumstances he and his former teammates will be back at the club, it seems inconceivable to him that the story arc that turned some hopeful children into linchpins for one of history's best soccer teams will not include a final, postcareer chapter with them working together again, and perhaps rescuing Barcelona from its current mess. Iniesta quickly name-checked a half-dozen former teammates before saying it would be ""very hard to imagine yourself separated"" from the club. ""It remains to be seen the capacity that each one of us has to return or not, and in what capacity,"" he said. ""We'll see about that. I would love to return to Barca.""



For those who follow the club closely, it appears inevitable that several former stars will return eventually. For instance, Cabeleira, the columnist, is convinced that Gerard Pique, who remains the cornerstone of the team's defense, will be a candidate for Barcelona's presidency and that Xavi and Puyol are likely to return, too -- Xavi as a coach and Puyol as his sporting director. As for Iniesta, his return can only be possible once he extinguishes his desire to keep playing, to keep dazzling crowds with his dancer-like movements and his Velcro-like control of the ball.

For now, and with the benefit of time and distance, the midfielder is able to reflect on the glory-filled years back at Camp Nou in a way he had never been able to. He has come to the realization that the way he and a team made up mostly of pals from the club's academy conquered the soccer world was an aberration, a combination of luck and design that is unlikely to be repeated. ""With the passage of time, you realize that,"" Iniesta said. Iniesta, who moved to La Masia, the team's fabled youth academy, as a teary-eyed child from Albacete, lights up when he speaks of those years playing with the likes of Sergio Busquets, Xavi, Pique and, of course, Messi. It would not be much of a stretch to say that group, guided by Coach Pep Guardiola, who joined the same youth system as a starry-eyed hopeful a generation earlier, changed soccer, winning with a style that was pleasing to the eye. By the time Iniesta left, he had collected nine league titles and four Champions League winner's medals. (He also scored Spain's winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final.) ""The thing that most stands out for me is that I've understood just how difficult it is to win, how hard it is to win La Liga, to win the Champions League, of how hard it is to win a World Cup or the European Cup,"" Iniesta said. ""That's what's of real value. When you're in the midst of a competition, when you're in the day-to-day, you don't have time to appreciate it, or if you've won a lot, it seems normal."" Normality, for now, is in short supply at Camp Nou."
19198,Using Fiction to Show How Self-Control Becomes Self-Destructive,"In their debut novels, Yara Zgheib and Anissa Gray explore the harrowing experience of female eating disorders.",Yara Zgheib,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/24/books/review/00Weisberg-1-1/00Weisberg-1-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f67cb96e7e80bda083b33398cdd89ccb9d198e9930afae64ddeb421ce7c0e7f0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/books/review/care-feeding-ravenously-hungry-girls-anissa-gray-girls-17-swann-street-yara-zgheib.html,8d5f5a80-c447-5296-aec2-89c05640bf3c.jpg,"THE CARE AND FEEDING OF RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY GIRLS 

By Anissa Gray No one seems to diet anymore. People may go on a ""cleanse"" or attempt to ""eat clean,"" but their goal is grander than mere weight loss -- they're seeking a vague sense of equanimity that's become known as ""wellness."" The modern woman aspires to be ""strong"" and ""healthy""; she does not care (or not explicitly) about fitting into a smaller dress size. ""Self-care"" is trendy, while self-denial is not, even if both require skipping dessert. This new, reverent language around dieting offers innumerable euphemisms for eating disorders. When Anna, the main character of 's debut, ""The Girls at 17 Swann Street,"" arrives at the clinic that gives the novel its title, she informs a concerned therapist that she is vegan. ""I also avoid processed foods, refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup and trans fats,"" she says with pride. The 26-year-old Parisian, a former dancer, sees herself as health-conscious, when really she is starving. At intake, she is 88 pounds. The first of a series of medical reports, printed throughout the novel to mark Anna's progress, states that she suffers from a dozen different conditions including ""malnutrition -- severe."" This early exchange between Anna and her therapist is one of just a few moments in the book that reference contemporary buzzwords, that feel current (another counselor discourages the use of ""triggering"" language). Eating disorders are often considered a contagion of popular culture, but the residents of 17 Swann Street don't have the energy to watch films or discuss internet memes. Recovery is all-encompassing. The clinic is in Missouri, but it could be anywhere. Anna and the others live in their own private time zone. They eat six times a day. If they watch television, it's reruns of the Olympics from years earlier.

What distinguishes Anna from the other gauzy young women at the clinic is that she maintains a daily tether to the outside -- her husband, Matthias, who visits every night, between dinner and evening snack. Though the novel's present tracks Anna's time in treatment, there are frequent flashbacks to her blissful former life with Matthias in Paris, vignettes in which food often plays a central role. On an early date, Anna trades her uneaten olives for his discarded pizza crusts. Later on, they are too settled in their happiness to address her anorexia, even when she becomes so weak that she can't enjoy roller coasters, beach trips or sex. The chapters set in Swann Street are written in the first person, in tight, understated prose that conjures Anna's utter exhaustion. ""I do not laugh very often anymore. Very little is funny. When I do, it sounds different,"" Anna thinks. The passages about her life with Matthias are written in the third person, in lush, descriptive sentences. But the true love story of this novel is not between Anna and Matthias, but between Anna and the other residents. ""Anorexia is the same story told every time by a different girl. Her name does not matter,"" Anna reflects. This shared diagnosis leads to a fierce solidarity among the residents. When one girl strains to finish her meal, the others distract her with horoscopes, word games and quiet kindnesses. ""No girl left at the table alone"" is their golden rule. They are too ill to find relief in the ""body positivity"" movement happening outside and online; the only people who can understand their overwhelming fear of fatness are one another. Anna's illness may not be unique, but her story is a singular celebration of the lifesaving power of community and small gestures. Eating disorders are associated with the young, white and privileged -- the kind of women who tend to be in treatment at Swann Street. But Anissa Gray's debut novel, ""The Care and Feeding of Ravenously Hungry Girls,"" complicates this stereotype. One of the novel's narrators, Viola Butler, is a 40-something black woman with an eating disorder. She is by no means a girl -- she's a successful therapist who drives a Lexus -- but, like the residents at Swann Street, she is addicted to a regimen of excessive exercise and calorie counting. Control, or the illusion of it, is her drug of choice.

It's a fast-paced, intriguing story, but the novel's real achievement is its uncommon perceptiveness on the origins and variations of addiction. The three Butler sisters, who take turns narrating the story, each have their own preferred method of self-sabotage. Althea steals, Lillian is unfaithful to her husband, Viola struggles with bulimia. In a particularly excruciating scene, she checks into a highway motel with a load of junk food and proceeds to eat, then purge, it all. Afterward, she feels a blitz of relief: ""Xanax couldn't make me feel any mellower."" As soon as the calm recedes, she reaches for a fresh pack of Oreos. Gray's novel unfolds like a mystery, with each chapter revealing new information about how the Butler sisters found themselves in this situation. This is not a whodunit: Althea is unambiguously guilty. The mystery is why she did it, or why Lillian cheats, or Viola binges. Details emerge about their traumatic childhoods that help to explain their perennial discontent, what Viola describes as ""the thing in you that cries out, endlessly, More, please."" By the end of the novel, this ravenous hunger has been satiated, at least somewhat, by the sisters' renewed affection for one another, something they had each been craving for a long time."
26329,Michael Kiwanuka Felt 'One Step Away.' Now He Has a Seat at the Table.,"The London-born son of Ugandan immigrants on alienation, getting married and his self-assured new album, ""Kiwanuka.""","Michael Kiwanuka's new album, ""Kiwanuka,"" is a declaration of self-worth from an artist who has been open about his insecurities.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/arts/29Kiwanuka2/29Kiwanuka2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=99eb77e295f4b67f30d4a6bc88e7642e6539ec39aba68c2ec3bcd27e8c4ab337&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/arts/music/michael-kiwanuka.html,fb1a542a-01a4-5a93-ba39-93beb78ef30e.jpg,"Around the summer of 2016, shortly after his second album, ""Love & Hate,"" was released, Michael Kiwanuka started getting texts from Russell Crowe. The texts were friendly -- compliments about his music, invitations to get a beer, enthusiastic updates about works in progress -- but felt strangely portentous, like being invited behind a velvet rope. After all, Crowe, the Academy Award-winning star of ""Gladiator,"" was seeking out and befriending Kiwanuka, an acclaimed but relatively obscure singer-songwriter who still felt grateful for more than a few hundred likes on Instagram. Kiwanuka felt the strangeness most intensely when he went to one of Crowe's dinner parties. He hadn't known it was a dinner party. He just thought Crowe was inviting him to hang out. But there he was, at a dining table in Crowe's expensive London hotel suite, as a parade of Britain's tabloid elite walked in and sat next to him: David Beckham, Tom Jones, Ed Sheeran. He could feel the eyes in the room bearing down on him, all of which seemed to be asking the same question: Who in the hell is that? Kiwanuka's third album, called ""Kiwanuka"" and out Friday, is a hard-won answer to that question. It's a muscular, multilayered declaration of self-worth and reliance from an artist who has been open about his insecurities, both as a ""Black Man in a White World,"" as he put it in a trenchant 2016 song, and as a rock and soul singer who was born into the wrong decade.

His first album, ""Home Again"" (2012), impressed critics with its observant, soul-flecked folk songs, delivered in a rich, full-bodied voice that sounded the way drinking hot cocoa in front of a crackling fireplace feels. But it was ""Love & Hate"" -- an eclectic reanimation of psych rock, political R&B and funk, which, among other distinctions, spawned the unlikely theme song for ""Big Little Lies"" -- that first showed the artist growing into his talents, and earned him a seat at that table with Beckham and Sheeran. (Kiwanuka, an introvert, said he only lasted at the party for about two hours.) He re-teamed with the producers of ""Love & Hate,"" Danger Mouse and Inflo, to make ""Kiwanuka,"" on which questions of ego, identity and belonging receive top billing. ""If you don't belong, live in the trouble,"" he sings on the upbeat first single, ""You Ain't the Problem,"" putting a finger on what could be the album's thesis statement. Earlier this fall, Kiwanuka, 32 , sat at a sidewalk cafe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn -- wearing his signature unkempt Afro and high-top Chuck Taylors -- and discussed feeling perpetually ""one step away"" from social acceptance as a child, the effect getting married had on his songwriting and the prognosis for rock 'n' roll in the 21st century. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. ""You Ain't the Problem"" is a kind of pep talk for people who might feel rejected, or fear rejection. Was that something that you needed to hear?

It was a little, yeah. I was thinking about being an artist and, specifically, how I used to get really self-conscious at festivals. I would see my favorite artists, or people who I thought were really cool and had these things that I aspired to have, and I'd be like ""Man, I don't know how to do that""; or ""My songs are like this, but if only they were like that."" I just got really tired of that negative, beat-yourself-up mentality. I started to think, ""Screw this, man: There's nothing wrong with me. Of course I can work on myself and grow, but enough of this self-deprecating attitude. Let me just enjoy this amazing experience of being an artist, and believe in myself, and keep going."" ""Hero,"" the second single, is almost the flip side of that. It's ""I'm everything you ever wanted. Now what?"" I was thinking about what it takes to become a big name, like a full-blown superstar. A lot of the times it's inventing this image, or an alter ego, like Elton John or Bob Dylan or David Bowie. I really hated that idea, because I've taken so long just to be really happy with myself -- the last thing I want to do is try to make up this new character. So ""Hero"" is kind of posing that question: If I do all of these things, will I become this iconic big singer?

Alienation and self-worth are recurring themes in your music. Is that the legacy of your childhood in London? Yeah. My family and I stuck out so much in the town we were in. It was mostly white people. I was lucky because I had a fun upbringing, but I never quite slotted in anywhere perfectly. I would listen to rock music and indie, but I could never dress like those kids did -- I couldn't even figure out where to get the clothes from. And even when we would go to Uganda, they would call me and my brother ""mzungu,"" which can mean either English or white man. So everywhere I went I was always just one step away from being the thing that everyone else was. It wasn't until I started playing in bands and making my own music in secondary school that I felt like I found a place where I really belonged.

Since ""Love & Hate,"" you've gotten married and entered your 30s. Has it changed you? It has; I think it really helped improve my confidence. All that stuff about comparing myself to other artists, or feeling insecure in the studio, it really started to die down after I got married. I'm enjoying the skin I'm in a bit more. There's just a peace in feeling like ""This is my team."" It's made me care more about other people. It's funny, because I love melancholy stuff so much. But now I do want to sing about more joyful things, instead of just ""Cold Little Heart."" There's a song on this album called ""Piano Joint"" that originally had a different theme and chorus. It used to be ""My oh my, it's sad in love."" Danger Mouse and I liked it a lot, and it rhymed perfectly. But I just couldn't sing it -- it was too negative. When I went to record it for the album, I told the engineer that I had to change the lyrics. So now it's ""My oh my, this kind of love,"" and it's about how even in the hard times, love is what gets you through. If I had left it the other way, I wouldn't have been able to perform it every night. It wouldn't have been true. You mentioned feeling like an outlier as a black kid who listened to rock. It made me think of how much rock itself has fallen outside of the mainstream. Definitely. I think it's lost some relevance for now. I think it got to the point where it was so based in aesthetics, the skinny jeans and everything, that it was almost a joke. If you said you were in an indie band, people would kind of roll their eyes at you. So right now, it's in a bit of a timeout. But everything goes in cycles. The good thing is, if you're making rock and indie now, you're definitely not doing it to be cool, or make millions of dollars. And I think sometimes that's how you get those game-changing albums that shock people with something that feels real and true and unexpected. I definitely think music could do with something like that again."

This five-bedroom villa is nestled in a rocky hillside overlooking Kalo Livadi, one of the longest sandy beaches on Mykonos, the Greek island in the Aegean Sea. The 2,600-square-foot house, a three-story version of the quintessential sugar-cube homes of the Cyclades Islands, was built in 2015 from whitewashed concrete with accents of local stone. Known as ""Morgan,"" it sits on half an acre in the southeastern part of the island. The property was designed with a sense of fun and romance, said Savvas Savvaidis, president and chief executive of Greece Sotheby's International Realty, which has the listing. ""You have the luxury to enjoy outdoor living,"" he said, with several separate entertainment and relaxation areas, from the curved infinity pool and cliffside hot tub to a screening area with comfy seating to a beach bar with a DJ booth and room to dance. The outdoor kitchen has a beer station and a barbecue grill.

Straight ahead, the dining room easily seats 10 and has a picture window overlooking the property and the Aegean Sea beyond. To the left, the living room has sliding-glass doors to a covered terrace with a similar view. The white concrete base of the curved living room fireplace has an open shelf to one side. The other side wraps a corner, becoming the foundation for sofa cushions. From the back of the sofa, the concrete extends toward the kitchen in a half-moon shape as a breakfast counter. The kitchen has concrete countertops and lower cabinets accented with blue-gray wood doors and a bright blue Fischer & Paykel refrigerator. Lower cabinets extend into a hallway with a glass door opening to outdoor stairs down to the pool level. Ceilings are covered with white painted wood planks and matching beams. Floors throughout are gray and white polished cement, the traditional Cycladic ""patiti tsimentokonia,"" said George Kasimis, an agent at Greece Sotheby's International Realty.

Next to the kitchen, a curved staircase leads up to an antique wood door opening into the master bedroom, with en suite bath and private veranda with sea views. Each of the four bedrooms on the lower level has an en suite bath with a shower; three have ceiling fans and open to the outdoor areas. The front bedroom has a sliding door to a covered terrace with a Paola Lenti double-seater swing. The property is being sold furnished. To one side of the pool area, a long, curved sofa is built into a stone wall. Beyond the outdoor kitchen, a dining area is under cover.

Hidden lights installed into the rocky hillside create a ""super-cool ambience at night"" for parties at the ""secret disco"" that in the past has attracted celebrities, Mr. Kasimis said. The Greek island of Mykonos, with about 10,000 residents, beckons tourists with its sunny climate and vibrant culture. The villa is a five-minute drive to Kilo Livadi beach, which has two popular restaurants and, on the golden sands, rows of thatched palapa umbrellas shading lounge chairs. Just over a mile away is Ano Mera, a traditional Greek village with shopping, tavernas, bakeries and cafes with outdoor seating. The house is a 15-minute drive from cosmopolitan Mykonos town, also known as Chora. Mykonos International Airport is 18 minutes away.

For the past few years, Mykonos has been a global magnet for the rich and famous, drawn by its premium nightlife, international restaurants and 16th-century windmills. ""Mykonos, because of its robust luxury property market and its strong appeal to high-end tourism, led the recovery of the Greek property market as early as 2014 while the rest of the country followed a couple of years later,"" Mr. Savvaidis said. Since 2015, the luxury market, ranging from about $1.1 million to $13.6 million, has grown in sales volume ""on average by 15 percent year to year, per year,"" he said. The island ""gained a lot of visibility around the world by attracting second-home buyers,"" said Georg Petras, chief executive of Engel & Volkers in Greece, ""making it one of the top international second-home destinations.""

Still, Mr. Savvaidis said, at the high end, prices between 7,000 euros and 10,000 euros a square meter ($929 to $1,022 a square foot) are ""way lower"" than similar second-home markets in the Mediterranean. Condominiums are ""scattered around the island,"" said Ioannis Revithis, owner of Mykonos Real Estate and a former president of the Greek Real Estate Federation. New condos, no higher than two stories by law, are being built mostly in the ""blue zone,"" an area encompassing several coastal villages in the southern part of the island. Many have sea views, while others are in walking distance of the Aegean and ""some even have private beaches,"" Mr. Revithis said.

Prices for a studio, one- or two-bedroom apartment start at about 250,000 euros ($280,000), he said. Mr. Savvaidis said that despite -- or perhaps because of -- the coronavirus pandemic, during April and May his agency saw a ""surge and explosion of requests,"" registering a 166 percent increase year to year in ""qualified leads."" He attributed the inquiries to Greece's flat curve during the Covid-19 crisis, a result of the ""immediate lockdown measures"" taken by the government when neighboring Italy was overwhelmed. (There were 180 recorded deaths in Greece as of June 8, compared with 33,899 in Italy.) ""The people complied,"" he said. ""This is now considered a safe place."" Besides the precautionary measures taken, Mr. Petras said, ""the consequences are not going to be dramatic"" for the housing market because the pandemic hit Greece during an off-season for tourists. ""Right now, Greece is promoted as a best-example country in the reaction of the crisis and it is ready to start officially the touristic period,"" he said. He called 2020 year ""a chance year"" for investors and buyers as the market is ""reorganized"" and ""stabilized"" under new circumstances, ""offering right now smart investment opportunities."""
37650,Brace Yourself in Act II: Trigger Warnings Come to the Stage,"A number of American theaters are posting specific and comprehensive advisories about sensitive material, while others are resisting the trend.","A warning sign at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts advised audience members about loud noises, violent scenes and other potentially upsetting material in the play ""Vietgone.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/arts/00triggerplays4/00triggerplays4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6012e38dbfeac357a740e7940bbf03b955a6db0c8cb8eccf51c808be3918b2f5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/theater/trigger-warnings-plays-theater.html,453700ca-a171-53f1-b6a7-1661229194ae.jpg,"Brace Yourself in Act II: Trigger Warnings Come to the Stage

DENVER -- The warning sign was just outside the theater door. ""Please be advised,"" it cautioned, in capital letters. ""This production contains: Strobe lighting effects. Sudden loud noises. Theatrical fog/haze. Scenes of violence. Adult language. Sexual situations. Adult humor and content."" The subject was a play called ""Vietgone,"" about a Vietnamese couple who meet in a refugee camp in Arkansas during the Vietnam War. The Denver Center Theater Company was proud to present the boisterous comedy, but it was taking few chances about surprising audiences: Online, patrons who hovered over an alert on the theater's website could get pop-up details on the timing of the show's explosions. Not so long ago, a theatergoer was handed a program, shown to a seat and left to enjoy the show. Then came notices about strobe lights and smoking. But now, following a trend bubbling up from college campuses, theaters across the country are offering increasingly comprehensive and specific trigger warnings. The phenomenon has led to searching discussions at theaters large and small, pitting a traditional impulse -- to preserve art's ability to surprise, shock and stir -- against a modern desire to accommodate sensitivities and not alienate paying customers.

""This production may trigger an adverse reaction,"" Baltimore Center Stage said of ""Wasted,"" a play about the aftermath of an alcohol-fueled sexual encounter. In Sarasota, Fla., Asolo Repertory Theater not only disclosed ""potentially disturbing, realistically depicted gun violence"" in ""Gloria,"" which depicts a workplace shooting, but also included plot particulars in a spoiler section on its website. Philadelphia's Interact Theater Company went one step further: In addition to warning that ""Sensitive Guys"" dealt with sexual assault, the company designated a ""safe space"" in the lobby and invited representatives of Women Organized Against Rape to talk to patrons upset by the material. Even theatrical war horses are not exempt: For its recent production of ""Oklahoma!,"" St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn handed out a black card when patrons picked up their tickets, warning of gunshots as well as ""moments of darkness and violence"" and offering guidance for those who feel compelled to walk out. Trigger warnings have, of course, become part of the college experience, surviving mockery and concerns about censorship to win acceptance, if not broad approval. Now demand for those warnings is spreading among the wider public. ""People who have grown up with warnings now expect them,"" said Becky Witmer, the managing director of ACT Theater in Seattle.

But Shakespeare was plenty violent, too. ""What's different now is that there is genuine consideration given to the unseen and unknown potential for harm when someone is traumatized in ways that could have been avoided,"" said James Bundy, dean of the Yale School of Drama. Not everyone likes the idea, though, and some arts leaders maintain that theater should be unsettling and provocative. ""We have a generation coming of age that expects to be protected from discomfort, and a lot of companies succumb to that,"" said Susie Medak, the managing director of Berkeley Repertory Theater. ""To me, it's a frustrating trend -- what's the point of experiencing art if you don't expect to be surprised?"" Her theater does not provide trigger warnings but instead advises those with concerns about specific forms of content to call the box office and ask. Joseph Haj, the artistic director of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, said that he did not like trigger warnings but had made peace with giving people a heads-up about what to expect.

The theater's recent production of ""Frankenstein"" featured a ""content advisory"" alerting patrons to ""strobe lights, haze, simulated gunshots and scenes depicting physical and sexual violence."" Mr. Haj, reflecting on his conflicted feelings about the issue, said: ""As grown-up people, we should be able to grapple with difficult ideas together. That said, audiences don't like to be jumped."" Although trigger warnings are often thought of as a phenomenon of the political left, theaters in socially conservative parts of the country are also embracing more descriptive content alerts. ""In our market, strong language and sexual innuendo tend to be the leading causes of negative patron reactions,"" said Katie Perkowski, the marketing director for the Alabama Shakespeare Festival. She said that some audience members had even walked out of ""Annie"" because Daddy Warbucks said ""damn."" ""Vietgone"" is more adult than ""Annie"" -- it is peppered with vulgarities and includes scenes of sex and violence as well as discussion of wartime trauma -- and leaders of the Denver theater started thinking about how to handle that as soon as they read the script, which was written by Qui Nguyen and previously had a well-reviewed Off Broadway production. ""We're all just trying to find the line between setting people's expectations and not treating them like children and not giving away the core of the story,"" said Chris Coleman, the artistic director.

""I don't love telegraphing too much about the show,"" said the director, Amanda Berg Wilson. ""I want everything about the piece to be experienced in real time."" But she acquiesced, saying she was won over by the theater's concern for its patrons. And the warning does not seem to have deterred theatergoers; the musical was a hit. Even a show like ""Hair,"" which shocked some when it opened on Broadway in 1968 but went on to run for 1,750 performances, has earned alerts in the current environment. But the Dallas Theater Center approached the task with humor. ""WARNING,"" it announced on its website.

1252,Roger Scruton Was a Conservative. But What Kind?,"The philosopher, who died this month, defied stereotypes by remaining true to his moral sensibility.",Roger Scruton in 2018.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/opinion/29stone-george1/29stone-george1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=054a627d2b0616ae60e7dd010ee623f36a404c188300425194b3f8cc0608bb97&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/opinion/roger-scruton.html,1a3dbd1c-e77f-5985-924a-af1fec289ed1.jpg,"Indeed, Roger was the leading philosophical defender of love of home and one's own, what he called ""oikophilia."" Of course, as a humanist and Christian he recognized duties to all of humanity -- even duties of love (understood as being less about feeling than about willing): All are brothers and sisters under the fatherhood of God, who made us all in his own image. But Roger also held that one naturally and rightly has a special love for, and duties toward, members of one's family, tradition of faith, local community and region, and fellow citizens.

Roger's oikophilia, and his rejection of ""multiculturalism"" (which he considered anti-cultural in that it melted the different cultures into a monoculture of contemporary upscale progressive ideology), provoked ignorant and excitable people to accuse him of xenophobia and racism. In fact, Roger respected other cultures a great deal more than most progressives of my acquaintance do. He learned Arabic in order to read the Quran, and he admired the tradition-transcending contributions of the great medieval Islamic philosophers. He made careful, in-depth studies of Hindu and other Eastern traditions of faith precisely in search of the wisdom he regarded them as possessing.

Roger often explained his conservatism with a sound bite, which, naturally, oversimplified matters. He told the story of watching protesters in the streets from the window of his apartment in Paris in May 1968, and realizing that building things of value (communities, societies, nations, legal and economic systems, institutions of civil society) is hard and takes time, while destroying them is easy and often accomplished in a flash. It was then, he said, that he became, or realized that he was, a conservative.

Moreover, he recognized that the most important things people build, even more important than the cathedrals and great works of art and music he so loved, are not primarily the result of planning. They develop organically over time, with trial and error, as the work of many hands (an example is the common law of England). Recognizing this, conservatives should, he argued, seek to protect these things against those who would tear them down out of a misguided zeal for what they saw as the demands of liberty, equality, social justice or even the free market.

The conservative can cheer moderate reforms (organic things do grow and therefore change), but the conservative's fundamental goal is to conserve. That spirit, by the way, made Roger an ardent, but old-fashioned and therefore moderate, conservationist -- a kind of Green Tory who believed responsible stewardship of the natural order crucial. He thought that good stewardship begins with regard for the local landscape and architecture.

Left-wing philosophers -- heirs, in a sense, to 1789 -- believe that philosophy's point is to chart how the world should be remade. In Marx's words, ""The philosophers have thus far merely interpreted the world; the point is to change it."" As if to play the role of Marx's straight men for one of his pithiest lines, some conservative philosophers have sought to explain that the social world is as it is (or was what it was until the left somehow changed it) because it had to be that way and cannot be substantially changed.

Roger was a different kind of conservative philosopher. True, he did not think philosophy, or anything else, could usefully plan or radically reform the world. He was not a Marxist even in that limited sense. There was none of the spirit of 1789, or 1968, in him. But he believed that philosophy can help us see the value of good, if imperfect, things -- communities, institutions -- that have grown up organically, and that it can show us why we should fight to preserve them and how we can make our own contribution to their development, sometimes even by way of moderate reforms.

Guests could shoot baskets, play Donkey Kong or simply sip Champagne.



LOS ANGELES -- Hermes played host to a carnival-like evening of cocktails, runway looks and dancing on Thursday night at an industrial warehouse that lay just beyond the usual routes taken by the fashion crowd. ""Thanks to all of you and your GPS for being here with us,"" Axel Dumas, Hermes chief executive, told the few hundred people who attended the esteemed brand's first presentation of men's wear on the West Coast in its 180-year history.

At the house's runway show to introduce its fall 2017 men's wear collection, held in Paris in January, the focus was very much on the clothes, which had a classic look. The Los Angeles event was something altogether different, and those attending were not part of the Los Angeles we are accustomed to seeing on screens at red carpet events or on reality shows.

West Coast fashion stalwarts like Josh Peskowitz and Greg Chait mingled with art honchos such as the gallerist Shaun Caley Regen and Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Men's wear editors like Nick Sullivan of Esquire made the trip from New York. Burberry, Tom Ford and Yves Saint Laurent have presented here in recent years, suggesting a westward tilt for the fashion industry, and Hermes was following suit with an event designed to embrace the city's dazzling spirit. After models wearing crisp knit polos, buttery leather pants and pieces from a new Hermes collection called Dwntwn Men made their way down a runway, the warehouse opened into a party space with separate chambers where guests could shoot baskets, try their luck at Donkey Kong and play D.J. by digging through the soundtracks of previous Hermes shows while sipping Champagne.

""The West Coast is an extraordinary place,"" Veronique Nichanian, the Parisian artistic director of the Hermes Men's Universe, said. ""It has magnificent energy -- with the music, with the technology, with contemporary art. It's a place of the moment, where I'd like to be. With the spring 2017 collection that I presented last summer, I was speaking of levity, of optimism, and it fit perfectly with Los Angeles."" While buzzy designers like Virgil Abloh and Gosha Rubchinskiy can introduce a shoe or sweatshirt and watch youngsters go nuts, the venerable Hermes approaches fashion in a more considered manner. ""There's two different things we are always mixing,"" Mr. Dumas said. ""One is a house of tradition and craftsmanship, and the other one is not to take ourselves too seriously and to be whimsical. My uncle always used to say that at Hermes, we should always keep a child's eyes. Not to be childish, but to keep this light way of seeing things."""
39063,"Competitive Tobogganing in Maine. Well, Sort Of Competitive.","In February, the snow-globe town of Camden, Me., holds the U.S. National Toboggan Championships. The Olympics it is not. But my family braved the chute.",The closed toboggan chute near Hosmer Pond.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/22/travel/22MAINE-JP2/22MAINE-JP2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=88d340300e45a0081909a4b047196c89b41c82d9f86f64684c15d6eb793c2e87&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/travel/maine-toboggan-sledding-winter-championships.html,9dd7df61-f9c3-58d1-bcc2-db993e4741c7.jpg,"This is the time of year when folks in Camden, Me., begin thinking about ice. Not the ice on the roads or the ice on the driveway, the slick, hazardous stuff that one must avoid, scrape, salt or clear. But the all-important ice on Hosmer Pond, just south of town, and the 440-foot wooden chute that spills out onto it. Without a solid sheet of slippery ice on the chute, and the pond, there can be no toboggan races in this seaside community set on the rocky Atlantic coast 190 miles north of Boston. And without local residents squaring off in the annual races, to be staged this winter on the weekend of Feb. 10, what would be the point of the other festivities: the snowplow parade on Main Street, or the fireworks over Penobscot Bay? In Camden, anyway, it would hardly feel like winter. And this is a place where folks revel in that feeling. Every year since 1991, Camden has staged the U.S. National Toboggan Championships. The name suggests a competition of professional sledders with years of training on a luge. But the races are less Olympics and more winter festival, a reason to gather in the coldest, darkest months of the year and compete on the ice chute, at the foot of the Camden Snow Bowl, the local ski mountain, owned by the town. Anyone with a wooden toboggan meeting specifications can enter the competition. No experience is necessary. Just pay your registration fee and you're in. Still, expertise matters. There are gurus of the ice chute, regulars who compete every year. Perhaps more important, there are the residents who know how to build the perfect sled, created from ash, as the native peoples did it long ago. Four hundred teams participate, traveling from down the road or as far away as San Diego for the thrill of the races. More than 5,000 attend, setting up their snowbound tailgates, where mulled wine and beer flow easily, warming frozen spirits and providing liquid courage to the meek.

I had visited Camden in the summer, when the harbor is dotted with sailboats, the salty air is warm (or as warm as it ever gets here), and Interstate 95 nearby is a parking lot of S.U.V.s with out-of-state plates laden with bicycles, kayaks, and enough beach gear to mount an invasion of Canada. And without a doubt, the town is worth a visit then. Camden -- a town of 4,850, roughly midway between Portland and Bar Harbor -- reads like a postcard from New England, written to itself. It rests on the shore of Penobscot Bay, a tight bundle of old Yankee structures hemmed into a strip of land where the mountains roll right into the sea. The Native American name for the Camden area is Megunticook, or big mountain harbor, and it still fits today. Mount Battie, with hiking trails and a motor road, rises 800 feet above downtown, rocky and wooded. In 1614 it was considered by Capt. John Smith to be ""a kinde of fortresse"" against invading enemies. Today, it's just scenic. The view from the top looks out over the ocean, all the way to Acadia National Park on clear days, and on the town down below, with its hip breakfast joints and cozy restaurants serving fresh seafood.

My wife and I soon learned that the hardy travelers, the frostbitten New Englanders and ice-fever adventurers, enjoy Camden in winter. And we knew right away: We wanted to be like them. We were recent transplants to the area, having moved from New Orleans to New Hampshire, and we wanted to assimilate, wanted to be fearless in the grips of the ice chute and bold in the face of bitter cold. We wanted to be toboggan racers. ""It's like regular sledding,"" I assured my two children, ages 8 and 6, last winter, adding quietly, ""Only a little faster."" Like any good parent, I was lying, of course, bending the truth to favor our plans. This wasn't going to be anything like regular sledding. It was going to be better.

""Do you have a table saw?"" Mr. Cox asked me on the phone two months before the races. No, I replied, cursing the measly circular saw I keep in the garage. ""But I could get one,"" I added, trying to sound resourceful. To me, building a toboggan seemed like part of the whole Maine experience. They are native to the region. Algonquin and Penobscot tribes used them to help transport items, in the snow and upon frozen rivers, but also in tidal flats, lugging supplies or buckets of fish after throwing a tow rope across their chests. In his 1940 book ""Penobscot Man,"" the anthropologist Frank Speck wrote that natives ""use the sled continually."" And new settlers from Europe, fishermen and shipbuilders primarily, would do the same. Nineteenth-century Mainers who toiled all day building giant, wooden four-mast schooners found no challenge in using scrap wood to construct 10-foot sleds. But me? A New Englander-come-lately? Different story. Even if I had a table saw, Mr. Cox explained, I would face other challenges at this late date, because building a proper toboggan requires more than just tools; it takes time. You start with 15-foot lengths of ash, cut with the grain, not against it. The wood needs to be pared down into slats, two to three inches wide, and maybe a quarter of an inch thick. ""Three-sixteenths is even better,"" Mr. Cox instructed me. The slats then need to be steamed and made pliable, and bent over a mold to give them that toboggan shape.

""You're going to break some,"" Mr. Cox said. ""I guarantee it."" That's why tobogganers seek out green wood, recently cut stock that isn't kiln-dried. Ideally, again, it will be ash. ""I've never done anything except ash,"" Mr. Cox said. So in addition to a table saw, I would need to find some ash -- not kiln-dried -- and a steam box, and a mold, and the time for building, at least a couple of weeks, probably more. ""It's a pretty big chore,"" he said. Which left me with two options: rent a toboggan, for $100, or buy one, for more like $350. By this point, I had developed a sort of sledding fever. In my mind, we were beginning a new family tradition: We would race our toboggan in winter. We needed a sled. So I called the Camden Toboggan Company (""Toboggans Built to Last, and Built to Win!"") and placed an order for one sled, fast and true. It was to be built by a man in nearby Rockport named Dave Nazaroff, a native Mainer and a contractor and homebuilder by trade. Toboggan building, for him, was just a sidelight; seasonal work. ""My toboggans,"" he told me, ""are always fast."" I winced, knowing I would surely fail him. With just our two children on board, we wouldn't have enough weight to be fast, no matter what Mr. Nazaroff did to the sled. Our plan was to enjoy the ride, survive the cold and compete in something we, as New Orleanians, understood: the toboggan race's costume contest.

The problem now was ice, enough on the chute and on Hosmer Pond to make the races possible. ""We worry about that stuff all the time,"" Mr. Cox told me. Last winter, because of unusually warm temperatures in the Northeast, the concerns in Camden reached panic levels. Across New England, soaring, springlike temperatures were forcing local officials to scrap beloved rites of winter. Ice fishing derbies: postponed. Sled-dog championships: canceled. Snowmobile trails were closed; pond hockey games moved. It wasn't looking good for the tobogganers. Then, just before the races, it got worse. Temperatures, already nearly four degrees above normal for the month of January, spiked all across Maine. For three days last February in Camden, thermometers topped 50 degrees, unheard-of highs for Maine in winter. The already tenuous ice on Hosmer Pond, a 54-acre body of water, began to melt, worrying the planners, the would-be participants and me. Even a last-minute snowstorm the day before the races couldn't save us.

The snow, and the cold, had come too late. Town officials declared the ice on Hosmer Pond too thin, and for the first time in three decades the chute was closed. Two days of racing would be condensed into one, to be held on a makeshift toboggan strip built out of snow, into the mountain itself. The real competitors scrambled, adjusting to the radical shift from hard ice to damp snow. The top teams were shooting to win in seven seconds, a challenge on the slushy snow. Some rubbed their sleds with ski wax; others used onion powder. ""I think we've got a chance,"" I heard a man tell his teammate at the check-in. I knew our team did not. Still, the kids were excited, and my wife and I were, too. Back at the hotel, we had made final adjustments of our own. Our costumes were almost ready. In the morning, my whole family was going to be covered entirely in purple, green and gold duct-taped stripes, a nod to where we had come from, New Orleans, and to where we were going. The theme at the toboggan races was Mardi Gras. Our team name: Purple, Green and Cold. It was time to take our shot at the holy grail of toboggan race times.

""You get in the sevens,"" one competitor told me, considering the conditions, ""and you got yourself a good shot at this thing."" In the morning, more than 325 teams came out to compete. A couple thousand came to watch. We weren't even close to being in the sevens, or anywhere respectable. With my older son riding in front, followed by my wife, my younger son and me, we came in at 11 seconds flat. Better than Just for Funzies (14.50), the Big Kahoonas (15.51) and the Party Animals, Bolt II and the Bandana Boggin Boys, all of whom crashed. But nowhere near the top sleds. The Local Yokels (8.00), Curiouser & Curiouser (8.15), Rocky Balboggan II (8.21) and the Dirigo Pups (8.79) led the way into the final round, which we watched, still clad in duct tape, standing in the cold with Abe Goodale, a local artist and the leader of the Pups. Mr. Goodale was the man I wished I was: a Mainer, born and raised. He had made the toboggan his team was now racing, using techniques he had learned as a boat builder. And now, as darkness fell on the mountain, his team, competing for the first time, was poised to win it all, surging into the lead in the finals.

""I'm so nervous,"" he told his teammates, eyeing the scoreboard. ""This is crazy."" There are some locals who don't attend the races anymore. They say they've gone too commercial, charging for parking spots and attracting too many outsiders. But the trophy ceremony revealed that the soul of the U.S. National Toboggan Championships remains intact, ice or no ice, no matter who is racing. The crowd still remaining at the end of the night, perhaps 100 people, stood in a circle, awash in the headlights of someone's car, among the busted-up hay bales at the bottom of the makeshift chute. The license plate on the car read GRZZLY. The plates were from Maine. The winners stepped forward to collect their trophies, which were shaped like miniature wooden toboggans. A team named Birthday Muscles had won the two-person division. Another, named Schooner Olad, claimed the three-person title. Goodale's Pups won the coveted four-person trophy, and the family in duct tape, those Southern transplants, Purple, Green, and Cold, won best costume.

My beaming children -- they wanted this -- stepped forward to accept the trophy while I half-apologized to Mr. Goodale, ashamed of the winnings in light of my inadequate sled-building skills. I wished that I had made my own toboggan, and that it had been faster, and that we had competed with the likes of teams named Rocky Balboggan. Mr. Goodale just smiled. I wondered if he was just being nice. But one thing was indisputable. We were champions, with the hardware to prove it. We weren't Mainers. But we had spent 10 hours outside, in the cold, on a mountain, in the middle of winter, dressed in duct tape, racing wooden sleds. We were in. ""See you next year,"" Mr. Goodale said."
51990,Hospitals in Safety Net Brace for Health Care Law's Repeal,"As the president-elect and Congress prepare to repeal the law, Temple University Hospital and others serving the poor expect harsh consequences.","Philadelphia skyscrapers seen from the Temple section of North Philadelphia, near Temple University Hospital, one of the most impoverished areas in the nation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/28/science/28HOSPITAL-1/27HOSPITAL2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=8c92559bb5e03bbc161051e138f2dd1519cc1d39868ea5fee71a78621e32dbdd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/health/hospitals-medicaid-obamacare-trump.html,081b7305-9b1e-5eb2-ad27-9fd6d222c7fa.jpg,"PHILADELPHIA -- Jason Colston Sr. went to the emergency room at Temple University Hospital last month with his calf swollen to twice its normal size. A bacterial infection had entered his bloodstream, requiring him to spend nine days at Temple, where patients are overwhelmingly poor. Mr. Colston, 36, had no insurance through his job at a 7-Eleven, but it turned out he was eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Temple helped him enroll as soon as he was admitted, and Medicaid paid for his stay and continuing treatment. Before the health law, the hospital had to absorb the cost of caring for many uninsured patients like Mr. Colston. Now, with President-elect Donald J. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress vowing to dismantle the law, Temple and other hospitals serving the poor are bracing for harsh financial consequences that could have a serious effect on the care they provide. Since the election, hospitals have been among the loudest voices against wholesale repeal of the health law. In a letter to Mr. Trump and congressional leaders this month, the two biggest hospital trade groups warned of ""an unprecedented public health crisis"" and said hospitals stood to lose $165 billion through 2026 if more than 20 million people lose the insurance they gained under the law. They predicted widespread layoffs, cuts in outpatient care and services for the mentally ill, and even hospital closings.

Here in Pennsylvania, where the health law has brightened the financial outlook of hospitals statewide, many are scrambling to assess how repeal would affect their bottom line and the patients they serve. The stakes are particularly high for safety-net hospitals like Temple, but even more prosperous hospitals face uncertainty after investing in new ways to deliver care under the law. Temple executives estimate their system could lose as much as $45 million a year if the law were entirely repealed, which would return it to the losses it posted for years before the health law took effect. ""We are the de facto community hospital in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country,"" said Robert Lux, the senior vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer of Temple University Health System, which includes two general hospitals and a cancer center. ""Any kind of change like this would not only push Temple University Hospital into financial extremis, it would do the same thing for our entire system."" Not far from Temple, Main Line Health, a nonprofit hospital system in the affluent Philadelphia suburbs, is far better positioned to weather the financial impact of repeal. While Temple has one of the poorest patient populations in the state -- about half of its patients are on Medicaid -- Main Line, which has an outpatient clinic in an upscale mall and another with a fitness center outfitted with filtered saltwater pools, has few Medicaid patients.

So, too, could Temple's efforts to connect its newly insured patients with preventive care instead of waiting until they show up in the emergency room with advanced, expensive illnesses. Dr. Robert McNamara, chairman of emergency medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, said he had seen more than a few uninsured people arrive in the emergency room with kidney failure, needing costly dialysis for the rest of their lives because they had lived with high blood pressure for so long. Main Line Health's financial picture is much stronger, and will most likely remain so even if the health law is repealed and replaced with a program that leaves far fewer people insured. Main Line ended the 2016 fiscal year with $106.8 million in operating income and a 6.5 percent operating margin, compared with Temple's margin of 0.2 percent. Still, Main Line has invested substantially in efforts to improve the care it provides its patients while lowering the cost, as the Affordable Care Act encourages. As with many hospitals across the country, these efforts -- like preventing readmissions and focusing more heavily on primary care, especially for patients with chronic diseases -- have caused the system's inpatient population to drop.

""If you don't have a strong payer mix or a healthy bottom line,"" Mr. Lynch said, ""it's very difficult to do those things."" One major question for Temple and other safety-net hospitals is whether states would restore supplemental funds or programs that defrayed the cost of caring for the uninsured before the health law took effect. Pennsylvania, for example, paid for emergency medical care for certain low-income people who did not qualify for Medicaid. This allowed Temple to be paid for their inpatient care, but often not for the care they needed after being discharged. ""We don't know that that program would come back,"" Mr. Lux said, adding that the program used to pay for about $23 million a year worth of care provided at Temple University Hospital. Mr. Colston, who was still returning daily to Temple for intravenous antibiotics a month after his discharge, would have qualified to have most of his inpatient costs met under the old state-financed program. Paul Fabian, who received a double lung transplant at Temple last year after getting a subsidized private insurance policy from the Affordable Care Act marketplace, would not have qualified at all. Mr. Fabian, who suffered from emphysema and chronic lung failure, said he sold his truck to afford his $262 monthly premiums. ""If you walk into the E.R. they have to help you,"" Mr. Fabian, 61, said. ""But if you have a condition like I had, what's the hospital's obligation?"" Temple officials said that without insurance, Mr. Fabian would have had to endure a two-year waiting period to qualify for Medicare coverage for his disability. ""We were finally in a situation where for most of our patients there was a coverage option,"" said Anita Colon, Temple's director of patient financial services, already speaking about the health law in the past tense. ""Now there's just a total unknown about what will be left."""
8286,"Virginie Despentes Makes France Angry, but Things Are Changing","With her strident, pro-sex views, Despentes upsets people on the left and right. After years of being ignored and derided, she is finally being welcomed by France's literary establishment.",The writer Virginie Despentes in her Paris neighborhood on June 16. The second volume of her &ldquo;Vernon Subutex&rdquo; trilogy is out in English in the United States in July.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/arts/23despendes1/23despendes1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d1da3b8a55cf5330a3a9f62dd1c78b31f8d13efcfae4771819e3c68f08c108df&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/books/virginie-despentes.html,2efc7462-9932-5e03-9ca2-72a39014a48e.jpg,"The writer Virginie Despentes in her Paris neighborhood on June 16. The second volume of her ""Vernon Subutex"" trilogy is out in English in the United States in July.





PARIS -- Nearly three decades into her career, the feminist French author and filmmaker Virginie Despentes still has a way of riling people up -- right across the political spectrum. While her views have long been unpalatable to social conservatives, her support for prostitution and pornography have gone a step too far for many on the left, too. In early June, an open letter addressed to her ""white friends,"" in support of anti-racism protests in France, prompted some activists of color to accuse her of divisiveness. Some critics said that in adopting the language of structural racism and white privilege, Despentes was importing American ideas unsuited to describing France's situation. But Despentes doesn't mind the pushback. ""I've been comparing it to the #MeToo movement. At the time, I wished more men would have spoken up,"" she said this month in an interview at her home in Paris. ""Criticism is normal.'"" If anyone has learned to weather public hostility, it's Despentes. For years after her first novel, ""Rape Me,"" published in 1993 about two women's murderous road trip, few in the bourgeois world of French literature took her seriously. Her provocative stories made it easy to paint her as an untamable ""enfant terrible."" In 2000, a movie adaptation of ""Rape Me,"" co-directed by Despentes, stirred a moral panic in France, where it was pulled from mainstream theaters days after its release. It remains banned in some countries, including Australia, for its explicit depiction of sexual violence.

Still, as a novelist, Despentes has recently completed a remarkable takeover of the literary institutions that once painted her as an outsider. Her latest novels, ""Apocalypse Baby"" and the trilogy ""Vernon Subutex,"" won multiple awards, with reviewers comparing her to the 19th-century author Honore de Balzac. From 2016 to 2020, she was on the jury for France's most prestigious literary award, the Goncourt Prize. With its slang-infused verve, ""Vernon Subutex"" has also earned Despentes renewed attention in the English-speaking world; the first volume made the Booker International Prize shortlist in 2018. The second volume is out in translation in the United States on July 7, and the final book in the trilogy will be available in Britain on June 25. (Farrar, Straus and Giroux plans to release the third volume in the United States in 2021, a spokeswoman for the publisher said.) The saga, published in France between 2015 and 2017, struck a chord here at a time of heightened anxiety. In it, a large cast of misfits -- including former porn stars, drifters and bigots -- coalesces around the books' antihero, Vernon, a homeless former record dealer. The first volume was published on the day of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in 2015, and the events of that day and the subsequent attack at the Bataclan, the Paris music venue, feature later in the trilogy. Her writing process was ""a collage,"" Despentes said: ""I try to take a Polaroid picture of what is happening while it's happening.""

""Vernon Subutex"" came on the heels of a transformational period in Despentes' life. In 2005, she took a road trip around the United States to film a documentary about pro-sex feminists, ""Mutantes (Feminisme Porno Punk)."" Along the way, she fell in love with the camerawoman; at 35, she came out as a lesbian. The next year, she moved to Barcelona with a new partner, the philosopher and transgender activist Paul B. Preciado. Around the same time, she released ""King Kong Theory,"" a blistering essay about sex and gender, that frankly discussed her own experiences of sexual violence. ""It's as if people suddenly had a road map for what I was doing: 'Oh, OK, she was raped. We get it now,'"" she said, deadpan. Many critics see Despentes' willingness to talk frankly about sexual abuse as paving the way for the#MeToo movement in France. When she moved back from Barcelona to Paris, in 2010, Despentes was shocked by the growing influence of the far right in France, she said, including among her acquaintances. ""The right was suddenly obsessed with the Roma people, with Islam. As a novelist, it made me curious,"" she said. In ""Vernon Subutex,"" she created racist characters to explore their ways of thinking, leaving readers to draw their conclusions. ""What's wonderful with a novel is that there is space for complexity,"" Despentes said. ""People always have reasons to think as they do."" The French actress Beatrice Dalle, a close friend of the writer, said in a phone interview that this was in keeping with Despentes' attitude in life. ""She doesn't try to lecture people. She has a very personal take on morality,"" she said.

In 2019, ""Vernon Subutex"" was adapted into a TV series starring the French actor Romain Duris. (It is available on the streaming platform Topic in the United States.) But Despentes said she felt the script had simplified the books so much that it missed the point: She hadn't even watched it, she added. ""If you take away the politics, the rise of the far right, the feminist aspect, what's left is a sort of detective investigation. If I were Agatha Christie, I'd do that all the time. But I'm not."" Despentes hasn't worked for the screen since ""Bye Bye Blondie,"" a 2012 adaptation of her novel of the same name, which starred Dalle as a lesbian punk. She would like to write and direct a TV series, she said, but can't abide the ""deep-seated undercurrent of misogyny"" in France's movie and television industry. In March, after Roman Polanski, who has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women, was named best director at France's equivalent of the Oscars, Despentes' reaction -- another open letter, ""From now on, we get up and we leave"" -- took off on social media. (Polanski denies the allegations.) Instead of directing, she has recently been performing onstage, most recently in the feminist musical production ""Viril,"" alongside Dalle and the rapper Casey. As she delivered monologues about women's experiences of abuse, by authors including Preciado and Leslie Feinberg, Despentes was calmly powerful. Despentes said she had worked hard in recent years on managing her anger, which she once feared would ""burn everyone around her,"" damaging relationships as well as her work. She enjoyed the rapturous reception for ""Vernon Subutex,"" she said, but added that consensus had never been her goal. ""It's nice to have a period of time when you feel loved, accepted, when you're very well paid. But if you're loved all the time, you're dead,"" Despentes said, laughing. ""It's not a writer's job."""
48231,"With Romance Novels Booming, Beefcake Sells, but It Doesn't Pay","This corner of the book world is red hot and among the most innovative, with e-books and apps, and it needs a steady stream of fresh-faced cover models.","Jason Aaron Baca poses for a romance novel cover in the studio of photographer Portia Shao.

But when Mr. Baca, 42, slipped on a pair of dark aviator glasses recently, he looked remarkably like Tom Cruise in ""Top Gun."" He was dressed for work in a khaki military jumpsuit. And even though it was barely noon, he had already stopped by the gym to make sure his biceps and legs looked combat-strong. His assignment: To be a military helicopter pilot saved in a crash by a female rescuer with whom he once had a torrid affair. Now that they're reunited, their passions have flared. Mr. Baca is a cover model for romance novels. He has been on nearly 500 book covers, by his own account -- one of scores of men like him vying to be heroic heartthrobs. Not since the flaxen-haired Fabio Lanzoni dominated drugstore book racks in the 1980s and 1990s, with his lion's mane and bulging biceps, have cover models been in such demand.

After a few more clicks of the shutter, he and Ms. Shao paused to examine his work on a 2-by-4-foot television screen. ""It looks good because it has everything,"" Mr. Baca said. The smoldering gaze. A glimpse of his six-pack abs. Mr. Baca had even thrust his pelvis forward, a trick he learned to make his stomach appear flatter and ensure the ladies looked, well, you know, there. Romance writers and publishers, as it happens, are among publishing's most innovative participants. They were early to digital serialization. Booksellers, too, now crowdsource ideas to find fresh writers. And if you want to explore a virtual relationship, you can try a romance-novel app. How hot are romance novels? Over all, annual sales totaled $1.08 billion in 2013, according to the Romance Writers of America, which tracks sales. And their popularity is expected to grow. Last year Scribd, an e-book subscription service, sharply reduced the number of romance and erotica novels it offered because it couldn't afford to keep up with readers' appetites. (Scribd pays publishers every time a book is read and loses money if a book is too popular.) Despite the perception that blockbusters like ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" drive sales, self-publishing has proved a boon for this particular genre. E-books make up nearly 40 percent of all purchases, according to the writers group. And there are categories for every reader's taste, among them, adventure, Christian, multicultural, L.G.B.T. and paranormal.

Enter Mr. Baca. Authors and publishers require a revolving door of new faces, which, while hard to estimate, tally somewhere in the hundreds each year. Ms. Shao displays an image from Mr. Baca's photo shoot on a television screen. The image on the cover can be pivotal to selling a novel, and publishers require a revolving door of new faces. Laura Morton for The New York Times 'Tired of Looking at Men's Abs' ""I never thought I would say this,"" said Liz Pelletier, the chief executive of the romance novel company Entangled Publishing. ""But I am so tired of looking at men's abs. I don't know if these ones are sexier than those other ones."" ""It used to be that everyone wanted Fabio,"" she added. Today, though, individualism prevails. ""Readers don't want every book to have the same face."" It was January and Ms. Pelletier was bemoaning how tough the search for a perfect cover model can be. Entangled Publishing is five years old, one of the newer entrants to an industry whose identity is synonymous with Harlequin, the Canadian publisher, which in the early 1950s started publishing chaste romance stories set in hospitals and medical offices. Harlequin reached its zenith in the United States in the 1970s when reader appetite shifted to more sexually explicit fare, known as ""bodice rippers"" or ""sweet and savages."" Sexy still sells. At Brazen, Entangled's more risque fiction line, Ms. Pelletier said book covers with male models sold three times as much as with a woman alone. And for new authors in particular, ""the cover is really critical,"" said Dianne Moggy, vice president for romance fiction at Harlequin.

Unlike the Fabio era, when covers were painted by hand, today they are more assembly line than art. Consider Daemon Black, a space alien with dark curls and emerald green eyes who is the hero of Entangled's Lux series, written by the New York Times best-selling author Jennifer L. Armentrout. In 2011, Pepe Toth saw a photograph of himself and his then model girlfriend, Sztella Tziotziosz, on the cover of ""Obsidian,"" the first in the Lux series, published that December. Mr. Toth, 26, then living in his native Hungary, had been transformed into Daemon Black without his knowledge. ""I thought, what kind of book is this?"" he said in a recent interview. Mr. Toth, a professional soccer player, learned that Ms. Armentrout had used a stock photo taken from a shoot he and his girlfriend had done three years earlier in Budapest. So, he emailed the author. ""I'm the guy on your book,"" he said he wrote. Ms. Armentrout invited him to visit the United States. In June 2012, Mr. Toth and his girlfriend flew to Atlanta after Entangled organized ""#DaemonInvasion,"" a promotion for Lux fans. ""When I landed, I said to Jennifer, 'I don't know you,'"" he recalled. ""She said, 'But you have a lot of fans.'"" He and his girlfriend filmed trailers to promote the series and accompanied the writer on a book tour. At the FoxTale Book Shoppe in Woodstock, Ga., one afternoon, Mr. Toth found himself surrounded by almost 50 cheering women. ""People called out to me, 'Oh, Daemon is here!'"" he said. One woman started crying. ""She didn't want to step up to have a book signed because she was so happy,"" he said. ""It was really weird."" Seated at the table from left are Drew Leighty, Jennifer Armentrout and Pepe Toth at a book signing in Savannah, Ga. Mr. Leighty and Mr. Toth have both been on covers of Ms. Armentrout's novels. Adam Kuehl for The New York Times

Today, he posts book signings on his Twitter account, @Daemon_Black, and he reads excerpts on YouTube. And when Entangled considered dropping him from the cover after he split up with his girlfriend, Ms. Pelletier said, ""There was a revolt from readers."" Now Mr. Toth is featured alone. If covers were hand-painted in acrylic back in the Fabio era, the tool of the trade today is Photoshop. Heads are cut off midface if a model is overexposed. Parts of different photos can be pieced together like a Picasso portrait. Toes, too, are deleted if they clash with the book's title. For Mr. Baca's helicopter-pilot shoot in Santa Cruz, Eileen Nauman, a writer better known by her pseudonym, Lindsay McKenna, emailed a series of guidelines. She wanted to see him looking alert, with a ""slight, playful, teasing smile"" and, she wrote, with his ""flight suit open to sternum, showing off your great body, but nothing too flagrant or obvious."" ""The cover of an e-book is the size of a postage stamp,"" she said. ""Everyone has about three seconds to peruse, and the first hook is going to be that cover."" Few romance models, if any, make enough money to eke out a living. Mr. Baca, for example, works at the Housing Authority of the Santa Clara County, Calif., as a customer-service clerk. And although he has an agent, he said he earned only $20,000 in his best year. This, despite the fact that he is a tireless self-promoter who fancies himself the next Fabio. Industry executives say it will be difficult to topple the king. ""Nobody did it better than Fabio,"" said Allison Kelley, executive director of the romance writers group. ""He really did create the brand.""

Mr. Baca's dream had always been to be on the cover of Playgirl. In his 2004 book, ""Journey of a Male Model,"" Mr. Baca wrote that a Seattle photographer once shot him nude for a possible Playgirl spread. Instead, those photos landed on the cover of gay men's magazines under a pseudonym. Mr. Baca said he did not know then to secure the rights to his photographs. (For the curious, he finally made Playgirl in 2004.) And he maintains he doesn't do it for the money. Instead, cover modeling gives him a taste of fame in an otherwise low-key life. ""Nobody else knows this secret life,"" he said. ""They just think I'm Jason.""

What Color Is My Parachute For more than a decade, Jimmy Thomas, a fitness model with the swarthy physique of a gladiator or lusty pirate, has been a romance cover model and estimates he has been on thousands of covers. In 2008, he decided to start his own full-service stock-image website, called Romance Novel Covers, which he hoped would become a clearinghouse for not only his own photographs but also those of other models. Given the interest in romance, the idea seemed like a good one. But as self-publishing took off, a wave of new models stepped in, and the price of stock images plummeted. At the same time, self-published authors couldn't afford the prices paid by established companies. Today, a stock image of Mr. Thomas for an online book sells for about $10. A premade cover costs $45. Special orders tally about $300. ""My stock site basically pays my bills,"" said Mr. Thomas, who is 45. In 2013, with his photo business slowing, Mr. Thomas had a new idea: start his own convention. Fan conventions have long been a prized source of revenue for publishers, the granddaddy hosted by RT Book Reviews, a magazine for and by romance-book lovers who want to connect with authors. Conventions attract a steamy knot of admiring fans, and they want to meet the models. Next month, at the RT Booklovers Convention in Las Vegas, activities include ""America's Next Top Cover Model"" and ""Kickass Cowboys, Cops & Kisses,"" where fans can take photos with their favorite models. Mr. Thomas's more practical approach plays up sessions like taxes and self-publishing, and he concedes it hasn't actually taken off. But he knows his audience. This year, he has added a cover model search and ""The World's Best Male Exotic Dancer Competition."""
7805,"New York Police Will Stop Enforcing Street-Vendor Laws, but Questions Linger","Vendors, who feel harassed by officers and tickets, wonder what will replace the current system.","Sonía Pèrez has been selling tamales on the streets of Bushwick, Brooklyn, for two decades. She has long feared the police.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/12/dining/12nystreet-vendors1/12nystreet-vendors1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2944531ca474265ffe2dbaeadc6dd30d27a76393548b45010808f80601b6cf4c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/dining/nypd-street-vendors.html,306ce407-2de8-5c09-afbf-8e0671d1bc44.jpg,"Sonia Perez has been selling tamales on the streets of Bushwick, Brooklyn, for two decades. She has long feared the police.





After two decades selling homemade tamales in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Sonia Perez has received her fair share of tickets from the police. Often, they're for minor infractions: being too far from the curb, being too close to a crosswalk. But a few years ago, an encounter with the police frightened her. While checking to see her vendor license, Ms. Perez said, four officers harassed her oldest daughter, who they claimed was affiliated with a gang because she had tattoos and piercings. The officers also threatened Ms. Perez with a $50,000 fine, she said. That threat, she later found out, was empty. But it's part of a larger pattern of discrimination against Hispanic and black vendors, said Ms. Perez, a single mother who supports her four children with her business.

Ms. Perez was heartened by Mayor Bill de Blasio's announcement last Sunday that the New York Police Department would no longer enforce street-vendor regulations, but she is uncertain what it means for her and her business, and fears even steeper fines. ""He just said the police are not going to handle it anymore, but who is?"" she said. ""We don't want worse than police."" As protesters across the city and nation demand sweeping changes in law enforcement, Mr. de Blasio announced that a civilian agency would be created to enforce regulations instead of the police. He did not specify when the police would stop enforcement or whether vendors would still be subject to oversight by the other city departments that inspect or regulate them: fire, health, transportation, parks, sanitation and consumer affairs. Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for his office, did not answer questions about how people would be chosen to oversee the vendors, or how many. ""We are finalizing next steps,"" she wrote in an email.

The mayor also said he would redirect some police funding, but Ms. Lapeyrolerie would not confirm that money for the new agency would come from the Police Department. Protests sparked by the death of George Floyd have grown into calls to defund police departments. That would mean reducing police budgets and transferring civic regulations -- resolving family and school disputes, moving homeless people into shelters -- to other agencies. Vendor oversight would fall well within those bounds. ""It was a gesture,"" Carlos Menchaca, a City Council member, said of the mayor's announcement. ""I think it was to placate the people of New York.""

Street vendors are often the subject of complaints from store owners, business improvement districts, building managers and neighbors over noise, smells, sidewalk congestion and other nuisances. A public information officer for the Police Department said that enforcing the laws governing the vendors is vital to protecting public health, food safety and keeping sidewalks clear. ""We will work with City Hall to transition these responsibilities to the agency tasked with vendor enforcement going forward,"" she wrote in a Wednesday email. In 2018, long before the calls to defund the police, City Council members proposed a new framework for how vendors could be regulated: Intro 1116, a bill that has the support of more than half the Council but has not yet come up for a vote.

The measure outlines plans to create a civilian unit that would be trained to oversee both vendor enforcement and education. (Ms. Lapeyrolerie did not say whether the mayor would support the bill, which would need his signature.) The plan would also increase the number of permits available to food vendors for the first time in four decades, which Mr. Menchaca, a sponsor of Intro 1116, said could help the city's economic recovery from the pandemic. A bill to lift that cap is in committee in the State Senate. The Street Vendor Project of the Urban Justice Center, an advocacy group, estimates that there are 10,000 to 20,000 vendors across the five boroughs. But only 853 people receive nonfood permits, and only about 5,000 can legally vend food, according to Matthew Shapiro, the center's legal director. As with taxi medallions, the organization says capping the amount of permits is dangerous, because many vendors have to sell illegally, risking fines, property confiscation and arrest. There is a decade-long waiting list for permits, and an underground market where a two-year permit (officially issued by the city for $200) can sell for $25,000 or more. Mr. de Blasio's spokeswoman did not specify whether more licenses would be issued as part of the mayor's plan.

As people of color across the United States know, an interaction with law enforcement can be perilous. Eric Garner, who died in a police chokehold six years ago on a Staten Island sidewalk, was accused of selling cigarettes. Although Mr. Garner was not a licensed vendor, Mr. Attia said police harassment is widespread. ""Why is vending a crime?"" Mr. Attia asked. ""What city do we live in that making a living is being criminalized?"" Nogaye Lo, a 44-year-old vendor, has also had difficult encounters with the police at her stand in Union Square. Before the coronavirus pandemic, she sold seasonal wares: scarves in the winter, jewelry in the summer. Now, as demonstrators fill the park almost every night, she sells T-shirts bearing the faces of people who have been killed by the police. On the back, they read, ""Black Lives Matter."" For Ms. Lo, an immigrant from Senegal, the message is personal. She has four sons, and she fears what could happen to them whenever they leave the house. Officers regularly confront her, issuing tickets and confiscating her merchandise, she said. She has been arrested without cause, she said, and had to spend the night in jail. Once, an officer pushed her, putting his hands on her breasts, she said. He apologized, but she is still furious. ""We're not animals,"" she said. ""We're not garbage. We're human beings."" Even though she worries that a civilian agency could impose heavy fines, she fears the police more.

""Before you're leaving your house, you're thinking about if you're going to be sleeping in the house again,"" she said. ""All the time, when you're going out, you're thinking, 'Oh, cops are going to arrest me when I go to the table.' That's ridiculous."" A.C. Fernandez translated between Spanish and English for Sonia Perez."
13076,The Island Brokers Are Overwhelmed,"The wealthy want to escape the pandemic to a private, isolated paradise. The people who sell islands have to explain: It's complicated.",Gladden Private Island in Belize has generated more interest than any other rental for one broker. But it has proved difficult to get clients there during the pandemic.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/08/realestate/00xp-islandbroker-slide-ZYHP/00xp-islandbroker-slide-ZYHP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3acec33d8d1a5e0fdc96b91065067f02ba99c0c60a9a9fb49769ca9b7c4c12b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/realestate/private-islands-coronavirus.html,c4a95289-3975-552a-b14f-a7743bb53177.jpg,"Calls and emails come in at all times of day and night. They no longer concern fun or prestige. Instead they focus on fresh water and solar panels. These were not the inquiries they had grown used to. As the coronavirus pandemic has devastated countries around the world, it has upended nearly every aspect of life for everyone, including for those most insulated by money. Even the niche, ultrarich world of island commerce has been turned on its head. ""This has been the busiest two months I've had in 22 years of selling islands,"" Chris Krolow, the chief executive of Private Islands Inc., said in July. The pace has not slowed since then, he said. The only time he has ever had anywhere near this quantity of inquiries was shortly after the disastrous Fyre Festival on Great Exuma, in the Bahamas, in 2017. Mr. Krolow said he was swamped, for some reason, with questions from ""kids hoping to start their own country.""

""You have your yacht, your jet -- now you want your island,"" said John Christie, the president of Christie's International Real Estate, a firm based in the Bahamas. The island brokers knew how to cater to these clients. They sought a place to feel like a ""boss from sea to sea,"" Mr. Christie said, a little kingdom with no authority except their own. Deals could be sweetened by allusions to billionaire or celebrity neighbors. But this new wave of island buyers is less driven by ego than a desire to escape the virus, and brokers, like their clients, are newer to pondering survival. So even after a few harried months, brokers are struggling to meet their clients' new requests, like having agriculture to go with the helicopter landing pad. Despite the high interest driven by the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Krolow's firm, based in Canada, has closed only a few sales. Like other brokers, he says that much of his time has been consumed by setting expectations about what it actually takes to set up a self-sufficient island -- the logistics of paradise are complicated -- and figuring out how to show properties to potential buyers amid travel restrictions.

But renting is not enough for some wealthy people. The pandemic has fundamentally changed the way they're thinking -- long-term -- about being around other humans. ""Before, an island was a toy,"" said Marcus Gondolo-Gordon, the chief executive of Incognito Property based in England. Now clients describe dreams of a ""a bloody long boat ride"" to ensure that no one will cruise up and infringe on their isolation, he said. They also want access to fresh water, solar panels and a house that is ready to sleep in, tomorrow. Quickly setting up an island for self-sufficiency is going to be hard, Mr. Gondolo-Gordon has to tell them. Construction on private islands takes far more time than on the mainland or even on typical, nonprivate islands. And brokers cannot guarantee that islands will be safe havens from civil unrest. For example, just this week he looked at a lovely island in the eastern Mediterranean -- a steal at $7.4 million. But there are some tensions in those waters, which are contested by Turkey and Greece. ""You're going to have to read the news,"" he tells clients. And they'll also have to consider that their shoreline will most likely be affected by climate change. When they cannot handle this, he advises them to rent a superyacht.

Several buyers declined, through their brokers, to be interviewed about their experiences shopping for islands. Before the pandemic, most agents would sell islands as a boutique fraction of their broader real estate business. Now that many sellers report seeing a surge in island interest, several brokers said it was taking over more of their business. Still, Mr. Krolow is the rare broker who is all islands, all of the time. He helped sell his first island in the late '90s, almost accidentally, after accepting a seller's offer to put an ad for it on the small website about islands that he had created. Two decades later, Mr. Krolow's site features hundreds of islands. Some cost less than $100,000, like the small, rock-strewn strips of land in Canadian lakes. Others reach eight- and nine-digit sums and offer airstrips and prebuilt resorts in turquoise waters in the Caribbean and the South Pacific.

But transporting clients to show them islands is trickier than ever. At one point, Mr. Krolow had a dozen potential buyers ready to see islands in Belize, but the airports were closed. Over the past six months, there had been only a few weeks when you could easily fly in and out of the Caribbean, said Edward de Mallet Morgan, a partner at Knight Frank, a real estate firm in London. It's one thing to buy a house without visiting it first, he said, but ""buying an island is a different thing, particularly if you can't even send your professional advisers to review it for you ahead of time."" The British Virgin Islands have barred tourists until at least December. And even as flights have resumed to the Bahamas, visitors must commit to installing a phone app and quarantining for two weeks. These measures are too much, some clients tell their brokers."
21627,Why 1999 Was Hollywood's Greatest Year,"The cultural critic Brian Raftery makes a strong case in ""Best. Movie. Year. Ever.: How 1999 Blew Up the Big Screen.""","Brad Pitt, center, in &ldquo;Fight Club,&rdquo; directed by David Fincher.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/02/books/review/31friend1/31friend1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=123917399a24eca1dccc3c8c5f608d0e7f0230ef9225d7c79fbf8e833f120b33&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/books/review/hollywoods-greatest-year-brian-raftery.html,ae076deb-5fd0-592f-a89d-6ac5ec0ad5e3.jpg,"BEST. MOVIE. YEAR. EVER. 

How 1999 Blew Up the Big Screen 

By Brian Raftery Cinema's best year ever? For decades, Old Hollywood purists have argued for 1939, which brought us ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Stagecoach,"" ""The Women,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""Dark Victory,"" ""Intermezzo"" and many more. Others plant the flag for 19-seventy-9; lately, the writer Rich Cohen has been churning out essays on Medium in praise of that year's bounty: ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Mad Max,"" ""Being There,"" ""Alien,"" ""All That Jazz"" and comedies such as ""The Jerk,"" ""The In-Laws,"" ""Life of Brian"" and ""Real Life.""

Now comes the culture critic Brian Raftery with ""Best. Movie. Year. Ever.: How 1999 Blew Up the Big Screen."" He focuses on a bumper crop of breakthrough, subversive, auteur-driven movies -- virtually all of which were released theatrically in 1999 -- quoting the actor Edward Norton (of 1999's ""Fight Club""), who is hard pressed to name any other 12-month span ""that had more really original young filmmakers tapping into the zeitgeist.""

Raftery makes a persuasive, entertaining case for the enduring impact of a passel of classics, from ""American Beauty"" to ""American Movie"" to ""American Pie."" Among them: ""The Matrix,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""Three Kings,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""The Best Man,"" ""The Insider,"" ""The Virgin Suicides,"" ""Magnolia"" and ""Election."" He weaves together film history and cheeky anecdotes from Hollywood insiders, recounting a midnight rave here, a nude ski run there. His tone, like the period's, is jaunty but jaundiced. When ""The Matrix"" was conceived, he observes, ""the mainstream web was still in its modem-wheezing early days."" ""Fight Club,"" he contends, had ""the proper alchemy of madcap and menace."" Raftery's voice and thesis suit today's craving for Nineties Nostalgia.

In what the author describes as a cinematic counterinsurgency, many Class of '99 filmmakers -- weaned on TV remotes, joysticks, music videos and the web -- dispensed with linear narratives and incorporated the ""A.D.D.-addled storytelling of modern nonfiction television."" Chronology was crunched in the ecstasy-laced ""Go,"" the micro-budgeted ""Following"" and ""Run Lola Run,"" which played out like a video game. Lana and Lilly Wachowski's ""The Matrix,"" as Raftery sees it, tapped into the idea that ""online, reality was becoming bendable,"" a concept encapsulated in a revolutionary CGI sequence in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) miraculously evades a hurtling bullet. ""'The Matrix,'"" Raftery writes, ""nudged viewers to develop their own slowed-down, omniscient, bullet-time view of the world around them: Who controls my life?"" Indeed, the themes of ""The Matrix,"" including our quest to decipher hidden, alternative realities, still bewitch us. (A few months ago, in fact, New York magazine published ""19 Things 'The Matrix' Predicted About Life in 2019."")

These maverick directors borrowed from hacker and web culture, their films foreshadowing social media's dark descent. The internet colors Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich,"" in which sojourners adopt the actor John Malkovich's body as their avatar. According to Malkovich himself, Charlie Kaufman's script addressed the media-fueled ""need we have ... to lead sort of virtual lives."" This compulsion to recast one's identity was also at the twisted core of 1999's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" as well as ""Man on the Moon,"" in which Jim Carrey essentially transformed himself (on set and off) into the gonzo performance artist-comedian Andy Kaufman. Without the web, there would have been no ""Blair Witch Project,"" the homemade sham-snuff horror movie that became a case study in online promotion. The indie film's faux verite shared the fraudulent authenticity of a new genre, reality TV. And once ""Blair Witch"" went viral, as Raftery puts it, it helped ""fringe fears go mainstream,"" a fright-wig stepchild of Oliver Stone movies and ""The X-Files.""

Many of the movies, Raftery points out, came with a fin de siecle edge: a pervading apocalyptic angst. The story lines, with their aggrieved outsiders and collapsing families, prophesied our current condition, post-9/11 -- plagued as we are by forever wars, increasing wealth disparity and the oppressive rise of the autocrat, the bigot, the corporate state. Frogs rain from the sky in ""Magnolia."" The Burnham household implodes in ""American Beauty."" Sexual obsession and decadence envelop ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Angry young white guys rage against the machine in ""Fight Club,"" whose release was postponed in the wake of the killings at Columbine. ""Boys Don't Cry,"" which recounts the murder of Brandon Teena, a transgender man, was filmed, Raftery says, just as ""Matthew Shepard was kidnapped, pistol-whipped and tied to a fence in ... Wyoming."" For all this, the book has its hiccups. Raftery, despite a nice shout-out to John Hughes, favors '90s kids-in-crisis films over ""crummier Reagan-era teen movies."" There's no mention of ""Quiet: We Live in Public,"" the dystopian social experiment webcammed 24/7 on the eve of the new millennium -- until the cops shut it down. That said, Raftery dares to think bigger than the big screen. He explains that once HBO rolled out ""The Sopranos"" in January 1999, its influence would prove seismic: Thereafter, a generation's most engaging onscreen stories would be serials, viewed in our homes or on our phones. He notes, as well, that in 1999, when AOL began its $165 billion play for the Time Warner colossus, the deal presaged the current Digital Ice Age, in which tech (Netflix, Amazon et al.) is slowly slaying the Hollywood dinosaur. Raftery's right. Nineteen-ninety-nine did rewire how we tell stories in moving pictures. Morpheus, we're not in Kansas anymore. Then again, ""Best. Movie. Year. Ever."" may also be biased, inflating the significance of the cultural touchstones of its author's youth. In that regard, I'd like to speak up for 1968, which turned out ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""The Producers,"" ""Bullitt,"" ""The Lion in Winter,"" ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ..."
1969,"Park Hill, Yonkers, N.Y.: A 'Secret Neighborhood' Overlooking the Bronx","Developed in the 19th century as a retreat for the wealthy, Park Hill is full of contrasts, with a mix of turreted mansions and modest postwar houses.","Overcliff, a turreted Queen Anne-style house on Alta Avenue, was the home of Edwin Martin, the president of the American Real Estate Company, which developed much of the neighborhood.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/12/realestate/12LIVING-PARKHILL-slide-UBBC/12LIVING-PARKHILL-slide-UBBC-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d48cd4d4925c63a25a8098be398879ff1efe155e97b6e2b7c42f0bab456fc1b3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/realestate/park-hill-yonkers-ny-a-secret-neighborhood-overlooking-the-bronx.html,163610dd-ca68-5bcd-98e0-5bb0a9d397ba.jpg,"Park Hill, an upland section of the city of Yonkers whose serpentine roads loop past Victorian gems, is only a few hundred feet from the Bronx, but it can elicit feelings of not being in New York anymore. The land of Oz? Not quite -- although there are yellow bricks peeking out from beneath the asphalt on Overcliff Street.

Previously, the couple rented a loft in the financial district of Manhattan. But Ms. Cardona, who enjoys painting at home, was feeling cramped in her live-create situation. Familiar with Yonkers from a brief stint in a rental more than a decade before, she thought it might have what she was looking for. And it did, in the form of a 1929 red-brick house, with four bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, hardwood floors and an unusual Georgian-meets-Tudor facade, that cost in the ""low $700,000s,"" she said. The house, which the couple shares with their rescue dog, Zaha (as in the late architect Zaha Hadid), has plenty of room to spare, allowing Ms. Cardona to commandeer a bedroom for that long-sought dedicated space for art. The surrounding landscape, which crests at more than 250 feet, can also provide inspiration, as when ice storms leave a glistening sheen on the neighborhood's many mature trees. ""You just want to grab a camera and photograph everything,"" Ms. Cardona said. ""It's really magical."" If the views from above, which sweep across the Hudson River, are heavenly, the reality below can be grittier. The blocks beyond Park Hill's borders are some of the most impoverished in Yonkers, the state's fourth most populous city. The contrasts, between resplendent mansions and ragged multifamily homes, can be stark.

So Mr. Danticat, a business manager for a Manhattan public school, was leery about looking for a home there. ""I thought it would be tough, but maybe even scary for children,"" said Mr. Danticat, who has a son and daughter, and a wife, Mia, a teacher in Manhattan. They were living in a two-family rowhouse in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and were eager to move. After buying the house in 2011, the Danticats watched gentrification spread as developers swallowed up almost every empty lot on their block. The increase in population that followed fueled tension, said Mr. Danticat, who grimly recalled a drawn-out battle with a neighbor over a parking spot. ""Brooklyn just got too small,"" he said. Morris Park, in the Bronx, where they first looked, seemed equally crowded. But Park Hill offered room to breathe and impressive period homes, like the five-bedroom colonial with crown molding and shutter-lined windows that the Danticats bought for $573,000 in 2018. Along the way, Mr. Danticat has become more forgiving of grit. ""It's the whole nature of city life,"" he said, to have great blocks and not-so-great blocks. ""New York is like that, too."" While online maps define Park Hill broadly, many locals -- and the Park Hill Residents' Association, which represents some 600 residents in a neighborhood of about 1,000 houses -- use the narrower boundaries of South Broadway, McLean Avenue, the Saw Mill River Parkway and Spruce Street.

Single-family houses, many constructed between 1890 and 1930, are dominant, and care seems to have been taken to make each one stand apart, with Queen Anne, Mediterranean and Shingle styles alternating. Many structures are angled in distinctive ways toward the street. Turrets are plentiful, many topped with flattened cones, as at 28 Lewis Parkway. And stone is a common flourish, as at 244 Park Hill Avenue, where it surrounds many of the windows. Over the years, buildings have burned down and estates have been carved up, allowing modest ranches and colonials to squeeze in, like those on prized Alta Avenue, helping give Park Hill a socioeconomic mix. Attempts to create historic districts, which could protect older homes, have gone nowhere, said Mary Hoar, a past president of the Yonkers Historical Society, who lives in the four-bedroom Dutch colonial-style house in Park Hill that her parents bought in 1942 for $15,000. Some homeowners expressed concern about replacing expensive slate roofs, Ms. Hoar said, adding, ""The meetings were full of yelling and screaming and carrying on."" But in an enclave that resembles a scaled-down Newport, many renovations seem respectful all the same.

Because many houses in Park Hill stay in families for generations, turnover is limited, and so is inventory. Properties listed on the market earlier this month were fairly typical, brokers said: Twelve houses, from $475,000 to $800,000, were for sale, while 10 others, from $370,000 to $825,000, were in contract. Divining trends from a small sample is difficult. But prices appear steady, even as those in other parts of Westchester County have softened. In 2019, 29 houses sold for an average of $540,000, said Jane McAfee, an associate broker with Houlihan Lawrence, while in 2018, 22 sold for an average of $576,000; in 2017, there were 35 sales, at an average of $534,000. Also appealing, brokers pointed out, is that property taxes can be a third of those for comparable homes in places like neighboring Hastings-on-Hudson. As for rentals, two-bedrooms at 153 Park Hill Avenue, a Tudor-style building that is among the neighborhood's few large multifamily properties, run about $1,800 a month.

Despite being a sylvan summit, Park Hill actually got its name from Robert Parkhill Getty, a New York executive who owned a 25-acre estate on South Broadway. In 1888, Getty sold the land to Andrew S. Brownell, a founder of the American Real Estate Company, which sought to create an A-lister getaway. Trains would carry visitors to a station on what is now known as Undercliff Street. Passengers would then hop on a funicular railway that would whisk them upward. The funicular's two station buildings have survived: One, a stone-and-stucco structure at 32 Undercliff, contains apartments; the other, at 83 Alta, is a child-care facility.

11555,Gross Domestic Misery Is Rising,The recovery is bypassing those who need it most.,"People lined up outside a Kentucky career center for assistance with their unemployment claims in Frankfort, Ky., in June.&nbsp;",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/07/opinion/07Krugman/merlin_176518893_18b2743f-613a-4401-98d5-8cd50f8781eb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cfe7c8fa8d7d22830e6d4733a774c6950f2b9d40bf9630a2115040d7b115c031&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/opinion/trump-economy-jobs.html,7747c77a-ad78-5fa0-90fe-ffa04562e459.jpg,"Are you better off now than you were in July? On the face of it, that shouldn't even be a question. After all, stocks are up; the economy added more than a million jobs in ""August"" (I'll explain the scare quotes in a minute); preliminary estimates suggest that G.D.P. is growing rapidly in the third quarter, which ends this month. But the stock market isn't the economy: more than half of all stocks are owned by only 1 percent of Americans, while the bottom half of the population owns only 0.7 percent of the market. Jobs and G.D.P., by contrast, sort of are the economy. But they aren't the economy's point. What some economists and many politicians often forget is that economics isn't fundamentally about data, it's about people. I like data as much as, or probably more than, the next guy. But an economy's success should be judged not by impersonal statistics, but by whether people's lives are getting better. And the simple fact is that over the past few weeks the lives of many Americans have gotten much worse.

Obviously this is true for the roughly 30,000 Americans who died of Covid-19 in August -- for comparison, only 4,000 people died in the European Union, which has a larger population -- plus the unknown but large number of our citizens who suffered long-term health damage. And don't look now, but the number of new coronavirus cases, which had been declining, seems to have plateaued; between Labor Day and school re-openings, there's a pretty good chance that the virus situation is about to take another turn for the worse. But things have already gotten worse for millions of families that lost most of their normal income as a result of the pandemic and still haven't gotten it back. For the first few months of the pandemic depression many of these Americans were getting by thanks to emergency federal aid. But much of that aid was cut off at the end of July, and despite job gains we're in the midst of a huge increase in national misery. So let's talk about that employment report. One important thing to bear in mind about official monthly job statistics is that they're based on surveys conducted during the second week of the month. That's why I used scare quotes around ""August"": What Friday's report actually gave us was a snapshot of the state of the labor market around Aug. 12. This may be important. Private data suggest a slowdown in job growth since late July. So the next employment report, which will be based on data collected this week -- and will also be the last report before the election -- will probably (not certainly) be weaker than the last. In any case, that August report wasn't great considering the context. In normal times a gain of 1.4 million jobs would be impressive, even if some of those jobs were a temporary blip associated with the census. But we're still more than 11 million jobs down from where we were in February.

And the situation remains dire for the hardest-hit workers. The pandemic slump disproportionately hit workers in the leisure and hospitality sector -- think restaurants -- and employment in that sector is still down around 25 percent, while the unemployment rate for workers in the industry is still over 20 percent, more than four times what it was a year ago. In part because of where the slump was concentrated, the unemployed tend to be Americans who were earning low wages even before the slump. And one disturbing fact about the August report was that average wages rose. No, that's not a misprint: If the low-wage workers hit worst by the slump were being rehired, we'd expect average wages to fall, as they did during the snapback of May and June. Rising average wages at this point are a sign that those who really need jobs aren't getting them. So the economy is still bypassing those who need a recovery most. Yet most of the safety net that temporarily sustained the economic victims of the coronavirus has been torn down. The CARES Act, enacted in March, gave the unemployed an extra $600 a week in benefits. This supplement played a crucial role in limiting extreme hardship; poverty may even have gone down. But the supplement ended on July 31, and all indications are that Republicans in the Senate will do nothing to restore aid before the election. President Trump's attempt to implement a $300 per week supplement by executive action will fail to reach many and prove inadequate even for those who get it. Families may have scraped by for a few weeks on saved money, but things are about to get very hard for millions. The bottom line here is that before you cite economic statistics, you want to think about what they mean for people and their lives. The data aren't meaningless: A million jobs gained is better than a million jobs lost, and growing G.D.P. is better than shrinking G.D.P. But there is often a disconnect between the headline numbers and the reality of American life, and that is especially true right now. The fact is that this economy just isn't working for many Americans, who are facing hard times that -- thanks to political decisions by Trump and his allies -- are just getting harder.

As part of DoublePlus, a series in which lesser-known choreographers are selected by their more experienced peers, Gibney Dance continued that nurturing spirit on Thursday at the Agnes Varis Performing Arts Center with a split bill programmed by Jon Kinzel and featuring Stuart Shugg and Anna Azrieli.

At the start of ""Dear Washing Machine, Long Night,"" Mr. Shugg, a lucid dancer with scrupulous technique, contrasts precision with weight and weightlessness. The first to take the stage, he holds his arms straight but loose enough to swing, and tips his torso forward and back. As he skims along the surface of momentum, all the while a picture of serenity and meticulous footwork, he tightens a hand into a fist and presses his knuckles on the floor. Leaning on it, he performs a leapfrog jump.

Mr. Shugg has taken a lot from Trisha Brown, with whom he dances. After Hadar Ahuvia and T. J. Spaur join in, the pendulum motion of the movement loses its urgency, and it's increasingly hard to know what Mr. Shugg has to say for himself. Apart from some promising moments in which the dancers explore their body weight by leaning onto one another's arms, ""Dear Washing Machine"" never really evolves.

In ""Averaging,"" Ms. Azrieli explores the familiar or the humdrum, which to her means an arabesque penchee, in which a dancer extends a leg and leans forward. That comes later in this sultry dance. At first, she mirrors Talya Epstein in a sequence of full-bodied undulations as three others -- Evvie Allison, Megan Kendzior and Katy Telfer, wearing Connor Voss's winning terry-cloth dresses -- wind their way around the stage."
18343,Michael Cohen's Testimony Grabs Late-Night TV's Attention,"All the late-night shows broadcasting on Wednesday focused on Cohen's revealing, often startling congressional testimony about President Trump, his former client.","Seth Meyers poked fun at their meeting in Vietnam, Kim Jong-un told President Trump: ""Quiet!

If you're interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. The testimony of Michael Cohen, President Trump's former lawyer, before a House committee on Wednesday was almost the only thing the late-night TV hosts could talk about. In his willingness to lay blame directly at Mr. Trump's feet, and to categorically denounce the president as a ""racist"" and a ""con man,"" Cohen delivered a wealth of head-turning sound bites, and the hosts pounced on them. ""Cohen went in front of Congress and called Trump a con man and a cheat. And then he followed it up by saying, [tearily] 'He taught me everything I know!'"" -- JIMMY FALLON

Seth Meyers poked fun at Republican members of Congress who spent the hearing attacking Cohen's credibility. ""Republican Representative Jim Jordan claimed today that Michael Cohen is only speaking out against President Trump because he is upset he was not given a job in the White House. Because everyone knows that getting a job in the White House can be a solid source of income -- for weeks."" -- SETH MEYERS And Conan O'Brien lamented that there was no escaping images, sound bites and clips from the hearings. ""That's been on TV all day long. I got up this morning, it was on, I was watching it with my kids. They were like, 'Daddy, what's hush money?' I was like, 'I'll pay you $20 if you never ask me that again.'"" -- CONAN O'BRIEN ""At the very end of the hearing, Michael Cohen said he hopes his testimony 'heals America.' That's what he said. Yeah, not only is Michael Cohen a bad lawyer, he's a terrible doctor. He thought a day of this would heal us!"" -- CONAN O'BRIEN

Lady Gaga appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" and the host couldn't help asking about her performance of the song ""Shallow"" at the Oscars on Sunday alongside her co-star and director in ""A Star Is Born,"" Bradley Cooper. Kimmel spoke for many a Twitter user when he said the intimacy of the performance made it seem as if Gaga and Cooper might have a real-life romantic interest. Gaga said those questions felt like an artistic compliment. ""Yes, people saw love, and guess what: That's what we wanted you to see,"" Gaga said, while attacking social media as ""the toilet of the internet.""

Later, she added gleefully: ""I'm an artist, and I guess we did a good job, and -- fooled ya!"" Trump's summit meeting in Vietnam on Wednesday with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was vastly overshadowed by the Cohen hearing. Meyers hardly mentioned the diplomatic talks, and when he did, it was only to point out how much less absorbing they were than Cohen's statements. ""He just listed off a bunch of alleged crimes committed by the president on national TV. And you know it's so ironic: Trump finally went to Vietnam, and he's gettin' killed back home."" -- SETH MEYERS ""President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un began their summit in Vietnam today, where Trump referred to Kim as his friend, and Kim said to Trump, 'Quiet! I'm watching the Michael Cohen testimony.'"" -- SETH MEYERS Fallon Gets Into the Analysis Business

The focus on the Cohen hearing became so consuming that Jimmy Fallon decided to end his monologue early and sit down with Katy Tur, a Washington journalist and author. Fallon rarely gets into the nitty-gritty of politics like this, let alone before a commercial break. ""It was huge,"" Tur said of Cohen's statement, comparing it to that of John Dean, who turned on President Richard Nixon during the Watergate hearings. ""This is a guy that I would talk to on the campaign all the time,"" Tur said of Cohen. ""It did not matter at all what was going on: Donald Trump was being accused of racism, the Access Hollywood tape -- it didn't matter. Michael Cohen would always defend him. And now he's coming out and he's saying, 'I lied for Trump, and Trump may have committed a felony while he was president.'"" O'Brien took a more personal look at the Republican members of Congress who asked questions of Cohen on Wednesday."

Among the automakers, Honda has had the most serious, continuing problem with air bags. Before Thursday's action, Honda had already recalled almost two million vehicles since 2008 for an excessively powerful driver's air bag.

Honda said on Thursday that it was not aware of any injuries related to the defect, which involves the inflaters on passenger-side air bags. But late in 2011, Honda acknowledged 18 injuries and two deaths linked to a recall of two million vehicles because of the problem with the driver's air bag."

MADRID -- Rosalia Efigenia Guaman, one of 540,000 Ecuadorean emigrants living in Spain, jumped on the news that the biggest privately owned bank in Ecuador, Banco Pichincha, had also moved here. Rekindling her relationship with the bank she had used back home allowed Ms. Guaman, a housekeeper and waitress, to lower the cost of her remittances, she said, as well as to buy a life insurance policy. ""I feel very reassured to know that it will be much easier for my mother in Ecuador to get back everything possible if anything goes really wrong for me here,"" she said. Pichincha received its Spanish commercial banking license in spring 2010, just as Greece became the first euro zone member to seek a bailout, setting off a sovereign debt crisis that has also left Spain and its banking sector reeling. Since then, the bank's Spanish unit has grown beyond the expectations of its own management by pulling off a trick that companies the world over seek to perform: selling familiarity to a loyal, nearly captive clientele far from home.

Its timing also proved fortunate, as Spanish banks that had previously sought to attract Latin American migrants started to pull back from this line of business as the euro zone's financial crisis put pressure on them to cut noncore activities. ""The crisis has meant that our competition simply vacated the space that was our obvious target, in terms of clients,"" said Jorge Ignacio Marchan Riera, who is the head of Pichincha's operations in Spain. Mr. Marchan said his bank would make a profit this year on its Spanish business, two years ahead of schedule. Assets under management in Spain are expected to double, after having reached 63 million euros ($84 million) at the end of 2011, up from 27 million euros a year earlier. And while most Spanish banks are downsizing their consumer networks, Mr. Marchan wants ""at least"" 20 branches across Spain by the end of the year, up from 12 at present. Still, it may be too early to call Pichincha more than a small and timely success story in an otherwise bleak banking landscape. ""Pichincha is doing well partly because it comes from zero and so doesn't carry the heavy load of bad loans that banks here have accumulated,"" said Javier Santoma, professor of financial management at IESE, a Spanish business school. ""The real test for any bank, however, always comes, not when it lends, but when it eventually tries to get its money back.""

Banking to migrants, however, looks promising. Migration worldwide is expected to continue rising, which in turn should benefit Pichincha and other institutions from developing countries that have expanded overseas to cater to migrants who send part of their earnings home. Last year, remittance flows to developing countries rose 8 percent, to $351 billion. They are likely to reach $441 billion by 2014, according to a report published in December by the World Bank.

The World Bank noted that remittance outflows from Spain had remained ""fairly resilient"" and grew 15 percent in the first half of last year as ""migrants have cut into savings and even consumption in order to send remittances, and perhaps to prepare for an eventual return."" Yet so far, and despite Spain's struggling with a jobless rate of almost 23 percent, only a few thousand Ecuadoreans have packed their bags to go back home. Senami, Ecuador's national migration secretariat, said that in the second half of last year, 2,794 registered Ecuadoreans had sought information on how to benefit from a state-sponsored assistance program to return home from Spain. According to Spain's immigration statistics, the number of registered Ecuadoreans fell by about 35,000 in the last two years, but that figure includes those who, like Ms. Guaman, acquired Spanish citizenship. While the United States dwarfs other countries as a destination for Latin American emigrants, Spain comes second, receiving about one in 10 Latin American migrants each year, according to the World Bank. Over all, Spain registered about five million migrants in a decade, now equivalent to 12 percent of its population. Ecuadoreans form the largest Latin American community in Spain, spearheading migration to the country after a devastating economic crisis in 1999 that led to a 70 percent depreciation of Ecuador's currency, the sucre, and a default on its external debt. The crisis occurred just as Spain's construction-led boom was getting under way.

The newcomers from Latin America did not go unnoticed among Spanish banks that then had the liquidity to extend credit. Before applying for its own banking license, Pichincha discussed forming an alliance with Banco Popular, one of the biggest Spanish institutions. In 2006, Popular started MundoCredit, a subsidiary with 60 branches, aimed at migrants and their soaring remittances. Money outflows from Spain rose almost fivefold from 2001 to 2007, reaching $15.2 billion in that year, according to the World Bank. But the negotiations between Popular and Pichincha stalled, and last year Popular shut MundoCredit as a stand-alone entity, following in the footsteps of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, or BBVA, which also closed down a similar business called Dinero Express. Behind such closures, ""the logical thinking is that you are dealing with clients whose track record is hard to establish and who are in the front line in terms of job vulnerability,"" said Emilio Ontiveros, chairman of Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a research consulting firm in Madrid. In the meantime, however, Santander and BBVA, the two biggest commercial banks in Spain, expanded aggressively into Latin America to offset weakening domestic revenue. Net earnings at both banks fell 35 percent last year. While a booming Brazilian business helped cushion the fall for Santander, Mexico overtook Spain as the market contributing most to BBVA's earnings. Pichincha has managed to pick up clients by not charging for remittances to Ecuador or to other countries, like Peru and Colombia, where Pichincha operates. In addition, the bank has been expanding its microcredit business in Spain, as well as setting lower thresholds for clients to earn interest on their deposits -- currently 3.5 percent a year on an account as small as 600 euros ($802). The cultural affinity, meanwhile, is strengthened by Latin Americans' accounting for four-fifths of the bank's employees in Spain. On the other hand, shifting money from Ecuador to Spain remains complicated and costly because the bank ""is simply not as integrated on an operational level as might seem,"" said Manuel Romera, director of the financial sector of the IE business school, who helped a small Ecuadorean company with such a transfer. Pichincha's other -- and arguably riskier -- expansion strategy has involved buying assets from Spanish institutions that need to lift their capital ratios to comply with new banking rules. Last year, for instance, Pichincha paid 5.5 million euros for a Latin American consumer credit portfolio from Bankia, one of Spain's biggest savings banks. Such purchased assets have contained on average 9 percent of bad or doubtful loans, thereby raising the overall level held by Pichincha in Spain to 7 percent. That percentage, however, remains below the 7.7 percent average for the Spanish banking sector."

Farhad: Hello, Michael. Boy, this was another relaxing week in newsland, wasn't it? I just wish something would happen. The world has gotten so boring and predictable. I'm falling asleep. Mike: I'm too tired, shellshocked and busy looking into the Times's insurance policies around therapists who treat news PTSD to acknowledge your sarcasm right now. Farhad: O.K., let's run through what happened in tech this week. As usual, there was a lot of Trump-related stuff, but let's start with a few items that had nothing at all to do with our new president.

Here's Snap's problem. Part of what made companies like Facebook so successful is this economic term and Silicon Valley buzzphrase: network effects. Essentially, the larger a network gets, the more people tend to find value in it. Facebook is the classic example of positive network effects strengthening the site over time. Snapchat has a bit more difficult time doing that. It doesn't have a follower model similar to Facebook's, which means it takes a bit more effort to find new or interesting people to interact with on Snapchat. Also, content posted by people who aren't your friends isn't easily discoverable, another issue of keeping people engaged, in my mind. A lot of folks compare Snapchat to Twitter, which I think is a pretty apt way of looking at it. Both companies really rely on brand advertising -- basically, high-dollar accounts from huge advertisers rather than a bunch of smaller accounts that make up the long tail of revenue -- and that seems to pale in comparison to the advertisers that go with, say, Google or Facebook. And, as Facebook will tell you all day long, advertisers love targeting data, which Facebook has in droves. Snapchat, less so.

Farhad: Let's turn to Trump. The tech industry continued to be roiled by clashes with the new administration. The war expanded to a number of fronts. First, there was immigration. Lots of tech workers protested President Trump's executive order banning travel from a number of Muslim-majority countries. Employees at Google staged a walkout this week, not in opposition to the company's management but sanctioned by it. Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder, and Sundar Pichai, its C.E.O., who are both immigrants, spoke out in support of the protesters. And even though some of them initially dragged their feet, by early in the week just about every other tech leader had come out in strong opposition to the immigration ban.

This is moving much faster than I thought it would. I'm not surprised Silicon Valley is a liberal bastion; I am surprised that workers here reacted so strongly to the new order. Were you? And where do you think this goes? Mike: Honestly, I wasn't shocked. It seemed like a national backlash, and people mobilized almost immediately. Besides being quite liberal, tech has many, many workers here from Asia and the Middle East and this directly affects them and their families. I would have been surprised if they had all stayed quiet. I do think the Uber phenomenon around this was interesting. Almost overnight, Uber became the target for outrage, as people were upset at the continued willingness of Uber's chief, Travis Kalanick, to be on Trump's economic council. As hundreds of thousands of people deleted their Uber accounts and employees internally voiced concerns, Travis stepped down from the council. And to your earlier point, the speed of how people mobilized so quickly was indeed breathtaking. I think a lot of it had to do with a feeling of helplessness among people that I heard about quite a bit. They wanted to do something, hence the protests, but also deleting and boycotting Uber felt satisfying to many, like they were taking a stand. We'll see if that blows over now that Travis is off the council. Farhad: On the other hand, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief, decided that he's not quitting the Trump advisory council. In a statement, Musk said he didn't like the immigration order, but that he'd use his position on the council to suggest changes to the policy. The funny thing, though, is that Musk already seems to be limiting his ambitions. He suggested on Twitter this week that he didn't think he could press Trump to retract the order. That ship had sailed! But yes, this is still a man who wants to colonize Mars. Guess some things are easier than others. Mike: Sending a man to Mars is more feasible than changing Donald Trump's stance on immigration. This is the part where I would normally use the thinking face emoji if we were texting each other."

New Type of Test May Better Discern Immunity to the Coronavirus

A new type of test can detect a person's immune response to the coronavirus better than a widely used antibody test, according to research released on Tuesday. The test, if authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, would be the first commercial product to detect the response of a T cell -- a type of immune cell -- to the virus. Antibodies have dominated the conversation on immunity since the start of the pandemic, but scientists believe that T cells may be just as important in preventing reinfection. The test was developed by Adaptive Biotechnologies, a company based in Seattle. The company used small blood samples from 1,000 people across 25 metropolitan areas in the United States as well as another 3,500 participants from Europe to create the test, which can detect a recent or past infection of the coronavirus. The company's data has not yet been reviewed for publication in a scientific journal, but experts say the work is promising for assessing T cells' role in the illness caused by the coronavirus.

Exposure to a pathogen rouses multiple arms of the immune system: antibodies, but also immune cells that can marshal the fight against the intruder. ""What we're developing is essentially a way to look at that cellular part of immunity,"" said Dr. Lance Baldo, chief medical officer of Adaptive Biotechnologies. Antibodies have so far hogged much of the attention -- mostly because testing for them is quick and easy. But levels of antibodies tend to wane after the active illness is resolved and may be undetectable within a few months. Read More on the Coronavirus Pandemic

* None Updated Boosters: New findings show that Pfizer's updated booster New findings show that Pfizer's updated booster is better than its predecessor at increasing the antibody levels of people over age 55 against the most common version of the virus now circulating.
* None Personality Changes: New research suggests that Covid's disruption of social rituals and rites of passage have made people New research suggests that Covid's disruption of social rituals and rites of passage have made people less extroverted, creative, agreeable and conscientious Several studies have suggested that T cells that remember the virus persist for at least six months. ""There's a growing realization that T cells are important and may even be a better indicator of clinical outcome"" than antibodies, said Alessandro Sette, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. But isolating T cells is an elaborate and onerous process, severely limiting the information about their role.

Each of the trillions of T cells present at birth carries a unique receptor on its surface that can spot a different molecule, or antigen, from potential invaders. This enormous diversity among T-cell receptors enables the human body to recognize virtually any new pathogen that it may encounter (although a vast majority may never meet their match.) But it also makes it painfully onerous for scientists to identify the 20 or 30 T cells among the trillions that can recognize fragments of a specific pathogen like the coronavirus. ""One of the brutal things about immunology is that all white blood cells look the same,"" said Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. ""You can't even tell B cells from T cells, let alone T cells specific to a virus."" 

 To find the T cells specific to a virus, researchers must first separate the bulk of immune cells from a few milliliters of blood, which takes time. Then they wash and count the cells, and stimulate them with pieces of the virus to identify the tiny pool of T cells that respond. The cells that are activated release a molecule called gamma interferon that serves as a signal of their activity. ""The better the assay, the more complicated it is,"" Dr. Crotty said. ""You get more and more information, but it becomes more and more complicated."" A single researcher can process no more than five blood samples over the course of a day and a half. ""That's pretty much why every single paper that is done on T cells, the number of subjects that are studied is never higher than 100,"" said Dr. Antonio Bertoletti, a virologist at Duke NUS Medical School in Singapore. ""There has also never been great demand for wading into the intricacies of T cell tests.""

Adaptive Biotechnologies has a completely different approach: Instead of looking at the cells, the company focused on sequencing the proteins on the cells' surface. Every person has a different repertoire of the trillions of T cell receptors, known as TCRs. But at least some of those TCRs are identical to those in other people. ""We call those public T cell receptor sequences, because, theoretically, many people across the population will elicit those responses,"" Dr. Baldo said. When the pandemic started, Adaptive Technologies had already been working with Microsoft to design a TCR-based diagnostic test for Lyme disease, a project made possible by the advent of fast and inexpensive sequencing technologies. Pivoting to the coronavirus, the team identified 135,000 public TCRs that recognize 545 fragments of the virus. About 11 of these 545 antigens elicit the largest immune response, the researchers reported in September. (Only one of these antigens, the spike protein, is being used to develop vaccines.) In the new work, the team analyzed samples from 2,200 people in Vo, Italy, which tested all 2,900 of its residents for presence of the coronavirus in March, when cases were soaring there. The researchers' test, called the T-Detect, correctly identified 97 percent of those who had a confirmed diagnosis, compared with 77 percent from a commercial antibody test called DiaSorin. The results are freely available in a database called ImmuneCode. The company is creating a lab-based test for the general public that can diagnose prior infection, as well as a sophisticated version for vaccine companies interested in tracking T cell responses to their candidates.

Experts not involved in the work praised the company's innovative approach, but said they wanted to see evidence that the test was specific to the coronavirus. ""There isn't a consensus out there now that you can take TCRs from one person that are specific for a given person and tell that another person is infected with the virus in a consistent way,"" Dr. Crotty said. ""If they've figured out a way to do that that's awesome, but it's pretty novel."" A commercial test also would not offer people information beyond evidence of past infection, cautioned Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale. But if the test is specific to the new coronavirus, she said, ""it will give us a much more sensitive way of measuring whether a person has been exposed."" The test may also offer insights into Covid-19. And about 5 percent of patients who are severely ill show a ""tremendous drop"" in their T cell response, Dr. Baldo said. But in a vast majority of people, the T cell response seems to peak around Day 10 and persists for many months, he said, adding: ""We're seeing an earlier, a more robust and even a more durable T cell response as opposed to the antibody response."""

Good advice! Industry dinners run long, and the fashion industry's, patina of glamour notwithstanding, are no different. After guests were herded to their tables at the Brooklyn Museum, where the CFDA awards were being held for the first time (Ms. von Furstenberg ""feels like Brooklyn's time has come,"" said the museum's director, Anne Pasternak), dinner was followed by an aimless hour of kibitzing and waiting. Models milled; Juuls were discreetly sucked. Bottles of tequila sat on every table, with limes at the ready, and were restocked before they were even empty. In the spirit of merrymaking, Russell Westbrook, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid and her brother, Anwar, gamely took shots.

But then she appeared: Issa Rae, the evening's host, in a lime green pantsuit. Ms. Rae brought a charge that the mugging hosts of years past -- mostly white male comedians operating at a very comfortable distance from the industry -- have lacked. Ms. Rae claimed she herself was far from fashion, and she opened with a montage of photos of her younger self in outfits less stylish than the one she was wearing. ""When left to my own devices,"" she said from the stage, ""I'm about as fashionable as Kanye is black."" Kim Kardashian West, Kanye's wife, sat front and center, waiting to receive the inaugural Influencer Award. Ms. Rae pressed on, with a set that touched on diversity and inclusion, a theme several winners and honorees would return to throughout the night.

""I'm also the first person of color to ever host the CFDAs,"" Ms. Rae said. ""Which is crazy, especially considering the impact black culture has had on fashion. We've gone from having white designers study black culture to make black clothes for white people that are too expensive for black people to buy, to Virgil Abloh, the first African-American artistic director of Louis Vuitton. ""Now you've got a black man bringing black culture to a historically white fashion house and making clothes too expensive for everybody to buy."" With that, we were off. Ms. Rae passed the mic to Oprah Winfrey, who presented the Media Award to Edward Enninful, the first black editor of British Vogue. (""He has a bold vision,"" Ms. Winfrey said. ""He is a bodacious man."") ""Growing up in West London, I never knew it was possible to achieve something like this,"" Mr. Enninful said. ""And I'm not done yet."" He spoke of the importance of diversity and his commitment to changing the industry for the better.

There was a stirring tribute to Ralph Lauren, a ""CFDA Members Salute"": As Ms. von Furstenberg noted, he had already won more or less all of the available awards, so a new one had to be created for the occasion. She herself then won an award for positive change in the industry, sponsored by Swarovski, which had bedazzled not only a faux Calder in the museum's atrium, but also pairs of cherries and tangerines in the otherwise edible on-table fruit bowls. ""I said, 'I can't accept this -- people are going to think I'm nuts!'"" she said of the back story. ""I had nothing to do with this."" Then she accepted it. A few new winners did appear, most notably James Jebbia, the typically terse founder of Supreme, which won for Men's Wear Designer of the Year despite, as he said in his acceptance speech, the fact that ""I've never considered Supreme to be a fashion company or myself a designer."" (He was appreciative nevertheless.) Sander Lak, the designer of Sies Marjan, won the Swarovski Award for Emerging Talent. The social media moment of the night was likely when Ms. Kardashian West ascended to accept the new Influencer award, ""kind of shocked,"" she said, to be ""getting a fashion award when I'm naked most of the time."" But she was brief and the moment muted. More moving was Naomi Campbell's win for Fashion Icon, as she stood onstage, wiping away tears.

What was there to say after that? All that was left was for Raf Simons of Calvin Klein to collect his Women's Wear Designer of the Year award, the final trophy of the night, a surprise second consecutive win for which he hadn't prepared a speech. ""To all of you real fashion lovers: love fashion!"" he commanded. ""That's what keeps us going. Thank you, women!"" ""Thank you, women!"" she said. ""Shout out to women!"""

But in the best cases they offer a chance to find potently timely surprises in works that seemed to live only in one era. (Without revivals, you can't have classics.) And new plays that revisit the recent past can offer a similar shift in perspective. This month, a few of each stand out.

Shaw's ""St. Joan,"" last seen on Broadway in a becalmed production starring Condola Rashad, has become the dominant dramatic treatment of the Joan of Arc story despite many attempts to upstage it. Case in point: The Public Theater's 2017 production of David Byrne's misbegotten rock oratorio called ""Joan of Arc: Into the Fire."" Turned out, it wasn't such a good idea to focus on the story's gender politics, mostly from a male point of view.

This month, the Public offers (through Dec. 23) what may prove a corrective with ""Mother of the Maid,"" a play by Jane Anderson that had its premiere in 2015 at Shakespeare and Company in Lenox, Mass. Ms. Anderson's version smartly shifts the usual perspective, focusing on the relationship between the problematic teenager and her put-upon mother.

In Lenox, that mother was played by the estimable Tina Packer, who I thought would prove irreplaceable in the role. Enter Glenn Close. Having garnered raves this summer as the title character in ""The Wife,"" for which Ms. Anderson wrote the screenplay, she now switches gears from long-suffering spouse to long-suffering parent. Matthew Penn directs."
51892,Review: Paul Taylor's 'Tracer' Recalls a Dance and an Artist,"This work, performed by the Taylor 2 company, was part of a bill at the 92nd Street Y and brought to mind Mr. Taylor's association with the artist Robert Rauschenberg.","Lee Duveneck and Rei Akazawa of Taylor 2 in ""Tracer,"" at the 92nd Street Y.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/19/arts/19TAYLOR1/19TAYLOR1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3850129b854229af8b7013027eda29679b44b21ff0794fed5f566e2a69e67f53&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/18/arts/dance/paul-taylor-robert-rauschenberg-review.html,65d5ba06-2650-5f56-aa20-713d21e5bdb2.jpg,"The choreographer Paul Taylor, who is preparing his next premiere for March, has been making dances since 1954. But there's one curious divide within his output, too little discussed. Between 1954 and 1962, he made a series of 17 works with designs by the artist Robert Rauschenberg; the last of these was ""Tracer."" The next work he made, ""Aureole,"" also from 1962, was the first one that made Mr. Taylor a big choreographic name and audience hit. This responded to its Handel music with a lyrical happiness that went against the modernist grain of American modern dance at that time; and its musical danciness has characterized much of Mr. Taylor's style ever since. But the popularity it brought him (it was soon being danced by Rudolf Nureyev and ballet companies) lastingly alienated him from Rauschenberg; from John Cage (who had dedicated a piece of music to him); and from others in their circle, some of whom are still alive. All these early stages of the Taylor trajectory were -- marvelously -- evident in a quadruple bill presented by his studio company, Taylor 2, on Friday through Sunday at the 92nd Street Y. Here was early Taylor, with works from 1956 to 1962, among them two pieces designed by Rauschenberg (""3 Epitaphs"" and ""Tracer"") and then ""Aureole."" The contrast between those 1962 works, ""Tracer"" and ""Aureole,"" remains striking.

Does it matter now that these artists fell out then? Rauschenberg and Cage achieved fame within a very few years anyway (and fell out with each other). But it seemed to some, as it still does to some today, that Mr. Taylor had compromised -- that popularity is what he had decided to court -- whereas Rauschenberg & Company bided their time, uncompromisingly, till acclaim came their way. Others, however, were and are able to love both the popularly entertaining and the disquietingly avant-garde aspects of Mr. Taylor.

The program's big historical event was the revival of ""Tracer,"" the last of the Taylor-Rauschenberg collaborations, unseen onstage since 1964 and, after no more than 10 performances back then, remembered by few. Its reconstruction by the dance scholar Kim Jones, assisted by Thomas Patrick and other former Taylor dancers, has involved instinct and imagination as well as research; but Mr. Taylor has given it his approval, letting it stand as part of his history. It first reached the stage on Sept. 30 at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. You have to smile about its Rauschenberg decor: It consists of an upended bicycle wheel, which spins by remote control now and then. This is Rauschenberg acting as an heir to Marcel Duchamp, creator of the early ready-made ""Bicycle Wheel"" in 1913, showing the anti-utilitarian aspects of the quotidian. Wheels became a Rauschenberg motif. (I assume he was also joking about originality: ""Have I invented the wheel?"") ""Tracer"" opens with one dancer curled in a ball beside the wheel, but almost all the movement that follows carries on regardless of it. It's an austere and experimental piece. Because that wheel is attributed to Rauschenberg, it became the most valuable element of ""Tracer"" -- and until this reconstruction, almost the only part to survive. A few years ago, Mr. Taylor sold the original for $437,000, to endow his new American Modern Dance endeavor. Taylor 2 uses instead a super-right replica by Jeff Crawford. The Rauschenberg costumes -- patterned tights -- were rediscovered by Ms. Jones and are the basis for those worn here. The score (played here on tape) is by James Tenney. The cast consists of one man (Lee Duveneck) and three women (Alana Allende, Rei Akazawa, Amanda Stevenson), who dance all four pieces. They make an admirable case for ""Tracer""; I hope this revival has a longer life. They show how uncompromising the ""Tracer"" choreography still is -- poses and movement sometimes alternate -- and how Mr. Taylor was deliberately trying different ways both of responding to music and showing independence from it. Some images prefigure later Taylor choreography, as in the way the man cradles one woman in his arms. A pattern for the three women, hopping around one another in a figure of eight, already shows Mr. Taylor's felicity of design.

Watching ""Tracer"" and ""Aureole"" in quick succession -- they formed this program's second half -- was to feel both sides of the old argument. The breezy charm and singing musicality of ""Aureole"" are a real change of tack, but all the older works here show Mr. Taylor's steady investigation of choreographic musicality. ""Junction,"" made to Bach in 1961 and the immediate predecessor to ""Tracer,"" has been revived in recent years; like ""3 Epitaphs,"" it points to several directions that Mr. Taylor was to take. During Friday's performance, you could see all six young Taylor 2 dancers come into bloom. Mr. Duveneck, stern and powerfully built, dancing Mr. Taylor's own roles, grew steadily sweeter and more powerful. In ""Aureole,"" his alternation between sculptural firmness and ardent plasticity was wonderful to behold. Borne by the music, he seems to be discovering new zones of himself."

Millions of them live in New York, and billions more in cities and on farms across the globe. And wherever they scurry, they wreak havoc. They devour food supplies and contaminate what they don't eat with feces and urine. They spread a range of harmful viruses and bacteria. In delicate ecosystems around the world, they threaten other species with extinction. ""They'll gnaw through walls. They'll gnaw through wires. They'll destroy cars,"" said Jason Munshi-South, a biologist at Fordham University. ""They've managed to spread wherever there are humans."" Despite their ubiquity, Rattus norvegicus, otherwise known as the brown rat, remains surprisingly mysterious. Scientists have only a hazy idea of how it went from wild rodent to unwanted human companion.

Now Dr. Munshi-South and his colleagues have completed the first in-depth genetic study of brown rats from around the world. Their story has twists and turns that surprise even the experts. After spreading slowly for thousands of years, the scientists found, brown rats scampered over much of the planet in just the past three centuries. And once brown rats settle into a new city, the new study suggests, they repel all newcomers -- a finding that could have big implications for our health.

Dr. Munshi-South said the study emerged from a simple question: ""What is a New York City rat, and where did it come from?"" He contacted researchers around the world to see if he could obtain DNA to compare with that of the rats he captures around New York City. To his surprise, he ended up with samples from hundreds of brown rats, from the Galapagos Islands to Brazil, from New Zealand to Japan.

Instead of simply asking where New York City's brown rats came from, Dr. Munshi-South realized he might be able to figure out where the world's brown rats came from. Emily E. Puckett, a postdoctoral researcher in his lab, analyzed the DNA samples, sorting 314 brown rats from 30 countries into clusters of genetic relatives. Eventually, she was able to determine how different populations of the rats mixed together over time. Dr. Puckett, Dr. Munshi-South and their colleagues published their findings last week in Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences. The brown rat is sometimes called the Norway rat, but the new research confirms that the name is a misnomer. Instead, brown rats originated in northern China or Mongolia. Before they became our companions, they fed on wild plants and small animals on cold, open plains. Farming came relatively late to northern China, but at some point, native brown rats, finding a reliable food supply in their midst, switched to living on farms and in villages. Dr. Puckett and her colleagues can't say how long brown rats remained in northern China, but at some point, they started to expand their range. Their first migration, the study suggests, took them to southeastern Asia.

Much later, a wave of brown rats spread northeast, into Japan and Siberia. Another emigrated west, eventually reaching Europe in what appear to have been three major arrivals on the Continent. These rats may have traveled on overland routes, or perhaps hidden on ships that sailed along the coasts of Asia and Europe. The new study suggests that brown rats were slower to spread around the globe than our other familiars, the black rat and the house mouse. Geography may be the reason: House mice originated in the Fertile Crescent, and black rats in India. Farming societies and widespread trade arose in those places much earlier than in northern China, giving the black rat and the house mouse early opportunities to travel. But in the past three centuries, the brown rat has more than made up for lost time. Brown rats in Alaska and along the Pacific Coast of the United States and Canada can trace much of their ancestry to Russia, Dr. Puckett and her colleagues found. Their ancestors may have stowed away aboard ships that traveled to fur-trapping communities in the New World in the 1700s and early 1800s. But the brown rats of Europe became the true globe-trotters. As Western European countries colonized other parts of the world, they took the rodents with them. The brown rats of New York and other Eastern American cities trace their ancestry to those in Western Europe. So do brown rats in South America, Africa, New Zealand, and isolated islands scattered across the Atlantic and Pacific.

But he and his colleagues found very little evidence of genetic mixing in New York, or in the other cities they studied. ""You don't see a lot of recent migrants arriving and reproducing,"" he said. ""There's some force keeping them out."" Michael Kohn, an evolutionary biologist at Rice University, said the difficulties that brown rats now encountered in cities was intriguing. ""It's not hard to get there,"" he said. ""But it's hard to get in."" The reason may be that brown rats are territorial and just plain mean, as Dr. Munshi-South often is reminded when he inspects the specimens caught in traps. Many of them bear the marks of fights with other brown rats. ""They've got scars, they're missing eyes, they're missing part of their tail,"" he said. ""Their life is fairly brutal."" The researchers now theorize that the first brown rats to show up in a city rapidly fill it up. Later, when bedraggled latecomers tumble out of ships in the city's ports, the stronger residents rebuff them. To Dr. Munshi-South, that's good news. ""It's unlikely that a lot of diseases are going to be entering cities on rats walking into the local rat population,"" he said. If that's true, then the new study also contains a strange paradox. As much as we dislike brown rats, they may be our staunchest defenders."
39504,"The Purpose of Sleep? To Forget, Scientists Say","Two studies suggest that the brain edits itself during sleep, paring back the tangle of neurons that grows in waking hours.",A PET scan of a brain during normal sleep. Two scientists say sleep may help the brain prune back unneeded synapses.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/science/03ZIMMER/03ZIMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=ba43f447f45b1ed2267624501049e83a7e4a92a10aa6aed03476ad7d6850a5f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/science/sleep-memory-brain-forgetting.html,ca26121f-6305-5ba9-96dc-7ea2a11926d0.jpg,"Over the years, scientists have come up with a lot of ideas about why we sleep. Some have argued that it's a way to save energy. Others have suggested that slumber provides an opportunity to clear away the brain's cellular waste. Still others have proposed that sleep simply forces animals to lie still, letting them hide from predators. A pair of papers published on Thursday in the journal Science offer evidence for another notion: We sleep to forget some of the things we learn each day. In order to learn, we have to grow connections, or synapses, between the neurons in our brains. These connections enable neurons to send signals to one another quickly and efficiently. We store new memories in these networks. In 2003, Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli, biologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, proposed that synapses grew so exuberantly during the day that our brain circuits got ""noisy."" When we sleep, the scientists argued, our brains pare back the connections to lift the signal over the noise.

In the years since, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli, along with other researchers, have found a great deal of indirect evidence to support the so-called synaptic homeostasis hypothesis. It turns out, for example, that neurons can prune their synapses -- at least in a dish. In laboratory experiments on clumps of neurons, scientists can give them a drug that spurs them to grow extra synapses. Afterward, the neurons pare back some of the growth. Other evidence comes from the electric waves released by the brain. During deep sleep, the waves slow down. Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli have argued that shrinking synapses produce this change. Four years ago, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli got a chance to test their theory by looking at the synapses themselves. They acquired a kind of deli slicer for brain tissue, which they used to shave ultrathin sheets from a mouse's brain.

The synapses in the brains of sleeping mice, they found, were 18 percent smaller than in awake ones. ""That there's such a big change over all is surprising,"" Dr. Tononi said. The second study was led by Graham H. Diering, a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Diering and his colleagues set out to explore the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis by studying the proteins in mouse brains. ""I'm really coming at it from this nuts-and-bolts place,"" Dr. Diering said. In one experiment, Dr. Diering and his colleagues created a tiny window through which they could peer into mouse brains. Then he and his colleagues added a chemical that lit up a surface protein on brain synapses. Looking through the window, they found that the number of surface proteins dropped during sleep. That decline is what you would expect if the synapses were shrinking. Dr. Diering and his colleagues then searched for the molecular trigger for this change. They found that hundreds of proteins increase or decrease inside of synapses during the night. But one protein in particular, called Homer1A, stood out. In earlier experiments on neurons in a dish, Homer1A proved to be important for paring back synapses. Dr. Diering wondered if it was important in sleep, too.

To find out, he and his colleagues studied mice genetically engineered so that they couldn't make Homer1A proteins. These mice slept like ordinary mice, but their synapses didn't change their proteins like the ones in ordinary mice. Dr. Diering's research suggests that sleepiness triggers neurons to make Homer1A and ship it into their synapses. When sleep arrives, Homer1A turns on the pruning machinery. To see how this pruning machinery affects learning, the scientists gave regular mice a memory test. They put the animals in a room where they got a mild electric shock if they walked over one section of the floor. That night, the scientists injected a chemical into the brains of some of the mice. The chemical had been shown to block neurons in dishes from pruning their synapses. The next day, the scientists put all the mice back in the chamber they had been in before. Both groups of mice spent much of the time frozen, fearfully recalling the shock. But when the researchers put the mice in a different chamber, they saw a big difference. The ordinary mice sniffed around curiously. The mice that had been prevented from pruning their brain synapses during sleep, on the other hand, froze once again. Dr. Diering thinks that the injected mice couldn't narrow their memories down to the particular chamber where they had gotten the shock. Without nighttime pruning, their memories ended up fuzzy.

""You may actually work against yourself,"" Dr. Tononi said. In the future, sleep medicines might precisely target the molecules involved in sleep, ensuring that synapses get properly pruned. ""Once you know a little bit of what happens at the ground-truth level, you can get a better idea of what to do for therapy,"" Dr. Tononi said."

Or poison, stab or hang him. Or bake him into a pie. Or tear him apart, mistaking him for a mountain lion. The messenger deserves a break. Because we all know that old showbiz advice: Show, don't tell. But sometimes even the telling is bad and hard enough. Here's one messenger: ""I tell these stories/Suffering twice: feeling terrible pains/In telling it, suffering again what was already suffered.""

The questions of why we report catastrophe and why we listen to those reports inform ""Bad News! i was there...,"" a brainy, provocative, somewhat overwrought oratorio of messenger speeches collaged from classic Greek plays and more recent texts by the director JoAnne Akalaitis. (The Ancient Greeks believed that while you shouldn't show violence onstage, you should definitely have a messenger run on and describe, gruesomely, what was done.) It's about how bad news -- the giving and the receiving of it -- constitutes us as a community who now know just how wrong things can go.

Arriving at N.Y.U. Skirball, audience members are divided into four color-coded groups and invited to look at the lobby walls, which have been papered with family trees, god-and-hero explainers and reprints of art inspired by Greek myths. Headlines from The New York Times are there, too -- a nudge that the tragic cycle keeps recurring and our appetite for disaster endures.

Eight actors appear -- four men and four women, all wearing high-visibility vests, who speak and sing some lines from the tragedies. One repeats, in different languages: ""I was there, and I will tell you everything."""
51693,Ads Show Up on Breitbart and Brands Blame Technology,How does a progressive company find itself pitched on a hard-right website? A third-party ad network is using consumer data and targeting technology.,A Macy's banner ad on the Breitbart website.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/30/business/01BREITBART2/01BREITBART2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=0260915a6321fc498facd28968a0a2e2a82b44ed84583ed042831d24239c66e0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/business/media/breitbart-vanguard-ads-follow-users-target-marketing.html,2d1e5303-f3b8-5f78-93d1-71a53ec5e85f.jpg,"The Vanguard Group does its best to stay away from politics when advertising, going so far as to have a policy against marketing on overtly partisan websites. So it was a surprise to Vanguard, an investment management company, when it found its ads on Breitbart News, the hard-right site that has become closely tied to President-elect Donald J. Trump. An email from a client alerted Vanguard to the issue last week, prompting it to pull its ads from the site. Breitbart had been inadvertently included on a list of preapproved websites the company and its ad agency use to try to reach people who have visited Vanguard's site, said Emily Farrell, a spokeswoman. Vanguard is one of at least a dozen companies, including prominent brands like Allstate, Kellogg and Warby Parker, that have said recently that they will stop advertising on Breitbart. The brands have attributed their appearances on the site to the automated nature of online advertising, in which a complicated system of third-party networks and agencies is used to place ads. That has cast a spotlight on how the zeal to capitalize on consumer data and advanced targeting technologies has resulted in some companies' being associated with sites they want to avoid. It is increasingly rare for marketers and their agencies to place ads directly on websites. Unlike advertising on television or in magazines, where brands often choose placements in advance based on content, marketers online deploy sophisticated technologies to target and personalize ads in real time for the people who are most likely to be interested in their products or services, wherever they may be roaming on the web.

Kris Charles, a Kellogg representative, said that while the company reviewed sites for potential ad placements ""using filtering technology to assess the words and phrases that make up a site's content,"" there is also ""a very large volume of websites, so occasionally something is inadvertently missed."" All of this has resulted in the kind of publicity -- and political repercussions -- brands were hoping to avoid. After Kellogg said it would stop advertising on Breitbart because the site was not ""aligned with our values as a company,"" pointing to publicly available marketing guidelines, Breitbart started a #DumpKelloggs boycott campaign. Larry Solov, Breitbart's chief executive, said in an editorial that the cereal maker ""has shown its contempt for Breitbart's 45 million readers and for the main street American values that they hold dear.""

A spokeswoman for Breitbart did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Allstate responded to one consumer's complaint about its appearance on Breitbart by saying, ""Unfortunately, the nature of internet media buys is such that we are not always able to receive full disclosure with regards to all of the websites on which our advertising may run,"" though it would exclude Breitbart from its ad buys in the future. The eyeglass company Warby Parker blamed ""third-party ad networks or ad exchanges,"" and affirmed its commitment to diversity and inclusivity. Other brands, including Nissan, have said they aim to reach as many customers as possible and do not plan to change their advertising strategy based on complaints from some consumers. The nuances of how a brand ends up on a website, however, are often meaningless to consumers who may associate the two regardless of whether they have a direct relationship -- which is being highlighted anew as tensions run high after the election.

About two weeks ago, a Twitter account called ""Sleeping Giants"" was created with the goal of choking off ad dollars going to Breitbart, urging people to screenshot ads on the site, then post those pictures and flag the advertisers. (The New York Times is among companies that have been criticized for advertising on the site.) Workable, a start-up that sells recruiting software and champions diversity, was flagged by the account, which has roughly 6,000 followers, for having a banner ad on Breitbart above the headline, ""There's No Hiring Bias Against Women in Tech, They Just Suck at Interviews."" A screenshot of the ad was posted and sent to Nikos Moraitakis, Workable's chief executive, who said he ""nearly had a heart attack"" when he saw it. Workable's ad ended up on the site through one of the Google companies that brokers web ads, and Workable has now added Breitbart to an ""opt out"" list, Mr. Moraitakis said in an interview. But even as it has blocked Breitbart, ""there's probably another 10 sites we haven't excluded,"" he said. ""We rely on our ad networks to keep the networks clean, and then obviously, the big ethical question is what clean means,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, these hate speech sites and fake news sites are a new breed, and I don't think Google has caught on to them."" He added, ""The unfortunate side effect of this is that to the consumer, it looks like we are directing our advertising dollars to a specific media site."" Most ads are placed based on data about the user rather than the content of the website, and limits are set after the fact -- say, ensuring that brands do not show up next to pornography or neo-Nazi literature. This process is known as blacklisting, and because of the sheer number of websites, brands tend to value its efficiency over any qualms they may have about appearing in the wrong place at the wrong time.

To some, that illustrates the underlying problem. Joe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group, said that while audience profile ""matters first and foremost,"" there ""has to be a better standard set for the environment"" where an ad will appear. ""When you buy so many sites that you don't know them all, there's almost no way to kind of guarantee you're not going to be supporting something fraudulent, sensationalist or alt-right or whatever the content happens to be,"" he said. The uproar about Breitbart with the separate issue of fake news sites has sent advertisers to online ad verification companies like DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science. On Thursday, DoubleVerify added an ""Inflammatory Politics & News"" category to a list of more than 75 categories that advertisers can choose to avoid. If selected, it will block ads from appearing on sites including Breitbart, Rawstory.com, WND.com, LibertyWritersNews.com and YoungCons.com, the company said. ""With the surge in these new sites that are living on unsubstantiated stories that are oftentimes very politically charged, large brands are coming to us and ensuring that their ads don't appear on those kinds of sites,"" said Wayne Gattinella, the chief executive of DoubleVerify. Breitbart said in its editorial that Kellogg's move would have ""virtually no revenue impact"" on the site. While at least one ad tech firm, AppNexus, has barred Breitbart from using its tools, citing a violation of its hate speech rules, data from Ghostery, a data governance company, shows that the site works with many ad tech companies. And while select brands have pulled away from the site, plenty of others remain. Still, John Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at the advertising giant WPP's GroupM, predicts that the price of ads on Breitbart could decline, affecting the company's revenue, if enough ""venerable brands"" act. ""Since the Breitbart issue came up, we've obviously been talking to our people internationally and making sure they have their clients understand if they don't want to be on political sites, we need to put them onto the blacklist,"" Mr. Montgomery said in an interview. ""Particularly after the publicity of the election there are many big brands who are having these discussions with agencies right now."""

""Well,"" he said the other day in the gleaming kitchen of Le Coucou, the restaurant he plans to open in May in the 11 Howard hotel in SoHo. ""What is a steak frites?"" He pondered that. He cocked his head. His gaze drifted off. He looked a little like Dustin Hoffman playing Lenny Bruce trying to tease out a joke in his head. ""A little bit of that fresh bloody thing,"" he finally said. ""I like that."" He mused on crispness -- ""the water in the lettuce"" as a necessary element in a good salad, and frites whose perfection arises from ""nothing but potatoes, oil and salt."" ""That's the genius of the French tradition,"" he said. As one can tell from his Socratic method, Mr. Rose likes to puzzle out his food. At 38, he's a bit of a puzzle himself: a student philosopher turned chef, and a Chicago native who climbed to the top of the Parisian food world 10 years ago with a tiny ingredient-obsessed Right Bank restaurant called Spring.

The contradictions continue: Now this champion of fastidious French tradition is returning to the United States in a partnership with Stephen Starr, the protean Philadelphia-based restaurateur who has the reputation, fair or not, of being more a blockbuster crowd-pleaser than a mentor to culinary brainiacs. For the debut of Le Coucou, which will be the first time this American in Paris has cooked in an American restaurant, Mr. Rose and his family have rented an apartment in Brooklyn. He's not sure how he'll juggle cooking on two continents, but he expects to be dug in at Le Coucou at least through the first cycle of reviews.

He arrived in Paris in the late 1990s after plunging into philosophy and Greek literature at St. John's College in New Mexico, and he got into cooking (after a failed attempt to join the French Foreign Legion) ""the way I approach a lot of this stuff, which is to ask a question,"" he said. ""What is a French restaurant? What is a restaurant? I spend too much time thinking about stuff like that. The antidote to that was the doing."" So what is a cerebral purist like him doing with Mr. Starr, a guy who oversees (at press time) 34 restaurants? The auteur in Mr. Rose finds it appealing, and reassuring, that Le Coucou will be supported by a well-oiled engine of commerce. Mr. Starr, for his part, takes issue with those who characterize him as resolutely middlebrow. ""I dispute that,"" he said in the kitchen with Mr. Rose. ""I was a populist, and I'm a populist now in order to make money and survive."" In Hollywood, summer superhero movies can subsidize the Oscar-worthy character studies. In a similar way, Mr. Starr said, mass-appeal magnets like Buddakan help finance chef-driven labors of love like Upland, the Clocktower, Serpico (in Philadelphia) and now Le Coucou. ""I will never make a lot of money here, in this restaurant,"" Mr. Starr said. ""That's not the point. My heart is in these types of restaurants, but you've got to pay for the things.""

""How did you get that through customs?"" Mr. Starr asked. If that seems a deeply French gesture, Mr. Rose's response is apt to be ""mais oui."" His success in Paris is attributable not only to his skill in the kitchen, but also to his complete immersion in Frenchness. His cooking betrays little interest in giving the classics a 21st-century tuneup; he says he has never cooked a cheeseburger or pasta, outside of meals he may whip up for his two children, ages 2 and 4. If anything, his dishes stand as reverent personal tributes to the tradition that produced them. ""His love for French cuisine and French culture made him accepted by the French, by the Parisians,"" said his friend Gregory Marchand, the chef behind another popular spot, called Frenchie. Mr. Rose did break from custom in at least one notable way. ""Restaurants in France, and particularly in Paris, were never known for their glowing, warm service -- though there are certainly standout exceptions,"" said the Paris-based journalist Lindsey Tramuta, whose book ""The New Paris,"" about cultural change in the city, will appear next year. Mr. Rose's approach to hospitality stood out. ""So here comes Daniel with his enthusiasm, natural warmth and a genuine passion for interacting with diners,"" Ms. Tramuta said. ""In the first version of Spring, he was cooking entirely alone and had close contact to each and every diner, delivering the dishes to the tables in many instances. Dining in his restaurants feels very much what I would imagine it would be like to dine in his home, and that's extremely rare.""

His obsession? Ingredients. ""That moment of tasting veal that really tastes like veal is a very powerful thing,"" he said. Nearly all chefs these days rhapsodize about the quality of their carrots, but Mr. Rose is known for applying a fanatical focus to finding the best chicken, the best oyster, the most exquisite onion. ""No matter how much it costs,"" Mr. Marchand said, ""he's really crazy about the quality of the products."" His madness was on display on a recent Tuesday afternoon as he huddled around the stove with members of his crew at Le Coucou to test the ingredients he had hunted down. ""We put it in a hot pan and cook it,"" he said. ""That's how we learn about it."" From the sound in the pan, he said, he could divine the quality of certain ingredients -- ""not that I have X-Men powers or something."" In the oven simmered a rich Alsatian-style stew called a baeckeoffe, layered with sliced potatoes and the melting fat of short ribs, lamb shoulder and pork cheeks. Mr. Rose saw it as a tribute to Andre Soltner, the great French chef whose restaurant Lutece dazzled New Yorkers for decades. (Mr. Rose envisions Le Coucou as something of a ""Lutece reboot,"" even though he never ate there. ""Crazy, right?"" he said. ""I'm talking about what my idea of Lutece is."")

Here, duck and foie gras served over a bed of slightly fermented daikon radish. Christopher Gregory for The New York Times But most of his work this day was radically simple. He poached a chicken. He watched as sea bream was sauteed in a pan. He breathed in the scent of oysters. Mr. Rose is particularly serious about chicken. He had at least a dozen varieties to test over the course of a few days. Most disappointed him. He sliced off a knob of meat and nibbled on it. His eyes revealed a man lost in thought. ""Same problem,"" he said. ""Bitter. Is that just my tongue or is that for real? I got that funky bitterness again!"" Tim Lu, Le Coucou's executive sous-chef, tried it, too. ""Oh, yeah,"" he said. An almost hidden wave of disgust and frustration passed over Mr. Rose's face. ""Now I'm getting kind of grumpy,"" he said. ""It doesn't taste very good at all. You know where the best chicken we've had was from? Chinatown."" Mr. Rose's cooking depends on the delicious integrity of these core ingredients; he is averse to frills and adornments that may interfere with one's communion with the essence of hen or oyster. He needed his kitchen team to understand what he wants. But there was another part of that, too. ""They're already learning to anticipate what it is that I don't want,"" he said.

404,Review: 'The Outsider' Takes a Stephen King Novel and Makes It Darker,The mystery-horror hybrid gets a stylish and extremely moody adaptation from HBO and Richard Price.,"Ben Mendelsohn and Cynthia Erivo in ""The Outsider,"" an HBO adaptation of a Stephen King novel.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/11/arts/10outsider-review-print1/10outsider-review-print1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=576d8b48b33c2f53bbcfd9c4cd5ecbc976a66ad1a22e16ccb8e5ca5f7ba493bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/arts/television/the-outsider-stephen-king-review.html,a2abf4c8-aeff-5d39-8668-07ff1dca17cb.jpg,"""The Outsider"" is not generally considered to be really top-flight Stephen King. If you look up rankings of his novels, it tends to come in around the midpoint at best and often much lower. Some people are turned off by the way it segues from police procedural mystery to supernatural skirmish. Others think the villain just isn't scary enough. Presumably the writer Richard Price and the actor and producer Jason Bateman, two of the main forces behind the 10-episode adaptation of ""The Outsider"" that begins Sunday on HBO, liked the book. You have to wonder, though. Based on the first six episodes, they've gloomed it up and slowed it down, keeping much of the basic story but making something radically different in tone and atmosphere. It's ""The Outsider"" dipped in noir sauce and coated in HBO-prestige bread crumbs. Is it an improvement? Having just read the book, I missed King's energy and earnestness, and most of all his sense of relentless forward motion. In HBO's ""Outsider"" the camera slowly glides, or creeps, or just sits still while actors try out their hard or perplexed or grieving stares. It doubles down on a kind of blue-tinged moodiness that's a popular mode in television mystery these days, from ""The Sinner"" on USA to Price's ""The Night Of"" for HBO. (Bateman directed the first two episodes.) It takes King's spooky, jokey, thinly characterized plot machine and turns it into a psychological workout.

If that lines up with your taste, ""The Outsider"" will be perfectly watchable and probably even enjoyable. The cast, led by Ben Mendelsohn, Cynthia Erivo, Mare Winningham and Julianne Nicholson, is excellent. And Price -- he wrote a majority of the episodes, with another eminent crime novelist, Dennis Lehane, contributing a few more -- keeps the mystery legible and credible (while negotiating a change of venue to Georgia from Oklahoma). Just settle in for a very slow boil.

Show and book both begin with the discovery of the body of an 11-year-old boy, horrifically murdered, and move directly to the arrest of a solid local citizen, Terry Maitland (Bateman), while he's coaching a youth baseball game. The detective in charge, Ralph Anderson (Mendelsohn), arrests Maitland quickly and publicly because of the crime's brutality but primarily because the evidence against him -- fingerprints, multiple witnesses, surveillance footage -- is so overwhelming. But as quickly as it came together, the case begins to fall apart. There's equally compelling evidence that Maitland was at a teacher's conference in another town when the murder was committed. How could he have been in two places at once? And is the answer connected to the eerie premonitions and visitations that begin to afflict people connected to the case, including the wives of Anderson and Maitland (Winningham and Nicholson)? It is, of course, and part of the fun of the book is the subversive way in which King constructs a classic mystery scenario, studded with references to Poe and Robert Ludlum, and then doesn't bother to solve it in the usual style. The case of Terry Maitland seems impossible, and it is -- unless you accept a paranormal explanation (and a classic Stephen King type of story), which Anderson, a dogmatic realist, isn't at first prepared to do.

The literary allusions have been dropped in the series, understandably, but the novel holds a greater challenge for adapters. In service of the bifurcated plot, and indulging his habit of shuffling people from book to book, King revives an old character -- the private investigator Holly Gibney (Erivo), from ""Mr. Mercedes"" -- and drops her in halfway through ""The Outsider,"" to function as Anderson's tough-love guide to the world of storybook predators. The awkward but resolute Gibney is the best thing about ""The Outsider,"" and Price and company know it -- they've smushed the first half of the book into the first couple of episodes of the series so that they can introduce her earlier, and from there the series is in large part a showcase for Erivo, the star of ""Harriet"" and the coming season of ""Genius"" devoted to Aretha Franklin. Erivo capably embodies Gibney's under-the-surface compassion and strength, but her performance is hemmed in by the show's decision to amp up the character's idiosyncrasies -- this Gibney is practically a rain-woman savant, and Erivo's attempts to give that some nuance can just end up looking dull. King's Gibney drew an excitement and satisfaction from her investigative work that Price's character doesn't seem to feel. And that tweak is just one of many changes, small and large, that push the show in dark and heavy directions. A suicide, glancingly referred to in the book, is now onscreen and graphic. The amount of time spent in a dank strip club has gone way up. Most tellingly, Anderson's son, alive in the book, is now dead, generating additional stress and marital discord. There may be a Jason Bateman effect at work here. Noirish gloom seems to follow him around: The first season of Netflix's ""Ozark"" (the only one I've seen) took material that wanted to be dark comedy and squeezed much of the fun out of it, though Laura Linney, as the wife of Bateman's antihero, worked heroically to counteract that. ""The Outsider"" takes an entertaining and propulsive, if routine, read and renders it with style and savvy but not much of a pulse. Watch the show and -- spoiler alert! -- you may find that that's kind of what the killer does, too."

A gentle, genial dip into a pool of midlife despair, Gilles Lellouche's body-positive comedy, ""Sink or Swim,"" follows a small group of variously troubled men who find purpose in forming an all-male synchronized swimming team. The sights attending this endeavor are as pasty and pitiful as you're no doubt imagining. Yet if you keep your eyes on the faces (and the subtitles), you'll catch the tiny stabs of sadness that wrap the often flimsy jokes in a casing of compassion.

""So what's the point of me?,"" one hapless water-baby inquires when his boss at the swimming pool tells him a computer runs everything. Selling a tragic-to-triumphant story arc repurposed from any number of similar crowd-pleasers, Lellouche is blessed with seasoned actors who know how to charm. Mathieu Amalric effortlessly holds the lead as Bertrand, a rumpled, unemployed depressive whose spaniel eyes and drooping belly telegraph someone who has long been comfortable with pain. His teammates, though, suffer from a shamelessly commercial and damply sentimental script that tries to cram too many tales of woe into a single package.

Individually, the men battle a bankruptcy, a failed musical career and overwhelming family responsibilities. Together, they find solace in the water, in the bar and in a postworkout sauna. Movies like this are always about friendship, not trophies; even so, the synchronized swimming World Championship beckons. ""Find your inner woman,"" their equally troubled coach, Delphine (Virginie Efira), advises. So it's off to Norway to compete against rival teams lethally armed with the washboard abs and ironclad buttocks we've all been waiting for. Speaking for myself (and possibly the attentive cinematographer), that finale was almost worth the wait. Not rated. In French, English, Norwegian and Sinhalese, with subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 2 minutes."

He was 90. His son Josh said that the cause had not been determined, but that his father had had neuropathy. Mr. Friedman, who also wrote the screenplays for the hit film comedies ""Stir Crazy"" and ""Splash,"" was an unusual case in American letters: an essentially comic writer whose work skipped back and forth between literature and pop culture and who, after an early decade of literary stardom, seemed almost to vanish in plain sight. Like his contemporaries Joseph Heller, Stanley Elkin and Thomas Pynchon, he wrote what came to be called black humor, largely because of an anthology by that name that he edited in 1965. His first two novels, ""Stern"" (1962) and the best-selling ""A Mother's Kisses"" (1964) -- tales of New York Jews exploring an America outside the five boroughs -- and his first play, the 1967 Off Broadway hit ""Scuba Duba,"" a sendup of race relations that is set in motion when a Jewish man fears his wife is having an affair with a black spear fisherman, made him widely celebrated. The New York Times Magazine in 1968 declared Mr. Friedman ""The Hottest Writer of the Year.""

A deadpan prose stylist with a keen ear for the absurdly self-involved dialogue that emanates from neurosis, Mr. Friedman was, at his best, a savage social satirist. He took advantage of the social upheaval he lived through in the 1960s and '70s to write about race and gender relations from the suddenly uncertain perspective of men like, well, himself, gleefully tweaking the white male psyche's tenderest spots. In ""Black Angels,"" a short story often cited as emblematic of his early and most literary work, the main character, Stefano, is a white man left alone, despairing and struggling to keep up the maintenance on his house after his wife takes their young child and runs off with another man, ""an assistant director of daytime TV"" (a typically arch Friedmanesque detail). He finds salvation in the form of a team of black yard workers, led by a man named Cotten, who labor for bargain prices. The story, which takes place almost entirely in Stefano's fevered and guilt-ridden mind, ends when he invites Cotten in for a beer, begins confessing his problems and places the gardener in the role of a shrink -- a service, Cotten says, for which he charges $400 an hour. In his novel ""Stern,"" an Air Force veteran moves his family from the city to the suburbs, where a brief anti-Semitic and sexually charged encounter between his wife and a neighbor unleashes a virulent stream of neuroses.

""In the Air Force, Stern, recently married and swiftly packing on hip fat, felt isolated, a nonflying officer in a flying service, at a time when jets were coming in and there was no escaping them,"" Mr. Friedman wrote. ""The air,"" he continued, ""was full of strange new jet sounds and the ground reverberated with the throb of them. Somehow Stern connected his nonflying status with his Jewishness, as though flying were a golden, crew-cut, gentile thing while Jewishness was a cautious and scholarly quality that crept into engines and prevented planes from lurching off the ground with recklessness."" ""Stern"" was almost universally praised as a shrewd and humorous take on the psychic terrors of seemingly serene suburbia. ""A Mother's Kisses"" could be thought of as something of a prequel, the story of a 17-year-old Brooklyn boy whose bulldozing mother arranges his admission to an agricultural college in Kansas and then follows him out there. Mr. Friedman's novel ""A Mother's Kisses"" (1964) was a best seller and introduced readers to a character one critic called ""the most unforgettable mother since Medea."" ""A Mother's Kisses"" was adapted into a stage musical that nearly made it to Broadway (it closed out of town). It introduced readers not only to Joseph, Mr. Friedman's portrait of a lonely, perplexed Jew as a young man, but also to the indomitable Meg, a woman whom Haskel Frankel, writing in The New York Times Book Review and sparing no hyperbole, called ""the most unforgettable mother since Medea."" Mr. Friedman followed up with two novels that changed milieus, imbuing both an urban detective (in ""The Dick,"" 1970) and a cocaine-addled screenwriter (""About Harry Towns,"" 1974) with the signature qualities of bafflement and self-questioning. And he continued to write short stories, including ""A Change of Plan,"" a comic tale about brutal selfishness in which a young man goes on a Florida honeymoon, meets another woman at the hotel pool and ditches his new wife for her. Adapted by Mr. Simon, the story became, as the women's movement was taking hold in 1972, a highly provocative film, ""The Heartbreak Kid,"" starring Mr. Grodin, Cybill Shepherd and Jeannie Berlin, whose mother, Elaine May, directed. (A 2007 remake, starring Ben Stiller, was directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly.)

""It hit some kind of chord,"" Mr. Friedman said to a Key West, Fla., audience in 2005 after reading the story aloud. ""I guess maybe it's not unusual when people are walking down the aisle for an instant to flash on the possibility that maybe they're making a mistake. Maybe there's someone else. I know it happened to me. ""People ask where do stories come from,"" he continued. ""Well, they come from a lot of places. Very often it's your life, and then you extrapolate from a personal experience. In my case, yeah, OK, I got married, went down to Florida, we were exhausted, my wife fell asleep, I went down to the pool and I saw a very pretty girl. And I said, 'Oh, God.' And I did tell her I was a little married, and she just splashed some water at me. That pretty much ended it. I went back into the marriage, had three children. And then got divorced. ""But that's how a story will happen. You have a fragment of an experience and ask yourself, 'What if?'"" Bruce Jay Friedman was born on April 26, 1930, and grew up, along with his sister, Dollie, in a three-room apartment in the Bronx, much like the crowded one in Brooklyn he described in ""A Mother's Kisses."" His father, Irving, worked for a women's apparel company; his mother, Molly, a confident woman with a feisty patter and a devoted theatergoer who was described by a friend of Bruce's as ""someone looking like a middle-aged Jewish Rita Hayworth,"" was evidently the model for Meg. After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School and, like Joseph, failing to get into Columbia University, he went to the University of Missouri, where he studied journalism. He spent two years in the Air Force, during which he wrote for a military publication called Air Training. Shortly after returning to the Bronx, Mr. Friedman sold his first short story, ""Wonderful Golden Rule Days,"" about a boy making his discomforting way in a new school, to The New Yorker. He took a job with a company called Magazine Management and rose to become editor of somewhat cheesy men's adventure publications with names like Male, Men's World, Men and True Action.

""The truth is, I tortured myself by moving back and forth, from one to the other,"" he wrote in ""Lucky Bruce,"" in which he also acknowledged the career arc that started at the top and declined. ""Stories, quite a few of them, got written and published,"" he wrote of the later years of his writing life. ""If they lacked energy (were less frantic?) I assured myself they were more 'dimensional.' Once I discovered that comforting description, I clung to it like life itself. There were a few books, some plays that still need attention. And quite a few pieces about me in the literary journals, wondering what had happened to me. ""Where had I gone? I began to feel like the most (fondly) remembered forgotten writer in America."""
14561,"In 'A Promised Land,' Barack Obama Thinks — and Thinks Some More — Over His First Term",The former president recounts his political ascent and offers close-up views of the major issues he faced during his first years in the White House.,"""A Promised Land,"" the first of two planned volumes, will be published Tuesday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/15/business/15obamabook-print2/15obamabook-print2-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fe86d86e97544999864da760ac3ce2663a7bfec488cb476f0cfe5c60d7de7512&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/15/books/review-barack-obama-promised-land-memoir.html,02cc717e-114d-5d09-9901-4f4345f68d15.jpg,"[The Best Books of 2020: View our full list.] The most audacious thing about Barack Obama's new memoir, ""A Promised Land,"" is the beaming portrait on its cover: There he is, the 44th president, looking so serenely confident that it's as if the book weren't arriving on the heels of a bitter election, amid a cratering economy and a raging pandemic. The ebullient image also stands at odds with the narrative inside -- 700 pages that are as deliberative, measured and methodical as the author himself. Obama says that he initially planned to write a 500-page memoir and be done in a year; what he ended up with instead is a hefty volume (now the first of an anticipated two) that stops in May 2011, shortly after his roasting of Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents' Dinner on April 30 and the killing of Osama bin Laden the day after. Obama's extraordinary first book, ""Dreams From My Father,"" was published in 1995, a year before he was elected to the Illinois senate, and traced his family history alongside his own coming-of-age. ""A Promised Land"" is necessarily less intimate and more political, offering close-up views of the major issues that Obama faced during his first term, including the economic stimulus, health care, immigration, the environment and the forever war in Afghanistan. Presumably left for the future volume are, among other fraught subjects: the 2016 election, his abdication of his own ""red line"" in Syria, the entrenchment of the surveillance state and a discussion of drone strikes. This isn't to say that ""A Promised Land"" reads like a dodge; if anything, its length testifies to what seems to be a consistently held faith on the part of the former president -- that if he just describes his thinking in sufficient detail, and clearly lays out the constellation of obstacles and constraints he faced, any reasonable American would have to understand why he governed as he did.

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of November. See the full list. ] Nearly every president since Theodore Roosevelt has written a memoir that covers his years in office; this one contains some inevitable moments of reputation-burnishing and legacy-shaping, though the narrative hews so closely to Obama's own discursive habits of thought that any victories he depicts feel both hard-won and tenuous. An adverb he likes to use is ""still"" -- placed at the beginning of a sentence, to qualify and counter whatever he said just before. Another favorite is ""maybe,"" as he reflects on alternatives to what happened, offering frank confessions of his own uncertainties and doubts. At a time of grandiose mythologizing, he marshals his considerable storytelling skills to demythologize himself. He addresses the book to the ""next generation,"" to young people who seek to ""remake the world,"" but the story he tells is less about unbridled possibility and more about the forces that inhibit it.

He periodically reminds us how he inherited a state of emergency. As one of his friends said after Obama's historic win in 2008, when the economy was getting devoured by the Great Recession: ""Two hundred and thirty-two years and they wait until the country's falling apart before they turn it over to the brother!"" Once in office, Obama sought the help of experienced insiders instead of ""fresh talent,"" deciding that the dire circumstances ""demanded it."" Obama says he had ambitious ideas for structural change, but that his team insisted that any attempts to mete out some ""Old Testament justice"" to the banks whose avarice and recklessness had pushed the financial system to the brink would send skittish markets into a full-blown panic. But quelling markets did little to quell anger and fear -- something that conservatives, Obama noticed, were quick to seize on and use to their advantage, while the president deemed it perilous to tap into such incendiary emotions. (This seemed to be an ingrained sensibility: David Maraniss's 2012 biography of Obama has one of his mentors recalling with a touch of exasperation how even when they were doing community organizing in Chicago, Obama was ""reluctant to do confrontation, to push the other side because it might blow up."") What could have been politically beneficial to him, Obama takes pains to spell out, would have risked degrading the institutions that needed to be repaired, not demolished.

There's a dynamic that Obama describes again and again in ""A Promised Land"": establishment Republicans shrewdly finding ways to appropriate and exploit the feelings of helplessness and resentment that their own deregulatory policies had helped to bring about in the first place. ""If all this seems obvious to me now, it wasn't at the time,"" Obama writes. ""My team and I were too busy."" He recalls a Republican senator telling him, ""I hate to say it, but the worse people feel right now, the better it is for us."" (This senator may have hated to say it, but he loved to see it.) The result was a drubbing in the 2010 midterms, when Democrats lost an astounding 63 seats in the House. About the substance of those first two years in office, Obama expresses few regrets. ""We had saved the economy,"" he writes. ""We had stabilized the global financial system and yanked the U.S. auto industry from the brink of collapse."" The Affordable Care Act made health care available to another 20 million Americans. The midterms ""didn't prove that our agenda had been wrong. It just proved that -- whether for lack of talent, cunning, charm or good fortune -- I'd failed to rally the nation, as F.D.R. had once done, behind what I knew to be right."" The tone that Obama strikes in lines like these is almost mournful. He shows how a certain kind of blunt candor seemed all but unavailable to him as the first Black president. After he offered the mildest rebuke of the police officer who arrested the scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. on his own front porch, saying that the officer acted ""stupidly,"" his support among white voters plunged. In public, Obama was unfailingly conciliatory, telling reporters he ""could have calibrated my original comments more carefully,"" even as he began to realize that the issue of Black people and the police was a reminder ""that the basis of our nation's social order had never been simply about consent; that it was also about centuries of state-sponsored violence by whites against Black and brown people.""

As much as he knew this, he couldn't say it. His almost zealous commitment to moderation rankled some progressives, who had assumed that his soaring campaign rhetoric meant he was a visionary bent on overturning the status quo. Whenever he felt stuck, he fell back on empathy and ""process."" They sound like incommensurate traits -- one is inventive and literary, the other is bland and technocratic. But for Obama -- who in this book demonstrates an almost compulsive tendency to imagine himself into the lives of others (whether it's Hillary Clinton, John McCain, or, in one passage, a Somali pirate) -- a sound process ""was born of necessity."" Decisions that were made after taking into account a variety of perspectives reassured him that he wasn't blinkered by his own. ""A Promised Land"" isn't entirely about the presidency. The first 200 pages move (comparatively) briskly through Obama's early years to his life in Chicago, when his burgeoning political career put a strain on his marriage to Michelle, who had curtailed some of her own ambitions so that one of them would be present for the couple's daughters. Of course, becoming president didn't yield anything that resembled a work-life balance, though it did mean that rather than commute between Chicago and Springfield, Ill., or between Chicago and Washington, he could usually be home for dinner by 6:30 before returning to the Oval Office. He would receive his President's Daily Brief (or as Michelle called it, ""The Death, Destruction and Horrible Things Book"") at the breakfast table. He happened to be at home in April 2010 when he first got word that an explosion had torn through the Deepwater Horizon, a drilling rig off the Louisiana coast, belching fire and smoke and gushing oil -- the worst oil spill in the country's history. An underwater video feed showed ""the oil pulsing in thick columns from the surrounding wreckage,"" Obama writes, ""like emanations from hell.""

The novelty and enormity of the disaster shook him. (The technology for ultradeep underwater drilling made the Exxon Valdez look like a Tinkertoy by comparison.) Until then, Obama had maintained a ""fundamental confidence"" that he ""could always come up with a solution through sound process and smart choices."" But those ""plumes of oil rushing out of a cracked earth and into the sea's ghostly depths"" seemed of another order, unassimilable to his generally imperturbable worldview. Even after the hole was plugged and the cleanup was proceeding apace, something awful had been unleashed, with the true extent of the poisoning not yet known. A hundred pages later, Obama remembers how Republicans seemed to get increasingly petulant at the prospect of working with his administration. ""It was as if my very presence in the White House had triggered a deep-seated panic,"" he writes, ""a sense that the natural order had been disrupted."" Trump had been peddling a birtherist conspiracy theory that some conservatives seemed eager to accept. Obama doesn't force the metaphor, but the events described in ""A Promised Land"" suggest that something very old and toxic in American politics had been unleashed too. It was as if the Republican Party, having sidled up to the jagged shores of white grievance, was starting to founder on them. As he writes of the Deepwater disaster: ""Where the rest of the oil ended up, what gruesome toll it took on wildlife, how much oil would eventually settle back onto the ocean floor, and what long-term effect that might have on the entire Gulf ecosystem -- it would be years before we'd have the full picture."""

17955,An Infamous 'Lolita' Musical Gets a Belated New York Debut,"A celebration of the ""My Fair Lady"" lyricist and librettist offers audiences a chance to reconsider one of his biggest flops.","The director Emily Maltby and the actress Caitlin Cohn reviewing historical material from the flop musical &ldquo;Lolita, My Love,&rdquo; which they are reviving in a workshop production.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/arts/19LOLITA1/19LOLITA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f779d2c93c27733fac5371445d184ba7c8b4bba9b08e879924a7f6ba79d1ffe9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/theater/lolita-my-love-york-theater-company-alan-jay-lerner.html,b110325a-ea7a-5834-9830-41b8a1a0857f.jpg,"The director Emily Maltby and the actress Caitlin Cohn reviewing historical material from the flop musical ""Lolita, My Love,"" which they are reviving in a workshop production.



The venue formerly known as the Mark Hellinger Theater -- now operating as the Times Square Church -- was the site of the librettist and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner's greatest triumph. When ""My Fair Lady,"" the musical he wrote with Frederick Loewe, ended its six-year run in 1962, it had broken the record for the longest-running Broadway show. But nearly a decade later, the Hellinger became a reminder of Lerner's most staggering failure. Turning from his longtime collaborator Loewe to the younger, hipper composer John Barry -- the man who gave us the James Bond theme -- Lerner adapted Vladimir Nabokov's classic novel ""Lolita"" into a musical. But in 1971, before ""Lolita, My Love"" could make its Broadway debut at the Hellinger, it closed after two disastrous out-of-town tryouts in Philadelphia and Boston. The main problem: the deeply uncomfortable subject matter. The show, much like the book it was based on, followed the notoriously unreliable narrator Humbert Humbert and his sexual obsession with the titular adolescent girl. Here was the most controversial novel of all time -- now with musical numbers. Almost 50 years after its unceremonious ending, ""Lolita, My Love"" is finally getting its New York debut as part of the York Theater Company's Musicals in Mufti series celebrating the Alan Jay Lerner centennial. (Lerner died in 1986.)

The script-in-hand production opens Feb. 24, with a revised book edited by Erik Haagensen, a playwright and frequent reworker of troubled classics. He pulled from six different Lerner scripts in an attempt to make the show more cohesive and perhaps digestible for a modern audience. ""You hear the title and immediately tense up,"" said Emily Maltby, who is directing the York production. ""But when I read it, I found that there was actually something rather interesting and rather important about this perspective on it."" ""Lolita, My Love"" starred John Neville and Dorothy Loudon, who went on to win a Tony as Miss Hannigan in ""Annie."" It is not the first musical flop to find new life in an era more willing to embrace complexity -- or to celebrate the camp appeal of a show that, on paper, shouldn't exist.

Even as a straight play, ""Lolita"" would be a tough sell: Edward Albee learned as much when his 1981 adaptation closed on Broadway after 12 performances. But this production of ""Lolita, My Love,"" like the ""Carrie"" revival, is reckoning with where the last one went wrong. The most significant change from the Boston production is the frame narrative in which Humbert is confessing his crimes, now not to the audience but to a therapist, Dr. Ray. In pushing back on Humbert's version of events and his nebulous grasp on reality, the doctor helps expose the true depths of his broken psyche, ultimately forcing him to confront the gravity of his crimes. ""There is something very poignant and important about holding this character accountable for his actions and not just presenting the story as a series of events that happen between this man and this young girl,"" Ms. Maltby said. Its flaws notwithstanding, ""Lolita, My Love"" has something of a cult following. In ""Not Since Carrie,"" the show is described as ""both a complete mistake and a superb adaptation, with a marvelous score and perfect leads."" A bootleg tape of the Boston production is the only real record of the musical, although the songs ""In the Broken-Promise Land of Fifteen"" and ""Going Going Gone"" have been recorded by such artists as Robert Goulet and Shirley Bassey.

""Lerner was struggling to find the right way to tell the story, which is in part why each draft has marked differences from the other ones, and I think he found it post-Boston,"" Mr. Haagensen said. The therapist framing device, which was in Lerner's first draft but abandoned before Boston, turned up again in the librettist's later rewrites. It was Mr. Haagensen's decision to make Dr. Ray a woman, allowing her to serve as something of a surrogate for Lolita, who, as in the novel, exists more in Humbert's imagination than as her own person. Even with Mr. Haagensen's edits, however, ""Lolita, My Love"" still centers Humbert over his victim. As Ms. Maltby acknowledged, ""If you were to do an adaptation of 'Lolita' today, it wouldn't look like this."" James Morgan, the York's producing artistic director, believes the show is worth the risk. He said that he sent the new script, along with the 1971 Boston versions, to several female friends to get their perspective. All of them told him that ""Lolita, My Love"" was worth putting on, he said. ""People have been afraid of it,"" Mr. Morgan said. ""I guess it's possible that we could be picketed by hundreds of people, but I think anyone who sees it will realize that it's not being done for the wrong reasons."" Other circumstances are likely to mitigate possible controversy. For one, this is a reading in a 160-seat theater, not a full production. For another, Caitlin Cohn, who is playing Lolita, is not an actual teenage girl but an actor in her early 20s. (In 1971, Annette Ferra played the role in Philadelphia, but was let go because she was considered too old for the part at 15. The Boston run starred 13-year-old Denise Nickerson, who went on to play Violet Beauregarde in the ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" film that same year.)

But for the cast and creative team, the appeal of this production -- apart from celebrating a largely forgotten Lerner musical -- is in the way it handles the aftermath of trauma, holding the Humberts of the world to task and allowing the title character to come into her own. ""You really do end up hearing her own voice,"" Ms. Cohn said. ""Audiences should hopefully feel very empowered by that -- that even though this man tore apart her life, he didn't tear apart everything that she is and will be."""
27042,Oxygen on Mars Adds to Atmospheric Mysteries,"After a perplexing methane burst was measured by NASA's Curiosity rover earlier this year, scientists were surprised again by variations in atmospheric oxygen.",Data gathered by NASA&rsquo;s Curiosity rover reported that levels of oxygen varied with the seasons on Mars.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/26/science/20MARS/20MARS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=df75364d2580dc20d7486093807bffa7f8bf8b10aecddf1c398e7dec0bd45d0e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/science/mars-oxygen-methane-curiosity-rover.html,e82b5bf2-90fd-5ddd-ade9-d7b6815f720c.jpg,"Data gathered by NASA's Curiosity rover reported that levels of oxygen varied with the seasons on Mars.





There is not much air on Mars -- the atmospheric pressure there is less than one one-hundredth of what we breathe on Earth -- but what little is there has baffled planetary scientists. Oxygen, which makes up about 0.13 percent of the Martian atmosphere, is the latest puzzler. In a paper published this month in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, scientists working with data gathered by NASA's Curiosity rover reported that levels of oxygen unexpectedly varied with the seasons on Mars, at least in the neighborhood that Curiosity has been driving around since 2012. That follows the rover's reading earlier this year of a large burst of methane, another gas emitted on Earth by living things and which perplexingly disappeared almost immediately. ""It's confusing but it's exciting,"" said Sushil K. Atreya, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan who works on Curiosity's atmospheric measurements. ""It keeps us on our toes. Mars is certainly not boring.""

A Mars year lasts 687 days, so the scientists studying the oxygen variations were able to examine the behavior over almost three Martian years, through December 2017. The level of oxygen ""rises relatively higher in the spring,"" said Melissa G. Trainer, a research space scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and lead author of the new paper, ""and then it comes down lower, below what we would expect later in the year."" Carbon dioxide is the main ingredient of Martian air, and scientists have understood for decades its ebb and flow. At the poles in winter, it falls out of the air and freezes to ice, then wafts back into the atmosphere as temperatures warm in the spring. High in the Martian atmosphere, ultraviolet light breaks apart carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen atoms and then closer to the ground, interactions with water shepherd the oxygen atoms into molecular pairs. Because oxygen molecules should be pretty stable, persisting about a decade, researchers expected that the amount of oxygen molecules would remain almost constant .

Curiosity's atmospheric measurements showed exactly that pattern for nitrogen and argon, two other trace gases in the Martian atmosphere. But, for oxygen, the concentrations shot up by a third during spring. ""This was a very unexpected result, an unexpected phenomenon,"" Dr. Trainer said. ""There's a lot we don't know about the oxygen cycle on Mars. That's become apparent."" Adding to the mystery, the cycle was not the same each year, and the scientists could not find an obvious explanation -- like temperature, dust storms or ultraviolet radiation -- for what changed from year to year. On Earth, most oxygen is generated by the photosynthesis of plants. But so far, for the Mars scientists, that is far down on the list of explanations. ""You've got to rule out all of the other processes first before you go there,"" Dr. Atreya said. More likely sources are chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates known to exist in the Martian dirt. ""It's pretty clear you need a flux from the surface,"" Dr. Atreya said. ""Nothing in the atmosphere is going to create this kind of rise."" But how these chemicals might release and absorb enough oxygen to explain the seasonal rise and fall is difficult to figure out, especially as there are only 19 oxygen measurements over five and a half years. An intriguing possibility is that the oxygen mystery might be tied to another trace gas, methane, that is also acting strangely in the Martian atmosphere.

Since 2003, several teams of scientists have reported large bursts of methane based on measurements from Earth-based telescopes, orbiting spacecraft and the Curiosity rover. Other times, the methane has been largely absent. The presence of methane was a surprise to scientists , because the known processes to create the gas are either biological -- methane-producing microbes -- or geothermal, which would be a promising environment for life to exist on present-day Mars. Now scientists want to know not only how methane is generated on Mars but how it quickly disappears. In June, Curiosity observed a particularly strong burp of methane -- 21 parts per billion by volume. But when it repeated the experiment a few days later , it came up empty -- less than 1 part per billion. The European Space Agency's orbiting Mars Express spacecraft passed over Gale Crater, the site of the rover, just about five hours after Curiosity measured the burst -- and did not detect anything. (The same instrument corroborated a 2013 methane burst observed by Curiosity.) ""I would say that it seems this spike measured by Curiosity was very short-lived and local,"" said Marco Giuranna, a scientist at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Italy who is in charge of the Mars Express instrument. Even between bursts, methane on Mars poses a mystery. Curiosity has measured a low but persistent presence of methane, about 410 parts per trillion, which rises and falls with the seasons. But a newer European orbiter, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, with the ability to measure as little methane as 50 parts per trillion, has yet to see any methane at all since it started taking measurements in April last year.

The Trace Gas Orbiter is looking at a region several miles above the ground and Curiosity is taking measurements at the surface. But scientists had thought that methane near the ground would mix through the higher atmosphere within a few weeks. ""The science puzzle is that these two lines of evidence just cannot be reconciled,"" Oleg Korablev of the Space Research Institute in Russia wrote in an email . Dr. Korablev is also the principal investigator of one of the two Trace Gas Orbiter instruments making methane measurements. Hakan Svedhem, the project scientist for the Trace Gas Orbiter, said: ""We know no mechanism that could destroy methane completely in such a short time. So it is really a mystery unless Curiosity sits right on top of the only local source on the planet, and even if it would, that source has to be a small one."" Scientists working on the three missions are planning to make near simultaneous observations of Gale Crater on Dec. 15 and again in late December, Dr. Giuranna said. Next year, four missions are scheduled to be launched toward Mars. Three of those -- built by NASA, China and jointly by the European Union and Russia -- will attempt to place new rovers on the planet's surface. The fourth, a United Arab Emirates spacecraft, will enter orbit. But none of them will carry instruments to measure methane or oxygen."
53268,Water Flowing From Toilet to Tap May Be Hard to Swallow,"As California and other areas of the country grapple with drought, the reuse of water is less a technological challenge than a marketing problem.","Filtering membranes in an Orange County, Calif., water purification facility. The plant opened in 2008 during the state's last drought.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/08/science/12reuse-a/12reuse-a-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=515b5d008f3b0c7d3c148bcc5a8944a6e8ff25cf12891e305e4bed9b49b7ebc2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/science/recycled-drinking-water-getting-past-the-yuck-factor.html,ec3408ad-9e94-5dc5-a903-8c848e7e7c68.jpg,"FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif. -- Water spilled out of a spigot, sparklingly clear, into a plastic cup. Just 45 minutes earlier, it was effluent, piped over from Orange County's wastewater treatment plant next door. At a specialized plant, it then went through several stages of purification that left it cleaner than anything that flows out of a home faucet or comes in a brand-name bottle. ""It's stripped down to the H, 2 and O,"" said Mike Markus, the general manager of the county water district. He was not exaggerating. Without the minerals that give most cities' supply a distinctive flavor, this water tastes of nothing. As California scrambles for ways to cope with its crippling drought and the mandatory water restrictions imposed last month by Gov. Jerry Brown, an array of ideas that were long dismissed as too controversial, expensive or unpleasant are getting a second look. One is to conserve more water; another is to turn nearby and abundant sources of water, like the Pacific Ocean, into drinking water through desalination.

Water recycling is common for uses like irrigation; purple pipes in many California towns deliver water to golf courses, zoos and farms. The West Basin Municipal Water District, which serves 17 cities in southwestern Los Angeles County, produces five types of ""designer"" water for such uses as irrigation and in cooling towers and boilers. At a more grass-roots level, activists encourage Californians to save ""gray water"" from bathroom sinks, showers, tubs and washing machines to water their plants and gardens. Enticing people to drink recycled water, however, requires getting past what experts call the ""yuck"" factor. Efforts in the 1990s to develop water reuse in San Diego and Los Angeles were beaten back by activists who denounced what they called, devastatingly, ""toilet to tap."" Los Angeles built a $55 million purification plant in the 1990s, but never used it to produce drinking water; the water goes to irrigation instead.

The $481 million plant opened during a previous drought. ""It made us look like geniuses,"" Mr. Markus said. The timing is right again. In the midst of the current drought, the county has completed a $142 million expansion that will increase capacity by more than 40 percent, to 100 million gallons a day, and at a fraction of the cost of importing water or desalinating seawater. (A further expansion to 130 million gallons a day is planned.) Now water reuse is being tried elsewhere around the country, including parched cities in Texas that do pipe treated water directly to their water supplies. Here in California, ""there are agencies considering this all over the state,"" said Jennifer West, the general manager for WateReuse California, a trade association.

In November, the San Diego City Council voted for a $2.9 billion Pure Water program to provide a third of the city's daily needs by 2035. The Santa Clara Valley Water District hopes to meet up to at least 10 percent of its water demands by 2022 with its project. And Los Angeles is ready to try again, with plans to provide a quarter of the city's needs by 2024 with recycled water and captured storm water routed through aquifers. ""The difference between this and 2000 is everyone wants this to happen,"" said Marty Adams, who heads the water system for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The inevitable squeamishness over drinking water that was once waste ignores a fundamental fact, said George Tchobanoglous, an expert in water reuse and a professor emeritus at the University of California, Davis: ""When it comes down to it, water is water,"" he said. ""Everyone who lives downstream on a river is drinking recycled water.""

The processes at Orange County and most other plants that clean the water include microfiltration that strains out anything larger than 0.2 microns, removing almost all suspended solids, bacteria and protozoa. After that comes reverse osmosis, which involves forcing the water across a membrane, which removes other impurities, including viruses, pharmaceuticals and dissolved minerals. A zap with powerful ultraviolet light and a bit of hydrogen peroxide disinfects further and neutralize other small chemical compounds. But after all that, 13 percent of adult Americans say they would absolutely refuse to even try recycled water, according to a recent study in the journal Judgment and Decision Making. ""A small minority of people are very offended by this, and can slow it down or stop it because of legal and political forces,"" said Paul Rozin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies revulsion and a co-author of the study. A cup of treated drinking water at the Orange County plant. The water is cleaner than water that flows out of a home faucet or comes in a brand-name bottle. Opponents of reusing water have long had the upper hand, said Paul Slovic, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, because of the ""branding problem."" People tend to judge risk emotionally, he said, and a phrase like ""toilet to tap"" can undercut earnest explanations. ""The water industry has not been good at marketing reuse,"" he added. But research has shown that highlighting the benefits of recycled water -- and the need -- can shift emotions to a more positive reaction and help diminish the sense of risk. The cities now considering using recycled water for drinking have watched Orange County's success carefully. San Diego and the Santa Clara Valley Water District have opened demonstration plants, and conducted tours and talks.

When the San Diego City Council voted in November to move forward with purification plans, it had the support of businesses and several environmental groups. ""We are not so naive to believe that there aren't customers who have concerns,"" said Brent Eidson, a spokesman for San Diego's Department of Public Utilities. ""But at this point we have not seen any organized opposition."" Wichita Falls and Big Spring, Tex., have put purified water directly into the drinking supply without incident. Wichita Falls has been using its system since July 2014. Russell Schreiber, the city's director of public works, said that some people have told him, ""I'm not going to drink it."" His response? ""That's great. Saves water!"" The city produces nine million gallons a day, and he said people now stop him to say, ""The water tastes better."" For the ultimate in recycled water, there is one place to go: the International Space Station. Aboard the space station, equipment captures liquid from the onboard toilets and even the moisture from breath and sweat. Col. Douglas H. Wheelock, who served as commander of the station in 2010, said, ""I drank it for six months, and it was actually quite tasty."" That did not keep his colleagues from making light of the situation, however. ""We had a running joke on the station,"" he said. ""Yesterday's coffee is tomorrow's coffee."""

Bridget Riley and Lucian Freud, two of the most significant British artists of the 20th and early 21st centuries, are each the subject of new multivolume monographs, exquisitely illustrated on stock heavy enough to be framed and mounted. But, taken together, they become a study in contrasts: Riley is a pioneer of Op Art and abstracted forms, whereas Freud, deemed by some to be the savior of figurative painting, avoided geometric forms at all costs. Riley paints the limits of people's visual perception; Freud, a portrait painter, plumbed the depths of people themselves. Riley is still at the height of her powers, having shown new work at the David Zwirner gallery in London earlier this year, to rapturous reviews; Freud painted nearly until the day he died in 2011.

""Bridget Riley: The Complete Paintings"" is a catalogue raisonne, in the literal sense of the term: a reasoned and meticulously detailed register of over 600 works, presented chronologically across thousands of pages, divided into five volumes, and accompanied by provenance descriptions and annotations (each work is assigned a ""BR number""). Having compiled more an art-historical resource than a written work of literature, the German art historian and longtime Riley chronicler Robert Kudielka describes the books in an introductory essay as a ""treasure chest"" that ""should be regarded as a basis and incitement for future investigations."" Given that Riley is listed as the primary author, the volumes should be considered as the work of a woman who is invested in shaping her legacy in the pantheon. (And furthermore, given that she is still working, it's more than likely that a sixth volume will eventually be necessary.)"

The otherworldly documentary ""Space Dogs"" begins fittingly with a story of oblivion. A narrator recounts the pioneering flight of Laika, the Muscovite street dog who orbited the Earth when the Soviets launched her into space in 1957. The camera seems to recreate her journey, floating around glowing blue. But this peacefulness derails as the narrator details Laika's cruel demise and the image begins to distort, as if the camera were making a forced re-entry. It's an impossible shot, but ""Space Dogs"" is full of visuals that seem pulled from another planet.

The filmmakers Elsa Kremser and Levin Peter twist more familiar documentary techniques as they spin a speculative legend around Laika. Starting from the conceit that her ghost has returned to earth, they follow two present-day street dogs in verite style. The voice-over gestures vaguely at cosmic connections between these dogs and Laika, but the images make a blunter impact. In the most nauseating sequence, the dogs kill a house cat and the camera lingers on every sickening squelch. The viciousness of this death hangs over the rest of the film and is matched by archival footage of Soviet scientists performing experiments on dogs that were also sent into space.

The connection between violence of the strays and the violence of the state feels tenuous. The sheer extremity of these scenes -- and their agonizing duration -- risks turning off the audience even as they are asked to connect the filmmakers' oblique conceptual dots. But ""Space Dogs"" commits to its art-house pretensions. The result isn't pleasant, but it does effectively provoke. Space Dogs

That means learning quantitative skills, business and tech.","A panel sits in judgment at a start-up competition at Michigan State, where data analytics and business acumen are part of the law school curriculum.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/education/edlife/03LAW1/LAW1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=bbec61b038d430bca53dbc1be9c60bec1a210166401c47adf9f7ddeadaa686d6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/education/edlife/socrates-takes-a-back-seat-to-business-and-tech.html,2238b45d-c07e-5db3-ac52-eacd35ceb89c.jpg,"On a spring afternoon at Michigan State University, 15 law students are presenting start-up proposals to a panel of legal scholars and entrepreneurs and an audience of fellow students. The end-of-semester event is one part seminar and one part ""Shark Tank"" reality show. The companies the students are describing would be very different from the mega-firms that many law students have traditionally aspired to work for, and to grow wealthy from. Instead, these young people are proposing businesses more nimble and offbeat: small, quick mammals scrambling underfoot in the land of dinosaurs. A few of them talk of outsourced services for larger law firms. Karen Francis-McWhite pitches one to help homesteaders claim properties for their own. Another would help immigrants file their taxes, an essential but frightening step to gaining citizenship. The tagline, delivered by its advocate, Giavanna Reeves: ""Filing taxes should not make you feel blue when you've got a green card in line."" The Entrepreneurial Lawyering Startup Competition, a showcase of the university's Reinvent Law Laboratory, is not an activity many practicing lawyers would recognize. But it might be the kind of broadened curriculum many of today's students need.

""Legal education has been stronger on tradition than innovation,"" said Joan W. Howarth, dean of the Michigan State law school. ""What we're trying to do is educate lawyers for the future, not the past."" MATTHEW RUSSO and fellow students presented ideas at Michigan State's Entrepreneurial Lawyering Startup Competition. His pitch: a one-stop shop for law and accounting services. Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times Like a number of law schools looking to the future of a challenging profession, this school is pushing its students to understand business and technology so that they can advise entrepreneurs in coming fields. The school wants them to think of themselves as potential founders of start-ups as well, and to operate fluidly in a legal environment that is being transformed by technology. Michigan State professors don't just teach torts, contracts and the intricacies of constitutional law. They also delve into software and services that sift through thousands of cases to help predict whether a client's case might be successful or what arguments could be most effective. They introduce their students to programs that search through mountains of depositions and filings, automating tasks like the dreary ""document review"" that was once the baptism of fire and boredom for young associates. One of the founders of the Reinvent Law Laboratory is Daniel Martin Katz, an associate professor with expertise in big data and powerful computing and their applications to legal studies. He hopes to give his students a leg up in a job market that seems increasingly bleak, and to help them become ""T-shaped,"" by which he means having deep knowledge -- the downward swipe of the letter T -- as well as a broadened set of abilities. So providing them with information on seemingly arcane subjects like data analytics can be a career builder. ""Analytics plus law gets you into a niche,"" he said. The program is partly funded by the Kauffman Foundation, which supports entrepreneurship education.

With the marketplace shifting, schools have increasingly come under fire for being out of touch. Catherine L. Carpenter, vice dean of Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles, tracks curriculum across the country. She said schools are trying to teach their students to run their own firms, to look for entrepreneurial opportunities by finding ""gaps in the law or gaps in the delivery of services,"" and to gain specialized knowledge that can help them counsel entrepreneurs. At Indiana University's law school, Prof. William D. Henderson has been advocating a shake-up in legal education whose time may have come. ""You have got to be in a lot of pain"" before a school will change something as tradition-bound as legal training, he said, but pain is everywhere at the moment, and ""that's kind of our opening."" He advocates putting more technology and practical training into the curriculum to adapt to a field that is less about ""expensive, artisan-trained lawyers"" and more about providing legal services at lower cost. Bill Mooz, a visiting professor at the University of Colorado law school, has started a four-week summer boot camp called Tech Lawyer Accelerator to provide, as he put it, ""all of the things they don't teach you in law school and they don't teach in law firms but which you need to be effective in today's world."" Students are brought up to speed on tech tools designed to make legal services more efficient. They hear lectures from companies like Adobe and NetApp. After the four weeks, they spend the rest of the summer, or even the following semester, working directly for a company. Mr. Mooz calls the program ""drinking from a fire hose."" DAIN BARNETT proposed Law-Spark at the competition. It would provide technical support -- developers, product designers -- to law-related tech start-ups. Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times At Northwestern Law, Daniel B. Rodriguez, the dean, is expanding clinical education while using faculty members with technical and business experience to instruct in ""the law/business/technology interface."" Law school, he said, used to be a refuge for students who ""might be math phobic, who don't do numbers."" But the practice of law increasingly requires lawyers to understand the work and strategy of their clients, whether that means reading a spreadsheet or going even further. ""That doesn't mean you need to have a Ph.D. or a master's degree in math to become a lawyer,"" Mr. Rodriguez said. ""It doesn't actually kill you, but makes you stronger, to have a background in statistics."" And, he said, ""Not to be too jargonistic, but big-data analytics have pervaded many aspects of the management world, and lawyers need to have some facility with that.""

The Northwestern program stresses teamwork, though the lecture format is still a big part of the program. He noted, with a reference to the law school classic ""The Paper Chase,"" that ""Kingsfield hasn't gone away."" These programs might be especially important for schools that aren't in the top education tier, to combat the ""very elitist"" attitudes of the legal employment market, said Brian Z. Tamanaha, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""Will it be enough for them to pick the M.S.U. grad over the Michigan grad, to name a local competitor? That remains to be seen."" Another skeptical law professor, Paul F. Campos of the University of Colorado, said he finds Michigan State's approach ""admirable"" but declared himself amused by the focus on tech. ""The irony here is that these new technologies are destroying traditional legal jobs!"" KACIE KEFGEN suggested a service to help develop playbooks for education administrators, who have to make tough decisions with legal consequences, often without time to consult a lawyer. Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times Mr. Campos's blog, Inside the Law School Scam, was harshly critical of legal education. (He discontinued it last year, writing: ""I've said what I have to say, at least in this format."") Now, he says, ""The fundamental problem remains that we're putting out way, way too many lawyers -- or, should I say, people with law degrees, given the number of entry-level jobs."" For the students at Michigan State, the opportunities outweigh the risks. While none are likely to become expert programmers, they believe their training will get them a job at firms that need someone who can communicate with the geek contractors. ""This is the worst time in the history of legal education to go to law school,"" said Patrick Ellis, a recent graduate. ""I am not top of my class, not at a top-10 law school, but I'm confident I'm going to have a meaningful career because of this program.""

The winner of the start-up competition at Michigan State was Stand'n, a blend of social media's friend-tracking features and apps to connect people and firms with legal services on short notice. The student behind the idea, Andrew Johnston, called it ""kind of like an Uber for lawyers."" Law firms, he explained, could use the service when they need an attorney to fill in for them at routine court appearances and depositions. The idea brought him $2,000 from the judges. After the competition, Mr. Johnston told me he had not heard of Lawyers on Call, a company that already provides such services, though not with an app. He was not deterred. He asked the name again, and wrote it down. Dean Howarth said she had bumped into one of her more conventional law school colleagues who had seen the gathering and wondered if it was that law school staple, the moot court competition.

42759,"In Los Angeles, a Restaurant Equal Parts California and Middle East","The intense, surprising flavors at Kismet put an emphasis on the fresh, the bold and the bright.","At Kismet in Los Angeles, aromatic freekeh fritters are deep fried and come with a pickle-y green sauce.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/11/travel/11BITES/11BITES-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a2356384eb96a1d52cf230cde6515d587eb241f907ec3f60796c51e1ea14e08b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/travel/kismet-restaurant-los-angeles-review.html,ab750e69-9b68-5e58-bfca-92a6e7cdba52.jpg,"It is surprising that in Los Angeles, where one lucky break can be the difference between obsolescence and global stardom, that there was not already a restaurant called Kismet. The word is a whimsical synonym for fate, the unpredictable forces that lead people to their destiny. The co-chefs Sara Kramer and Sarah Hymanson thought it was so perfect a name for their new Los Feliz spot that at first they could not believe it was available. ""It is a Middle Eastern word, and we are making Californian food inspired by the Middle East,"" Ms. Kramer said. ""It means chance, and we took a chance coming out to Los Angeles.""

Kismet opened in January, with a bubble-gum-pink neon sign and decor that is almost Scandinavian in its simplicity. The food, by contrast, is some of the most colorful cuisine you can find on the East Side. (The people-watching isn't drab either: The night my partner and I were there, the place was crowded with young, dewy Angelenos clad in playful Dusen Dusen jumpsuits and neon silk athleisure.)

Ms. Kramer and Ms. Hymanson, who met slinging nutty hummus and pillowy pitas at Glasserie in Brooklyn and then migrated to Los Angeles with a restaurant called Madcapra in the Grand Central Market, have brought their love of intense, surprising Middle Eastern flavors to Kismet, putting an emphasis on the fresh, the bold and the bright: a tart and colorful salad of marinated kohlrabi with pumpkin seeds, kumquats and barberries, for example.

The restaurant's signature dish is jeweled crispy rice, a sizzling cake of saffron-yellow grain fried to a crunch, its golden shell hiding a wobbly egg yolk that oozes from the middle with one hard whack from a spoon. It's a playfully interactive dish that prompts conversations between tables. The menu is vegetable-heavy, with a focus on small, shareable bites."
33719,Why Do Kids' Books About Black Hair Draw So Much Attention — and Controversy?,"I set out to write a warm, whimsical book about a black girl's hair. Twenty years on, that's still a powerful subject.","From ""I Love My Hair!""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/17/books/review/17Tarpley-01/17Tarpley-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5dafddc617f9eadda96576006e5c83745a4c66bf2cd2e0522a5de927ae98934f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/books/review/i-love-my-black-hair-natasha-tarpley.html,6d26b5aa-7030-5a30-9223-7a8bdeb7b692.jpg,"When I was a little girl, I loved the moments I spent with my mom as she did my hair -- not so much getting my hair combed, but the ritual around the process, and the magic we created out of it. First, the banishment of annoying siblings to another part of the house. Then, the gathering of materials: a turquoise wide-tooth comb and brush set, an assortment of candy-colored barrettes, and the jar of blue Ultra Sheen hair grease, a small cup of solidified ocean that bore the swirling imprint, like fossilized waves, of dipping fingers. Finally, there were the stories. We pretended there were people who lived in my hair, and as she combed each section, we'd ""visit"" our regular cast of characters -- usually based on real-life friends and relatives -- creating elaborate story lines about the goings-on in their lives. Sitting between my mother's knees I could be and do anything. I felt powerful.

As I got older, I became aware that as an African-American girl, I saw myself very differently from how others saw me. Kids teased me about my weight, my clothes and my hair, which I began to wear straightened in an attempt to fit in, but which never seemed comfortable on top of my head (I was the girl with the lopsided ""mushroom,"" or the frizzy edges that I sweated out during gym class). Suddenly, the voices of the people in my hair were quiet. My hair had lost its magic, and, I felt, so had I.

Books were my anchors whenever I questioned myself, my attractiveness, my magic. Yet even in the pages that became my solace, I rarely saw images of black kids like me -- weird, ""quirky"" and shy -- who just got to be regular kids, grappling with everyday kid stuff. Much later, when I decided to write a children's book, hair seemed like a natural subject, inspired by the special time I shared with my mom as she combed my hair, which had awakened my love of storytelling. But I also wanted to expand the kinds of stories told about African-American kids. The result was ""I Love My Hair!,"" a story about an African-American girl who uses vivid imagery to celebrate the ways she wears her hair, published in 1998 and now being reissued on its 20th anniversary.

Back then mainstream publishers were starting to pay attention to what was called ""multiculturalism,"" the precursor of today's diverse books movement. Yet I still felt stories about black kids were narrow, either historical or focused on trauma or the ills of urban communities. In ""I Love My Hair!"" I sought to create a whimsical story that encouraged kids not only to love their hair, but also to explore and find joy in their own imaginations."
8512,French Soccer's Renegade President Would Like a Word. With Everyone.,"As French soccer closed down, one club executive complained the loudest. Now, as other European soccer leagues have resumed, Jean-Michel Aulas is doubling down.","Lyon's Jean-Michel Aulas is rarely short of opinions, and never shy about sharing his.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/sports/27soccer-lyon/27soccer-lyon-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8634e14d6751ec869b58b5225f83530bebb45b72abb3a978dc1f215e976dc1d5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/sports/soccer/lyon-aulas-ligue-1.html,b4377696-17d7-50db-b69d-426ce60e39ab.jpg,"Jean-Michel Aulas has been watching a lot of soccer in recent weeks. His emotions have been mixed. On the one hand, Aulas, the president of the French club Olympique Lyonnais, loves the sport. And even though games across Europe are being played against the surreal and sterile backdrop of fan-free stadiums, he says he cannot get enough of it. On the other hand, with each passing game, with each passing week that soccer's return from its monthslong pandemic pause passes without incident, Aulas's fury has mounted. For weeks, Aulas, 71, had been the loudest voice -- and at times the only voice -- pressing for the French league to stay the course, to not be so hasty in declaring its season over while other leagues across Europe were still plotting ways to resume their schedules. Aulas did not get his way. As early as April 30, officials from France's top league voted to rubber-stamp an announcement that the country's prime minister, Edouard Philippe, had made in Parliament days earlier that effectively ended the season. Aulas then failed to successfully appeal the decision in court.

Aulas is well known in France for speaking his mind -- he used to use Twitter to try to lure top women's players to sign with Lyon -- and ever since losing the fight over the season he has lashed out at everyone from government officials to league administrators to rival executives. He has issued withering put-downs and he has lectured them about what he views as a huge blunder, one with ramifications that he contends will be long lasting, and deeply damaging, to French soccer. The word ""stupid"" was invoked. Read More on the Coronavirus Pandemic

His team, a regular Champions League competitor, one that had played in Europe for 23 consecutive years, will be perhaps the hardest hit by Ligue 1's decision to end the season. When the season stopped, Lyon was in seventh place, outside of the European places for next season.

Aulas's fiery remarks have created damaging fissures with other leading figures in French soccer, including Caiazzo and Didier Quillot, the chief executive of Ligue 1, which is known as L.F.P. Quillot declined to discuss Aulas. ""L.F.P. management has decided to work instead of speaking,"" he said in an email provided by a league spokesman. Caiazzo, who sits on the board of the Ligue 1, suggested Aulas was trying to rewrite history. The comments by Philippe, the prime minister, in Parliament on April 28, in which he declared the season over, had set off a chain reaction, Caiazzo said. Within hours, the president of France's soccer federation declared amateur and professional soccer over, and the top division's main television partner announced it would cancel the remainder of its contract. Then came the league's board meeting. ""At this time there were 1,000 deaths per day,"" Caiazzo said. ""Do you think somebody will put their hand up and say, ""Sorry, I don't think we will stop.' We would have been outlaws."" The league, in Aulas's view, panicked. He said he was actually defending France's interests when he argued against ending the season; the league, he said, now risks punishment by European soccer's governing body for not trying to finish its campaign. And events in the weeks and months that have followed do appear to support at least some of Aulas's claims. France's sports minister, Roxana Maracineanu, surprised many recently when she suggested it was ultimately the league's call to end the season, and UEFA's president, Aleksander Ceferin, has described the decision as ""premature."" The easing of restrictions in France, where shops and restaurants have gradually started to reopen, along with the resumption of play in Europe's other top leagues, have made French soccer's decision the exception rather than the rule.

""I publicly said that this is a mistake, and a big misunderstanding of the real situation, so I was alone to express myself, yes,"" Aulas said. ""Often in France people who speak out are right, but are often only seen to be right after it is too late."" French clubs continue to add up the costs of the season's early end. The government has backed a loan of 225 million euros (just over $250 million) to replace the amount television companies would have paid for the remainder of the season, but talks continue over how it might help teams cover losses like lost ticket and sponsorship revenues. Estimates of those costs vary; French soccer's financial body estimated next season's deficit might be as high as 1.1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, before accounting for player trading income. Set against that bleak backdrop, clubs in France are certain to see their values tumble, and for bargain hunters hoping to take advantage of the grim financial situation, to start to circle. Aulas expects prices, both for clubs and for the players that are their most valuable assets, to plummet. ""I think the way things have been managed has really destroyed French football,"" he said.

In Aulas's mind, as the virus raged in April, France's government alighted on the soccer industry to make a point, to demonstrate it was acting decisively to tackle a virus that had been devastating the country. In short, he said, the decision to end the season was a piece of theater. ""They have used football as a political tool in the middle of this public health crisis of coronavirus, and I have to admit this is a shame for football people,"" he said. For now, Aulas can do little except continue to watch soccer on television, and continue to fume. The club's legal battles will go on, he said. And Aulas is sure to keep insisting that he was right."
21591,Fleeing Racist America at the End of the 19th Century for a More Tolerant France,"In Christopher Tilghman's novel ""Thomas and Beal in the Midi"" a mixed-race couple leave Maryland to try to find themselves in the south of France.",Christopher Tilghman,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/02/books/review/Upchurch01/Upchurch01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=35797b38e36a6144df1693db7e16016dc000fff1b87da5dd2f1c2a9fb36d4595&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/books/review/christopher-tilghman-thomas-and-beal-in-the-midi.html,db24e817-73fd-59b5-8a45-fcd98401cbe6.jpg,"The fallout from their expatriation affects them differently. ""What Beal had given up -- the love of a family -- Thomas had never had; what Thomas had given up -- family wealth -- Beal couldn't imagine."" Still, their connection feels strangely tepid. It's as if they fled to France to try out a relationship, rather than protect an existing passion from bigotries that would like to see it destroyed. The last thing they are is wrapped up in each other -- an odd state of affairs for a newlywed couple.

Something seems to be missing from this account of their romance -- and the place to look for it is Tilghman's fine 2012 novel, ""The Right-Hand Shore"" (his prequel to ""Mason's Retreat,"" the 1996 novel that made his name). ""The Right-Hand Shore"" steeps us in the childhoods and adolescence of Thomas, Beal and Beal's brilliant brother, Randall, who condemned the couple's relationship. The new novel alludes to this conflict and other crucial elements in the pair's background without quite making them palpable. Readers coming to ""Thomas and Beal in the Midi"" without taking in the earlier novel -- as I did, before I realized I needed to backtrack -- will find Beal an emotional blank canvas whose main attribute is her unusual beauty.

This seems deliberate on Tilghman's part. Even Beal appears puzzled by her own personality. ""Who am I?"" she asks. ""What have I done so far and why did I do it?""

The adroitly drawn secondary characters in ""Thomas and Beal in the Midi"" have a sharper, more satisfying edge. They include the nun who helps the newlyweds settle in France; a moody Jewish artist from Newark who paints Beal's portrait in his dingy Paris studio; a spirited young Irishwoman who steers Thomas toward becoming a winemaker and is obviously smitten with him; and two insistent men who think Beal should simply forsake her marriage and run off with them. One is a proud Senegalese diplomat who would like to make Beal one of his wives; the other is a prosperous African-American retailer from Boston. As for Thomas, he's a curious study in passive encouragement, aware of how Beal has become distracted from her marriage, but willing to wait until she drifts back to him.

The quality of Tilghman's prose fluctuates, sometimes feeling too contemporary to evoke fin de siecle France, while at other times nailing ambiguities of character nicely. ""It was either,"" Thomas reflects on his love for Beal, ""an act of courage or of cowardice, a supreme show of strength or a pathetic display of weakness, but it belonged only to him."""

A Chinese philosopher once said that exploration was a form of play. So it is fitting that the early artifacts of the Apollo moon landings, the grandest feat of exploration ever attempted, resemble nothing so much as toys. They are expressions in miniature of giant aspirations, reminders of how engineers play and imagine the future.

Naturally, toy spaceships wouldn't be complete without little lunar landscapes to place them on, or astronaut dolls to ride in them. But these toys had a serious purpose. For protection against the rigors of high Gs during launch and re-entry, test pilots and astronauts sat on couches that were custom-made to fit their bodies. Lined up, the molds for the couches look for all the world as if the pilots have assumed the position for a spanking.

At the time, nobody knew what it would be like to walk in a spacesuit in the trampoline-like low gravity of the moon, or to drive the trackless wastes of lunar grit and boulders. The space age was young, and we were kids with a cosmic gleam in our eyes."
56418,The Uncanny Charms of Naïve Simplicity,"Mark Morris's company presented the premiere of his work ""Words,"" set to music by Mendelssohn, at the Fall for Dance Festival at City Center.","Rita Donahue, center, and other members of Mark Morris's troupe in ""Words,"" at City Center as part of Fall for Dance.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/10/arts/10FALLDANCE/FALLDANCE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=398&w=600&s=39472159e95688b0dde19653c9a3322ce541d84b94d0e4df173d128992de625b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/arts/dance/mark-morriss-words-a-premiere-at-fall-for-dance.html,8978a20a-ccf8-5cec-b13e-41b3d156ff79.jpg,"Fall for Dance, one of New York's hallowed institutions, is always the same and always different. Each fall brings a two-week season at City Center; each season brings five new programs; each program has four different items; each evening covers several genres; and the sum of the parts illustrates dance's diversity. The atmosphere is invariably buzzy and happy; the audience greets each piece warmly. But not all Fall for Dance programs contain a Mark Morris world premiere; on Wednesday, this year's opening night did. The music is to 10 of Mendelssohn's 48 ""Songs Without Words,"" all very charming, covering diverse moods; the title, ""Words,"" might lead you to expect some of Mr. Morris's mime gestures or expressionistic motifs. In the work, however, the dances show us how much the choreographer can do with a simple, near-pedestrian dance vocabulary and a phenomenally diverse grasp of basic dance musicality. Some of the ""Songs Without Words"" are given in Mendelssohn's original piano setting, others in an arrangement by Friedrich Herrmann for piano and violin. Colin Fowler, pianist, and Georgy Valtchev, violinist, were the admirable musicians. Even to a simple three-quarter tempo, Mr. Morris shows how many different ways he can accentuate the meter, and how many structural variations he can make on simple choreographic formats. ""Words"" leaves an overall impression of complete charm and canny organization. This presentation is for 16 dancers. But the company, splitting into two for simultaneous tours, will also present reduced-cast versions. Throughout, Mr. Morris uses a traditional ""wipe"" device, where dancers enter with a small curtain that helps to introduce performers hidden behind it or to hide those who now depart.

Everywhere, the phrasing is musically judicious: a mixture of regular and irregular. We keep thinking we can see what will happen, then find we are wrong. Near the end, a violin trill cues the dancers to rotate on the spot, with arms outstretched (Aaron Loux, the company's most enthusiastic, alert and witty dancer, does this marvelously), and we think we've spotted one of Mr. Morris's Mickey Mouse motifs. Yet next, the dancers rotate again to a nontrill, descending line in the music -- and it's equally satisfying. Another fascination throughout is how close to nondance vocabulary Mr. Morris stays. There are balances and turns most of us couldn't do, but they're delivered the opposite way from virtuosity: They either look perilous (we see the effort) or childishly innocent (those spins look newly minted). Generally, the material is simple; it never draws our attention to technique. Since the 1980s, Mr. Morris has been using the ""democratic dance"" idea that emerged with the early postmodernists of Judson Church in New York; but whereas so many choreographers still seem infantilized by Judson precepts, Mr. Morris rediscovers the wonderful naivete in such movement and makes us feel that everything here is happening for the first time. This program opened with two numbers performed by Black Grace, a group that (to quote the program note) ""fuses Western contemporary dance with the traditional Samoan dance style known as Fa'ataupati (or slap dance) as a means of exploring cultural identity."" This is a feat of metric intricacy. The dancers -- six men in ""Minoi"" (bare-chested in sarongs), joined by four women in ""Pati Pati"" -- create sounds by chanting, emitting isolated vowels, clapping hands or slapping their thighs or calves or the floor. Meanwhile, they kneel, stand, tip, arch, gesture.

The coordination is phenomenal. Early in ""Minoi,"" the men create a dazzling effect simply by the suddenness with which they turn their heads to follow the direction of their raised right arms. It feels as if they're dislocating their necks, but it's achieved simply by very spruce timing. Mainly the phrases are short, but there are scarcely any pauses; and the meter keeps changing, so that they're never locked in a rhythmic continuum. The dancers move in various geometries: A favorite is a triangular wedge pattern that organizes them to move in three or four horizontal rows, each with its own brilliant routine. The command of dynamics is so brilliant that a quick series of vertically rising hand claps, phrased as a diminuendo, becomes enchanting. Entirely less spellbinding were the program's two other works, Hans van Manen's ""Variations for Two Couples"" (performed by San Francisco Ballet) and Russell Maliphant's ""Two x Two."" Mr. van Manen is a veteran of the European ballet scene. At several points, I admired the sheer intelligence of incidental features in ""Variations""; though the two women (Sofiane Sylve, Vanessa Zahorian) are mainly partnered by the two men (Luke Ingham, Carlos Quenedit), sometimes it is they who revolve the men. One woman is promenaded full circle with her leg extended high past shoulder height. Mr. van Manen's cleverness includes a way of showing us how he connects to rhythmic details of his music (a taped series of all string pieces) while ignoring other aspects. Chilly, slick stuff. There's little to say of the British Mr. Maliphant's ""Two x Two."" Fang-Yi Sheu and Yuan Yuan Tan, dancers well known in the United States (Ms. Tan is another San Francisco ballerina), moved barefoot in bland gyrations in separate squares of light, largely synchronized, to taped percussive music by Andy Cowton. When Fall for Dance's taste is so admirably eclectic, why does it include cliches like this?"

VIENNA -- Last Monday in the imposing Ephrussi Palace, Edmund de Waal presided over a family reunion. For the first time since World War II, 41 relatives from around Europe, the United States and Mexico toured the neo-Renaissance building that had been home to the Ephrussi family, European Jews whose wealth once rivaled that of the Rothschilds. ""It's not just a nice family gathering -- it's a political act,"" said Mr. de Waal in an interview the next day. Mr. De Waal, a British ceramic artist and best-selling author, is the great-grandson of Viktor von Ephrussi, who thrived in Vienna as a banker before fleeing the city after Hitler's 1938 incorporation of Austria into the Third Reich. On Tuesday, the country's president, Alexander Van der Bellen, welcomed the family to an exhibition opening nearby that tells their story. ""The Ephrussis: Travel in Time,"" at the Jewish Museum Vienna through March 8, presents the family's history through documents, photographs and souvenirs that Mr. de Waal donated to the museum last year. But the stars of the show are 157 netsuke (pronounced NET-ske), tiny Japanese carvings in wood and ivory, made famous by Mr. de Waal's 2010 memoir, ""The Hare With Amber Eyes."" The book, which takes its name from one of the figures, tells the story of the collection and the family, which survived World War II by spreading out into a worldwide diaspora.

""Even though I love this collection, the story has more resonance here in Vienna,"" Mr. de Waal said. The figures' presence in the city, he added, would help tell the story ""of not just anti-Semitism and racism, but polarization, and treatment of exiles, and migration."" Since 2015, Austria has welcomed more than a million refugees and migrants who transited through the European Union's unguarded borders, mostly fleeing conflict in the Middle East. Only a small fraction settled in the country, but their arrival was followed by an acrimonious debate and loud protests from the far right. Austria's government, led by conservatives, soon demanded the strengthening of Europe's external borders.

Charles Ephrussi was an art collector in 19th-century Paris and patron of artists including Renoir, who featured the connoisseur in the back of his famous painting ""Luncheon of the Boating Party."" The collector bought the netsuke in the 1870s, and sent them to Vienna as a wedding present to his cousin, Mr. de Waal's great-grandfather. ""The Hare With Amber Eyes"" tells how, in 1938, when the Nazis seized the Ephrussis' art collection, a maid managed to hide the netsuke away, handful by handful, in her apron. They survived the war and were among the first items the Ephrussis managed to recover. At the Jewish Museum, the netsuke are shown in glass cases throughout the exhibition, linking rooms organized along the Ephrussis' journey from Odessa, in today's Ukraine, where their ancestors made their fortune in the grain trade, to Vienna, Paris, London and beyond. The figures were intended to be handled, and each of them bears wear and tear from generations of admirers.

Also on show are artifacts, like the Renoir painting, that show how Jews rose in prominence in 19th-century Europe. Others, like a satirical newspaper illustration from the time of the Dreyfus Affair in France, record rising anti-Semitism on the Continent. The exhibition also tells how those who survived war and persecution remade their lives in the second half of the 20th century. (The line of inheritance brought the netsuke back to their native Japan, where Mr. de Waal's great-uncle held them until his death in 1997, when they passed to Mr. de Waal in London.) Danielle Spera, the director of the Jewish Museum, said the exhibition was a chance to reopen a chapter of history. ""It's really important to bring back into the minds of the Viennese and Austrian people what happened to this family,"" she said in an interview. The mission of the museum, she added, was to raise awareness so that no one is persecuted like this again.

""If you measure a story entirely through loss, what you're doing is you're not paying attention to the lived lives of the people in the story,"" Mr. de Waal said. ""It's a much more interesting and complex story about how people remake their lives."" Although ""The Hare With Amber Eyes"" reached a wider public than Mr. De Waal's ceramic work, he is above all a visual artist. His delicate, minimalist porcelain vessels take the form everyday objects, like vases or teapots, and often include lines of poetry printed on the porcelain. An exhibition or Mr. De Waal's vessels is on display at the Frick Collection in New York through Nov. 17. In recent years, Mr. De Waal's art and writing have taken on an increasingly political tone. In 2016, at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Mr. De Waal selected artwork around the theme of anxiety from the museum's collections for an exhibition called ""During the Night."" The result was a pitch-dark show that reflected his anxiety about political events in the year when Britain voted to leave the European Union and the bloc clamped down on migration. During this year's Venice Biennale, Mr. De Waal showed a ""Library of Exile,"" made up of 2,000 books written by refugees and displaced people. The show will travel to Dresden, Germany and London next year. After its run in Vienna, the Ephrussi exhibition will move on to the Jewish Museum in New York, and then to San Francisco.

The transition to pop has been happening for years. But the big news at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, is that for the first time skaters can use music with lyrics, a rule change by the International Skating Union meant to attract a younger audience.

The appearance of more recognizable pop -- the first Olympic competition last week included Ed Sheeran, an Oasis cover and ""Dust in the Wind"" -- has led to questions from viewers about how musicians are compensated, and how the skaters secure permission to use songs. As with everything related to music copyright, the answer is complicated. But the basic rule is simple: Standard licensing fees paid by broadcasters cover these uses, and the money makes its way, eventually, to songwriters as royalties.

Most of the time, when songs are included on television, producers have to pay for a so-called synchronization license from music publishers. Negotiations can lead to high fees for the most in-demand pieces, like Beatles songs."

As Apple reported revenue and profit increases that beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, the company said it was also seeing strong demand for the iPhone X, as well as for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which it unveiled in September.

Apple said it expected revenue for the holiday quarter, which is typically its most robust, to come in at between $84 billion and $87 billion. That forecast was well above the $78.4 billion that Apple generated during last year's holiday quarter, which was an all-time high for quarterly revenue, and reflected confidence that people want new iPhones.

Ideally, teachers will provide lessons, whether online or on paper, to help meet children's academic needs, but school also fills physical and social needs. Answering the following questions can help parents ease the transition and help children (temporarily) join the 1.7 million American students who are home-schooled. [For younger children whose schools are closed, advice from NYT Parenting.] Will an Adult Be Around? Many companies are offering employees the option of working from home or explicitly telling them to do so, so some parents may find themselves at home with their kids, trying to figure out new ways to navigate their own workdays as well as their children's. For those who must work outside the home, unless you can arrange for a nanny there are few options but to ask friends or relatives for help. There are no consistent standards as to what is the right age to leave a child home alone. In the few states that have laws, the range is wide: Illinois, 14 years old; Maryland, 8 years old; and Oregon, 10 years old.

It's important to know how much responsibility your child can handle: Children who can safely make themselves a meal and care for pets can most likely look after themselves for the span of a school day. Parents should provide emergency contacts and check in regularly; if an older child has to be responsible for a younger sibling, try to ensure that they are keeping the peace and are able to get their work done. Do You Have a Schedule? ""It's important kids don't see this as an indefinite snow day,"" said Dr. Michael Rich, director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Harvard Medical School. School-age children can learn to school themselves, as long as a caregiver has set the groundwork to help them succeed. More on U.S. Schools and Education

While the pandemic has created an urgent search for teachers in some areas, not every district is suffering from shortages. Here are the factors in play At home, there are no bells ringing to tell students when it's time for their next class. But apportioning time and sticking to plans are valuable life skills kids can learn while school is canceled. Dr. Rich believes families can take advantage of the change in the schooling environment. ""I see this as an opportunity to help kids become more self-regulated,"" he said. These school closings may last longer than weather-related ones, necessitating a new mind-set that learning doesn't stop because kids are not at a traditional school.

Explaining the current crisis and the challenges it presents while enlisting children's help in making the best of a bad situation is important. The first step is to make a daily schedule. For the past five years, my home-schooled daughter, now 11, has kept a three-ring binder with a daily schedule per page. Every week, she holds time for her online classes, study time, reading, leisure time and household chores, like cleaning her fish tank. She insists that planning is key. ""I have a color-coded planner so I know exactly what to do at what time. If I didn't have a plan I'd think, 'Well, should I work on this or should I work on that?'"" Home-schooling does not necessarily mean that the parent is the teacher. Enrico Bertini, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at New York University, relies on technology to help home-school his 12-year-old son. Dr. Bertini uses a mix of free and paid sites like Outschool.com, ProdigyGame.com and KhanAcademy.org to give his son a full roster of classes. While many traditional schools provide students with access to online education during a shutdown, supplementing with other tools can help kids explore interests they don't have time for during the school year. Home-schooling allowed my daughter to go deep into topics like forensic anthropology by learning from an expert online. Platforms like Outschool.com let families select highly rated teachers more likely to keep kids engaged as they learn. One more plus: Unlike in-person school where one rambunctious child can disrupt an entire class, teachers online can mute the unruly child and turn off their camera with one click. As for concerns about screen time, research suggests that the quality of the interaction makes a difference. Using tech to create, rather than to passively consume, can encourage creativity and problem solving, but a balanced mix of tech and non-tech activities is best.

If being outdoors is a safe option, fit in time for running, hikes or bike rides. But if it isn't, it's possible for kids to stay active even when indoors. When my daughter can't go outside, she gets her exercise playing games like Just Dance Now on her laptop. Using an old Android phone, she holds the phone in one hand as she mimics the dance moves on her screen. The phone registers how well she moves to the beat as she works up a sweat. Anya Kamenetz, an education blogger at NPR, author of ""The Art of Screen Time,"" and mother of two living in Brooklyn, is making tentative plans in case the New York City public schools shut down. She says her two girls, 3 and 8, will stay active at home by using sites like GoNoodle.com which provides at-home exercise programs. For no-cost options, she recommends child-friendly aerobic workouts or yoga poses with the YouTube kids app. And you can always play freeze dance or try a situp challenge. Are They Being Social the Right Way? Kids need to interact with their peers, but how can children play without potentially spreading disease? Social media sites provide a place to engage online, but many parents are concerned about children overusing social media and worry about potential bullying online. Companies like Snapchat, TikTok and Facebook (which owns WhatsApp and Instagram), set a minimum age of 13 to use their services. Ms. Kamenetz recommends that if parents allow their children to use these services, they use them together. ""It's totally appropriate for you to be looking over their shoulders and helping them if they don't like the way their interaction is going."" Getting off social media and using video calling through Skype or FaceTime can keep kids connected to their friends and family one-on-one. She also recommends other online experiences which may not look like social sites but provide for the same need for camaraderie. ""I think a shared Minecraft server, for example,"" where a private option allows kids to play only with people they know, ""could be an awesome solution for kids."" As long as games are played in planned durations, online games with friends can be a healthy place for children to play in the virtual world when they can't play together in the real world.

8996,7 Takeaways From Mary Trump's Book About Her Uncle Donald,"Growing up Trump wasn't easy. There were feuds, grudges and spanking with a wooden spoon.

That doesn't mean they had no opinions. The daughter of the president's older brother, Freddy, who died in 1981, now shares some of hers -- not just by airing the family's dirty laundry, but by washing and folding it, too. (Mary Trump is a clinical psychologist whose diagnoses for her uncle are as varied and extensive as the fast food buffet he offered the Clemson Tigers when they visited the White House in 2019.)

[ Read Jennifer Szalai's review of ""Too Much and Never Enough."" ]

Here are seven insights gleaned from reading the first niece.

Nothing Donald Trump said during his campaign deviated from Mary Trump's expectations of him.

""I was reminded of every family meal I'd ever attended during which Donald had talked about all of the women he considered ugly fat slobs or the men, usually more accomplished or powerful, he called losers,"" she writes. ""That kind of casual dehumanization of people was commonplace at the Trump dinner table.""

The author declined an invitation to an election night party in New York City.

Her reason: ""I wouldn't be able to contain my euphoria when Clinton's victory was announced, and I didn't want to be rude."" In the months following her uncle's inauguration, ""the smallest thing -- seeing Donald's face or hearing my own name, both of which happened dozens of times a day -- took me back to the time when my father had withered and died beneath the cruelty and contempt of my grandfather. I had lost him when he was only 42 and I was 16. The horror of Donald's cruelty was being magnified by the fact that his acts were now official U.S. policy, affecting millions of people."""
4757,"The Passover Rules Bend, if Just for One Pandemic","During the holiday, many observant Jews get rid of bread and beans, pasta and rice.

But, in an untimely coincidence, some Jews do not eat those foods during Passover, which starts Wednesday at sundown. Many are caught in a quandary: A pandemic pantry does limit potentially dangerous trips to the grocery store, but its contents are against tradition. ""There definitely is a cadre of people that are saying, 'We don't know how long this quarantine is going to last,'"" said Rabbi Hara Person, the chief executive of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis in the United States and Canada. ""'We don't know what food supplies are going to be, and so we don't want to give our food away.'"" ""Passover has turned into a feast, in a typical year,"" Rabbi Hara Person said, speaking about a typical year. ""But if you really think about what the core of what Passover is about, it's not a cooking contest."" Lyndon French for The New York Times The holiday is a celebration of the Jewish people's exodus from slavery in Egypt. In preparation, some people remove all leavened foods, or ""chametz,"" from their home, often by eating it or donating to people in need. (In certain communities, some of the last remaining morsels are burned.) Others keep some of it in their home, but sell it to a non-Jewish person, transferring ownership under Jewish law. With a wink and a nod, it's theirs to reclaim when Passover ends.

In Zichron Yaakov, a town in Israel north of Tel Aviv, Jewish residents often sell their chametz to Christian neighbors. After one sale, a buyer joked with Rabbi Yair Silverman, a founder of the Moed community, that he might actually keep the food this year if he is running short on supplies. ""That's great,"" Rabbi Silverman said. ""Then it's a real sale."" This year, Chabad.org has seen an increase in people using its online platform to sell their chametz, to an estimated 250,000 sales from about 90,000 in 2019. Normally, this transaction is often carried out in person because it's ""contractual,"" like closing a house, said Rabbi Eitan Rubin, of Great Neck, N.Y. Read More on the Coronavirus Pandemic

Many Ashkenazi Jews, whose ancestors came from Europe, also do not eat ""kitniyot,"" which includes most legumes, corn and rice.

""We always followed the Ashkenazi tradition,"" said Rachel Ringler, 64, a food writer and challah-baking instructor, who will be hosting her Seder over Zoom from Bridgehampton, N.Y., instead of with 30 people in her Manhattan apartment. ""We never had rice. We never had lentils. We never even served string beans."" But she has a son-in-law who is half-Syrian, so she follows different Passover customs. ""I said, 'We are all Syrian this year,' "" she said, laughing. ""We are stocked with lentils, and so we are going to use those lentils for Passover."" The Rabbinical Assembly, the international association of Conservative rabbis, has sanctioned eating kitniyot during Passover since 2015. The custom is widespread among Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews with ancestors from Spain, North Africa and the Middle East. In Israel, many follow suit. This year, the assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards also offered alternatives for traditional foods on a Seder plate: a roasted beet and rice in place of a shank bone and egg, and any vegetable or fruit ""that can bring a tear to the eye"" if horseradish isn't available. The substitutions won't be the only thing different on the first night of Passover, which is usually celebrated with a large communal meal with family and friends. Some families who cannot be in the same house plan to cook from the same recipes, as if they were together. Self-isolating in various homes across the country, some observant Jews might need to embrace technology -- normally a no-no -- so they can celebrate together. (In Israel, which tightened travel restrictions specifically around the holiday, some are gathering before sundown to celebrate together via Skype or Zoom.) ""We've seen rabbis across the board -- but especially in the Orthodox community -- lowering the bar for Passover,"" said Mishael Zion, an Orthodox rabbi who with his father, Noam, wrote ""A Night to Remember,"" the popular modern version of the Haggadah, the text that guides the Seder. This year, he said, ""it's like the matzo, which is just the basics of bread, water and flour.""

One ritual, burning chametz, has also been discouraged. Leaders of the Orthodox community in the United States have released a joint statement noting that without a controlled, communal fire, it can be risky, and overtax emergency responders. (In the past, some fires have gotten out of hand and caused injuries.) Participating in a Seder is the most widely observed Jewish holiday custom in the United States, according to a 2013 survey from the Pew Research Center. But this year, even more Americans are expected to host their own Seders, because they can't gather with neighbors and friends, said Motti Seligson, a spokesman for Chabad. He said the organization had prepared nearly 250,000 Seder to-go kits -- packages with matzo and other holiday foods -- to distribute nationwide.

This year, many Jews are reframing how they celebrate. Instead of kosher-for-Passover macaroons, they're embracing scarcity. Instead of eight pounds of brisket, they may roast a chicken. As in biblical times, staying home is not a form of passivity; it's a way to protect a community from harm. For Rabbi Zion, a co-writer of the popular Haggadah, the essence of Passover has long been about something deeper than dietary rules. ""In this moment of darkness and doubt,"" he said, ""we need that 'next year in Jerusalem' hope more than ever."""

The Fed has worked for decades to suppress inflation, but economists, including Janet Yellen, President Obama's nominee to lead the Fed starting next year, have long argued that a little inflation is particularly valuable when the economy is weak. Rising prices help companies increase profits; rising wages help borrowers repay debts. Inflation also encourages people and businesses to borrow money and spend it more quickly. The school board in Anchorage, Alaska, for example, is counting on inflation to keep a lid on teachers' wages. Retailers including Costco and Walmart are hoping for higher inflation to increase profits. The federal government expects inflation to ease the burden of its debts. Yet by one measure, inflation rose at an annual pace of 1.2 percent in August, just above the lowest pace on record.

""Weighed against the political, social and economic risks of continued slow growth after a once-in-a-century financial crisis, a sustained burst of moderate inflation is not something to worry about,"" Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist, wrote recently. ""It should be embraced."" The Fed, in a break from its historic focus on suppressing inflation, has tried since the financial crisis to keep prices rising about 2 percent a year. Some Fed officials cite the slower pace of inflation as a reason, alongside reducing unemployment, to continue the central bank's stimulus campaign. Critics, including Professor Rogoff, say the Fed is being much too meek. He says that inflation should be pushed as high as 6 percent a year for a few years, a rate not seen since the early 1980s. And he compared the Fed's caution to not swinging hard enough at a golf ball in a sand trap. ""You need to hit it more firmly to get it up onto the grass,"" he said. ""As long as you're in the sand trap, tapping it around is not enough."" What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. All this talk has prompted dismay among economists who see little benefit in inflation, and who warn that the Fed could lose control of prices as the economy recovers. As inflation accelerates, economists agree that any benefits can be quickly outstripped by the disruptive consequences of people rushing to spend money as soon as possible. Rising inflation also punishes people living on fixed incomes, and it discourages lending and long-term investments, imposing an enduring restraint on economic growth even if the inflation subsides. ""The spectacle of American central bankers trying to press the inflation rate higher in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis is virtually without precedent,"" Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, wrote in a new book, ""The Map and the Territory."" He said the effort could end in double-digit inflation.

The current generation of policy makers came of age in the 1970s, when a higher tolerance for inflation did not deliver the promised benefits. Instead, Western economies fell into ""stagflation"" -- rising prices, little growth. Lately, however, the 1970s have seemed a less relevant cautionary tale than the fate of Japan, where prices have been in general decline since the late 1990s. Kariya, a popular instant dinner of curry in a pouch that cost 120 yen in 2000, can now be found for 68 yen, according to the blog Yen for Living. This enduring deflation, which policy makers are now trying to end, kept the economy in retreat as people hesitated to make purchases, because prices were falling, or to borrow money, because the cost of repayment was rising. ""Low inflation is not good for the economy because very low inflation increases the risks of deflation, which can cause an economy to stagnate,"" the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, a student of Japan's deflation, said in July. ""The evidence is that falling and low inflation can be very bad for an economy."" There is evidence that low inflation is hurting the American economy. ""I've always said that a little inflation is good,"" Richard A. Galanti, Costco's chief financial officer, said in December 2008. He explained that the retailer is generally able to expand its profit margins and its sales when prices are rising. This month, Mr. Galanti told analysts that sluggish inflation was one reason the company had reported its slowest revenue growth since the recession. Executives at Walmart, Rent-A-Center and Spartan Stores, a Michigan grocery chain, have similarly bemoaned the lack of inflation in recent months. Many households also have reason to miss higher inflation. Historically, higher prices have led to higher wages, allowing borrowers to repay fixed debts like mortgage loans more easily. Over the five years before 2008, inflation raised prices 10 percent. Over the last five years, prices rose 8 percent. At the current pace, prices would rise 6 percent over the next five years.

""Let me just remind everyone that inflation falling below our target of 2 percent is costly,"" Charles L. Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a speech in Madison, Wis., this month. ""If inflation is lower than expected, then debt financing is more burdensome than borrowers expected. Problems of debt overhang become that much worse for the economy.""

Now, it's going to affect the size of your paycheck next year Inflation also helps workers find jobs, according. to an influential 1996 paper by the economist George Akerlof and two co-authors. Rising prices allows companies to increase profit margins quietly, by not raising wages, which in turn makes it profitable for companies to hire additional workers. Lower rates of inflation have the opposite effect, making it harder to find work. Companies could cut wages, of course. But there is ample evidence that even during economic downturns, companies are reluctant to do so. Federal data show a large spike since the recession in the share of workers reporting no change in wages, but a much smaller increase in workers reporting wage cuts, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. There is, in practice, an invisible wall preventing pay cuts. The standard explanation is that employers fear that workers will be angry and therefore less productive. ""I want to be really careful about advocating for lower wages because I typically advocate for the other side of that equation,"" said Jared Bernstein, a fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""But I think higher inflation would help."" The Anchorage school board, facing pressure to cut costs because of a budget shortfall, began contract negotiations with its 3,500 teachers this year by proposing to freeze rather than cut wages. The final deal, completed last month, gives the teachers raises of 1 percent in each of the next three years. Teachers, while not thrilled, described the deal as better than a pay cut. But it is likely, in effect, to cut the teachers' pay. Economists expect prices to rise about 2 percent a year over the next three years, so even as the teachers take home more dollars, those dollars would have less value. Instead of a 1 percent annual increase, the teachers would fall behind by 1 percent a year. ""We feel like this contract still allows us to attract and retain quality educators,"" said Ed Graff, the Anchorage school district superintendent."

The powerful National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Alabama is meant to perturb, not console -- and to encourage truth-telling far and wide.



MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Arthur St. Clair, a minister, was lynched in Hernando County, Florida, in 1877 for performing the wedding of a black man and white woman. Fred Rochelle, 16, was burned alive in a public spectacle lynching before thousands in Polk County, Florida, in 1901. David Walker, his wife, and their four children were lynched in Hickman, Kentucky, in 1908 after Mr. Walker was accused of using inappropriate language with a white woman. Lacy Mitchell was lynched in Thomasville, Georgia, in 1930 for testifying against a white man accused of raping a black woman.

Jesse Thornton was lynched in Luverne, Alabama, in 1940 for addressing a white police officer without the title ""mister."" These appalling death notices -- there are 90 in all, based on archival accounts dating from between 1877 and 1950 -- fall like blows as you read them, one after another, lined up like epitaphs on a long wall at the new National Memorial for Peace and Justice in this city. And the shock spreads and deepens when you delve into the larger, and continuing, story of American racial violence as told in another newly opened cultural site here, the Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration. Historically, accounts of the lynching of African-Americans appeared in regional newspapers but seldom made their way into the North-based mainstream press. Photographs were rarely published anywhere. (These existed, but usually circulated privately, sometimes as postcards.) The most visible alert New York City had of such killings came from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which periodically flew a flag from its Fifth Avenue office window reading ""A Man Was Lynched Yesterday."" Mostly, though, lynching met with public silence, which lasted a long time. That silence has been decisively broken with the opening of the memorial and the museum. Both were created by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit legal advocacy group directed by Bryan Stevenson and based in Montgomery. Both address the subject of history in a way unusual until recently for American institutions: with a truth-telling, uplift-free prosecutorial directness. And both approach it by different means.



Located on the site of a building that functioned as a holding pen for enslaved men and women, the museum stands halfway between the Alabama River port where new arrivals landed and the auction market at Court Square a few blocks uptown. The space isn't large but it's jam-packed with information -- texts, photographs, videos and touch-screen animations -- layered in a way that keeps your attention constantly on the move.

The Jackson museum includes a mention of the nation's slave past, but just that. It keeps its primary focus on detailing the valiant -- and in this telling, triumphant -- movement of resistance to racism of the 1950s and '60s. The Montgomery museum downplays this movement. The purpose here is not to tell a tale of progress, but to document and dramatize a continuing condition of race-based oppression, one that has changed form over time, but not substance. It's both the back story and the front story; the constant one. At the beginning of the display, we see filmed recitations of slave narratives; later, recent video interviews with black death-row prisoners; and in between, early 20th century photos of bodies hanged, mutilated, burned.

The first thing you encounter on the path to the pavilion is a bronze tableau by the Ghanaian artist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo of enslaved African men and women straining against their shackles in panicked alarm. On the far side of the pavilion is another sculpture, this one by the American artist Hank Willis Thomas, with several black men standing side by side, arms raised. In a victory salute? No. The image derives from a 1960s picture by the South African photographer Ernest Cole of miners being subjected to a humiliating group medical examination. In an American context the same figures suggest police suspects lined up at gunpoint. The pavilion itself is a giant sculpture filled with smaller ones: more than 800 stele-like, 6-foot-tall rusted steel mini-monuments, some standing upright, others suspended. Each is inscribed with the name of a state and a county within that state (most are in the South), along with names (sometimes ""Unknown"") of African-Americans lynched in that county.

The introductory grouping is so tight as to feel imprisoning. The standing monuments look like ranks of closed steel doors or staggered headstones, blocking movement. Then the pavilion floor begins to incline downward; and the monuments are suddenly presented in suspension, as if they were gradually lifting off from the ground, higher and higher the further you descend. Imagined as the bars of a rising portcullis, they imply release. But in a memorial about lynching they read another way, as a forest of hanging bodies. Eventually they're so high that the inscribed names are unreadable, but reappear on the wall below in the jolting epitaphs: Jack Turner was lynched in Butler, Alabama, in 1882 for organizing black voters in Choctaw County. Jim Eastman was lynched in Brunswick, Tennessee, in 1887 for not allowing a white man to beat him in a fight. Elizabeth Lawrence was lynched in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1933 for reprimanding white children who threw rocks at her.

The Equal Justice Initiative has invited each county named on a monument in the pavilion to claim its duplicate and set it up in a public site on home turf, preferably at a spot where a lynching took place. The idea is both to spread the word about a suppressed history of racial terrorism, and to honor the victims of it. Whether the monuments will be adopted, and when, and by whom, remains to be seen. (So far, there have been inquiries, but no commitments.) Together the individual and collective destinies of these markers -- which ones stay unclaimed and which ones move on -- will constitute an ethical narrative of its own. It's one about the irresolvable tension between truth and reconciliation. And it's about the human capacity to acknowledge evil -- undeniable, preventable and present -- or ignore it. Which means condone it."

On Wednesday, the producers of this big-budget, big-ape spectacle -- they're no longer describing it as a traditional musical, although it's a stage show with a score and songs -- said ""King Kong"" would arrive at the Broadway Theater in the fall of 2018.

The show is the brainchild of an Australian animatronics company, and its only previous production was in Melbourne. Its arrival on Broadway has been long delayed: In 2010, the producers said they were aiming for a 2013 Broadway bow; in 2013, they talked of a possible 2014 Broadway opening, as well as international productions of the show; and by 2014, they had stopped attaching a timeline to their project. But now, for the first time, they are announcing a theater as well as a time frame.

Carmen Pavlovic, the lead producer, said ""King Kong"" had been offered a Broadway theater in 2014, but chose to delay as the show was reconceived after its only previous production, in 2013 in Melbourne. That staging drew high marks for spectacle -- there seems to be a consensus that the 20-foot-high title character, a combination puppet-robot, is a compelling marvel -- but mixed reviews for storytelling."

Once tortured by dogs in a blood sport called badger baiting, it is now a protected species in Britain.

But the beloved creatures also carry bovine tuberculosis, a disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of cows across Britain since at least the 1970s. For that reason, the omnivorous mustelids have been targeted in bloody culls to control the disease's spread.

In some instances the effort worked; in others, it didn't. All along, Britons who love badgers have questioned the effectiveness and necessity of the culls.

In a new study, researchers simulated different badger-culling scenarios, and discovered that culling can help reduce the spread of wildlife disease. But to work, the efforts must fall within a ""Goldilocks zone,"" wherein the number of animals killed, the ground covered and the duration of the cull all must be just right. The study's results, published in Journal of the Royal Society Interface on Tuesday, help explain some of the mystery over the varied effectiveness of the culls, which has driven decades of dispute in Britain. The results also provide a framework for understanding culling efforts to stop the spread of wildlife diseases in other animals, and suggest that on-the-ground realities often make a successful cull unattainable."

The decision continues a roller-coaster stretch for the studio, which recently lost its president, Roy Price, following sexual harassment allegations; scored a ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptation; and picked up wins at the Golden Globes.

The cancellations signal a recalibration for Amazon, which has taken a middle path in output compared to Netflix -- which plans to flood the market with new shows and movies, estimating to spend between $7 billion and $8 billion on original content in 2018 -- and HBO, which has devoted its resources to a few cultural juggernauts like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Westworld.""

Amazon spent an estimated $4.5 billion in 2017 and tried to reach an array of audiences. ""Jean-Claude Van Johnson"" was an action comedy starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a washed-up version of himself, while ""One Mississippi,"" created by Tig Notaro, and ""I Love Dick,"" by Jill Soloway and Sarah Gubbins, explored sickness, sexuality and gender roles with a frank honesty. All three received strong reviews, but they mostly failed to break into award races or generate mainstream attention.

The studio is not abandoning female-led comedies altogether: ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" will move forward after winning best television comedy series at the Golden Globes this month; and the studio just inked a two-year deal with Sharon Horgan, the creator of ""Catastrophe."" But the move does indicate a scaling back of smaller projects in favor of landing a mainstream hit. The studio passed on three comedy pilots in December -- including the Bridget Everett vehicle ""Love You More"" -- and canceled the feminist show ""Good Girls Revolt,"" set in 1969 and '70."

Among those seeking medical care for Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, black patients were hospitalized at nearly three times the rate of white and Hispanic patients, according to an analysis of patient records from a large health care system in Northern California. The disparity remained even after researchers took into account differences in age, sex, income and the prevalence of chronic health problems that exacerbate Covid-19, like hypertension and Type 2 diabetes.

The finding suggests that black patients may have had limited access to medical care or that they postponed seeking help until later in the course of their illness, when the disease was more advanced. Black patients were also far less likely than white, Hispanic or Asian patients to have been tested for the virus before going to the emergency room for care. Black patients ""are coming to us later and sicker, and they're accessing our care through the emergency department and acute care environment,"" said Dr. Stephen H. Lockhart, the chief medical officer at Sutter Health in Sacramento and one of the authors of the new study. The study, which was peer reviewed, was published in Health Affairs. Delayed care may give the virus more time to spread through households and neighborhoods, Dr. Lockhart and his colleagues concluded. The delays also suggest that minority patients continue to face barriers despite California's broad expansion of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. ""How soon you access care, even supportive care, affects how you experience illness and how much pain and suffering you have,"" said Kristen M.J. Azar, a research scientist at Sutter Health who was the study's lead author.

She added, ""While we don't necessarily have treatments at this point, there are therapies being developed, and identifying people early on as these treatments become available will be important in order to prevent poor outcomes, like death and being put on ventilators."" Dr. Clyde W. Yancy, chief of cardiology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, said the granular study of patient records bolstered cruder public health reports of higher Covid-19 death rates among black Americans. The data confirm that socioeconomic factors play an outsize role in influencing health status and vulnerability to infection, he added. ""Where and how we live contributes greatly to our health,"" said Dr. Yancy, who has written about health disparities and the pandemic. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The new study analyzed the electronic health records of 1,052 confirmed Covid-19 patients who sought care between Jan. 1 and April 8 at Sutter Health, a health system serving 3.5 million patients in Northern California. More than half of the 61 black patients who tested positive for the coronavirus were admitted to hospitals, compared with about one-quarter or fewer of the Hispanic, white and Asian patients who tested positive. Black patients were also more likely than the others to be so sick that they required treatment in an intensive care unit."

Throughout his career, the veteran choreographer Tere O'Connor has been waging a vehement battle against assigning meaning to dance. But in ""The Goodbye Studies,"" he veers toward it -- on his own terms.

In this new work, being performed by 12 stellar dancers at the Kitchen, Mr. O'Connor makes the idea of the crowd his subject. Even so, individuals are discernible throughout, and meaning, formulated by Mr. O'Connor's uncanny sense of structure, is attained not from story but from sensation. You watch, you listen to the steps, you wait: Inevitably, among the fragments -- some soft and fuzzy, others jagged -- a picture emerges.

Mr. O'Connor's crowd builds slowly. Lauren Vermilion, looking angelic in a printed romper, is the first to appear. She pads onto the stage, stands and shifts slightly before exiting and returning. Others follow her pattern until the stage is full of performers, looking out with expressions that signal gradations of empathy, dread and hope.

Without mirroring each other, Eleanor Hullihan and Tess Dworman are a support system as they drift side by side, with brushing feet and drifting arms; later, Lily Gold and Oisin Monaghan, caught in an embrace, roll on the floor as the others watch -- fondly, casually -- from the side. In other moments, dancers cross the stage in steely demi-point walks, as if wearing invisible high heels, or prance in profile. Mr. O'Connor's constantly unfolding scenes have the feel of a needle dropping randomly on a record; it's the same band but different songs."

Not only were many money managers and experts dead wrong about his chances, but they were doubly wrong in betting on a big market sell-off in the event he won. Mr. Trump's victory kicked off a continuing stock rally that left the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up nearly 10 percent by the end of the year, a gain few anticipated a year ago. But there were other major moves in markets last year. After interest rates hit what some have called a 5,000-year low (but who's counting?) -- and moved into the through-the-looking-glass realm of negative returns in some parts of Europe -- they suddenly reversed course in the United States, rising abruptly toward the end of the year as expectations for growth and inflation soared. Even more striking was the abrupt turn in oil and commodity prices, which rippled through the economy and markets. A year ago they were in free fall, with no end in sight. But after hitting a 13-year low of less than $27 a barrel on Feb. 11, they ended the year above $53.

A year ago, investors were treating oil and commodity companies like Freeport McMoRan (a stock I highlighted last year) as all but dead. By the end of the year, its stock had more than doubled -- a reminder that contrarian bets, when they prove right, can deliver huge returns. Again this year, I turned to some prominent investors and market experts who successfully maneuvered through what turned into a treacherous year, asking them for insights into how they did it and what they expect in 2017. ""I was ridiculed,"" Anthony Scaramucci told me this week, referring to his early and vocal support for Donald Trump. Unlike many on Wall Street, the outspoken Mr. Scaramucci -- the founder of SkyBridge Capital, host of a revived ""Wall Street Week"" television show on the Fox Business Channel and author of several books on business and investing -- went all in for Mr. Trump after initially backing Jeb Bush. Nor did the so-called Trump rally come as a surprise to him. ""To put it simply, if you get a 35 percent corporate rate reduced to 15 percent or even 20 percent, you're looking at a 30 percent earnings increase for most companies,"" he told me as he took a short break from the Trump transition team. SkyBridge focuses mostly on hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments, but also offers a high-yielding stock mutual fund, the SkyBridge Dividend Value Fund. The fund gained over 15 percent last year, handily outpacing the S.&P. 500.

As a long-only fund -- one that invests in securities for their potential gains and doesn't short stocks, or bet on potential declines -- ""we benefited enormously from the Trump win,"" Mr. Scaramucci said. ""It's true that contrarians often get things wrong. But when they get it right, there's a tidal wave. Trump is an example. The conventional wisdom was that he couldn't win. Assets were priced relative to the conventional wisdom. So when he did win, there was huge upside."" What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. Mr. Scaramucci attributes his contrarian view of Mr. Trump in part to the fact he lives on Long Island, a stone's throw from his working-class parents, and not among the Manhattan elite, even though he's an alumnus of Harvard Law School and Goldman Sachs. ""Everyone in the local bar, from the bluest- to the whitest-collar workers, was voting for Trump,"" he said. But Mr. Scaramucci isn't blindly contrarian. He did initially bet wrong on Mr. Bush. ""I pivoted,"" he said. ""Everyone makes mistakes. The question is, How do you adapt? All entrepreneurs have to do that."" Now Mr. Scaramucci is in the Trump inner sanctum as a member of the transition team, in a position not only to predict the future, but also to help shape it. Not surprisingly, he's bullish on the economy and stock market for 2017. He expects the kind of high-dividend, value-oriented stocks his fund invests in (some of its biggest holdings last year were Best Buy, Caterpillar and Boeing) to do well unless ""we get to hyper-growth, in which case there will be a rotation to growth stocks."" He said fears of a Trump-induced trade war were overblown. ""No one wants a trade war,"" he said. ""All we're calling for are fairer free-trade arrangements around the world."" He added: ""We're not coming at this from a position of ideological purity. There are a lot of practical business people in the room. We're not asking if something is right or left, but whether it's right or wrong.""

Jerome L. Dodson is the founder and president of Parnassus Investments, and lead portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor Fund. He champions the notion of doing well by doing good. ""Certain social and environmental values are really important to us,"" he told me this week. His fund doesn't invest in fossil fuels. He seeks out companies that treat their employees well and where turnover is low. In a highly competitive world where cutthroat capitalists scoff at such values, he's also emerged on top: His Parnassus Endeavor Fund is ranked by Morningstar as the No. 1 fund in its category (large-cap growth) over one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods -- a remarkable feat. Mr. Dodson follows a highly disciplined approach that considers only companies trading at less than two-thirds of their intrinsic value -- a subjective assessment of the actual value of a company, without regard to its market price -- which makes him as much a value investor as a growth investor. He doesn't worry much about typical macro events or predictions, like the outcomes of presidential elections, the direction of interest rates, or oil prices. He doesn't claim to be much of a forecaster, and said he was surprised that two of his fund's positions -- John Deere, the farm equipment icon, and Cummins, the engine maker -- ended up doing so well last year. ""All you can do is look for good companies that are undervalued,"" he said. ""There is no way to know when they're going to go up."" Understand Inflation and How It Affects You

Now, it's going to affect the size of your paycheck next year A typical investment for his fund was the chip maker Micron Technology, whose shares had been battered by declining revenue and a global chip glut. Mr. Dodson calculated that Micron shares were trading at just one-third of their intrinsic value when he bought them for an average of $10.80 a share. Equally important, Micron ""is a great place to work, with good employee benefits and relatively low turnover,"" he said. Last year it was the Endeavor Fund's largest holding. This week it was trading above $22, more than double the fund's average cost. ""We are holding onto the stock but wouldn't buy a lot more today,"" Mr. Dodson said.

Indeed, with the market so high, it's getting hard for Mr. Dodson to find stocks that meet his intrinsic value criteria. Ideally, he'd like to have about 40 stocks in the fund. Currently he has just 25. ""It's fair to say I'm cautious about the coming year,"" he said. ""That's because valuations are so high."" Still, ""if Trump can deliver some of what he's talking about, which is tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and the economy starts growing at 3 percent, then earnings will increase, causing the price-to-earnings ratio to come down,"" he said. ""That would make me more positive about 2017."" In all likelihood, yes, said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research for the Goldman Sachs's global investment research commodities team. Mr. Courvalin makes a rare return appearance this year, after pretty much nailing it in his forecast for 2016. Last year he predicted further weakness in oil prices, followed by a recovery by the year's end -- which is just what happened. This year Mr. Courvalin and his team are predicting $59 a barrel for Brent crude over the next three to six months, with prices stabilizing in the longer term at $55 to $60. That's because a price much above $60 is likely to cause a supply surge, especially from United States shale producers. But Mr. Courvalin said investors should focus less on price than on inventory. When high current inventories drive down spot prices, high-cost producers are at a disadvantage, but can still sell forward futures contracts at a premium. More normalized inventories lower or eliminate that incentive and reduce price volatility, which is a benefit to low-cost producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Because of that shift in the forward futures curve, there is upside potential for oil and commodities investors even if price gains in the spot market are modest. ""You want to see demand levels that are strong, and we're getting there,"" he said. This has little to do with Mr. Trump or his policies. While the president-elect is seen as likely to encourage higher United States energy production, a higher supply will be offset by stronger demand and a stronger dollar. In any event, it's likely to take years for any Trump policies to affect market supply and demand. ""We expect oil demand to be good next year,"" Mr. Courvalin said. ""We're at a point in the business cycle where you can expect to see much better returns from commodities than from equities, based on historical patterns."""

The criticisms came at three hearings on Capitol Hill that showcased Washington's widening range of concerns with Silicon Valley. Lawmakers from both parties, including Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas who oversees a subcommittee on the Constitution, and Representative David N. Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island who leads a subcommittee on antitrust law, took aim at the businesses. The executives acknowledged that technology had changed, and sometimes hurt, companies in industries like retailing, advertising, music and movies. But their companies, they said, have opened new opportunities to millions of entrepreneurs and small businesses. They insisted they faced competitors at every turn -- entrenched big companies, ascendant start-ups and each other. And consumers, they said, are big winners, benefiting from convenience, lower prices and new products and services.

But their celebration of the virtues of Big Tech did not carry the day. Some lawmakers were sympathetic, but this was not their stage. Most were decidedly unconvinced, even disdainful. ""Facebook has said, 'Just trust us,'"" Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said at a hearing focused on the social media company's cryptocurrency efforts. ""And every time Americans trust you, they seem to get burned."" The hearing performances were a telling moment, showing the rising force of the backlash against the tech giants. Not long ago revered as treasures of American capitalism, they are now targets of political attacks from both parties, growing public criticism and regulatory scrutiny. President Trump has also turned up the volume of his critique of tech companies in recent weeks. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission recently decided to divide responsibility for potential antitrust investigations. The Justice Department is taking Google and Apple, while the F.T.C. has Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the F.T.C. voted to fine Facebook about $5 billion for mishandling users' personal information, by far the agency's largest fine against a tech company. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan inquiry into the power and practices of major technology companies. The subcommittee announced the investigation last month and planned to request documents from the companies and hear testimony from confidential witnesses, who may fear retribution from the tech giants.

It has also started holding hearings, including one on Tuesday afternoon that was focused on how Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google altered innovation and entrepreneurial activity. The practices under scrutiny included acquiring upstart competitors and favoring their own offerings on the digital marketplaces they operate. Lawmakers appeared to be zeroing in on the areas that concern them the most. In one exchange, Mr. Cicilline addressed whether the tech companies' marketplaces -- for goods, software apps and online ads -- gave them an unfair advantage over rivals who rely on those marketplaces to distribute their own products or services. He pointed to Amazon's many lines of private label products, which compete for sales on the company's site with similar products from other brands.

""I respectfully disagree,"" replied Mr. Sutton, who said that many big brick-and-mortar retailers offer private label brands. Amazon's control of products on its site, Mr. Cicilline said, is different and stronger than that of a traditional retailer that offers some private-label merchandise. At one point, Mr. Cicilline pointedly told Mr. Sutton, ""I may remind you, sir. You are under oath."" Isn't it the case, Mr. Cicilline pressed, that the best sale for Amazon is the sale of an Amazon-branded product, and that Amazon uses the vast amount of data it collects to favor its own offerings?

""No, that is not true,"" Mr. Sutton replied. He pointed out that not only is Facebook the world's largest social network, but that those ranked third, fourth and sixth -- WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram -- are Facebook properties. Owning the four of the top six players in a market, Mr. Neguse said, spoke for itself. ""We have a word for that,"" he said. ""It is called monopoly."" Earlier in the day, in the hearing about Facebook's cryptocurrency project, Libra, lawmakers grilled David Marcus, a top executive. The company has a bold goal with the project: to offer an alternative financial system that makes it possible to send money around the world with few fees. But the company has run into bipartisan resistance from Washington, including the White House. The initiative is far from the first effort of its kind. The best-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is in wide circulation, and it introduced the idea of digital currencies that are free from government control. But the Libra effort has put a spotlight on cryptocurrencies and amplified the voices of critics who say the technology has little value beyond speculative investing and illegal transactions, like online drug sales. Last week, the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said Libra raised ""serious concerns"" around ""money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability."" Mr. Trump and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have also criticized Libra and other cryptocurrencies in the past week.

The Republicans took turns battering Karan Bhatia, Google's vice president for government affairs and public policy. Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, delivered the most pointed attacks. He said it was hard to believe Google's executives when they say that censoring search results would go against the company's mission and ideology, considering that the search giant had been working on plans to re-enter China with a censored search engine. ""Clearly, our trust and patience in your company and your monopoly has run out,"" said Mr. Hawley, who has been a vocal critic of Google. Mr. Bhatia responded by saying that Google had abandoned plans to restart its search engine in China. Mr. Cruz, the chairman of the subcommittee, said Congress needed to rethink the legal immunity for internet companies, established in 1996, that protects them from liability for content posted by users. The law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has allowed platforms like Google's YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to grow rapidly without concern of being held liable for content on those services. Even before the hearing that focused on Google, the president applied his own brand of pressure with an early morning tweet. He said that his administration ""will investigate"" remarks from the billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who said that Google had been infiltrated by the Chinese intelligence. Mr. Thiel also accused the technology giant of treason for refusing to work with the Pentagon on a future artificial intelligence project while agreeing to work with the Chinese military. He provided no evidence for his allegations. A Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company had not worked with the Chinese military and that it had cooperated with the American government in many areas such as cybersecurity, recruiting and health care.

As president of Andrews McMeel Syndication, Mr. Salem oversaw that strip and numerous others.





The package of rough scribbles that Cathy Guisewite sent to the Universal Press Syndicate in 1976 did not look at all like the accomplished comic strips that Lee Salem usually edited. ""I could not draw at all,"" Ms. Guisewite recalled. ""What I sent Lee wasn't organized into a strip; it was just raw emotion on the page. These were drawings meant for my mother's eyes only: the humiliating, worst moments of one young career woman's life."" But Mr. Salem recognized a strong new voice in Ms. Guisewite's embryonic work. Rather than tell her to spend more time developing her idea s, he quickly sent her a contract to create ""Cathy"" -- an anxiety-ridden (""Ack! ""), body-conscious woman whose vulnerability would strike a nerve with readers pleased to follow her, frame by frame. ""He sent me a note with the contract saying he was confident I could draw,"" Ms. Guisewite said in a phone interview.

Mr. Salem died on Sept. 2 at his home in Leawood , Kan. He was 73. His wife, Anita (Parker) Salem, said the cause was a stroke. Mr. Salem understood what made comic strips tick, prized lively writing and gave his cartoonists substantial leeway. ""We believe in the creative process, and we believe that the cartoonists, once they have developed a relationship with their readers, have a right to try certain things,"" he said in an interview for the website Mr. Media in 2007.

Mr. Salem also positioned himself as what Mr. Trudeau called a ""human firewall"" when readers or newspaper executives were angered by episodes of ""Doonesbury."" In 1985, Mr. Salem chose not to distribute six installments of ""Doonesbury"" that satirized the anti-abortion film ""The Silent Scream."" That story arc was ""so controversial that it might kill the strip altogether,"" Mr. Salem told The New York Times. A month later, Mr. Trudeau mocked Frank Sinatra's alleged ties to organized crime and had him, in one strip, threatening a casino blackjack dealer if she shuffled the cards before dealing. Through his lawyer, Mickey Rudin, Sinatra demanded a retraction.

""Lee called me up and said in that calm, steady voice of his, 'Rudin says you got a lot of the facts wrong,'"" Mr. Trudeau said in a eulogy delivered at Mr. Salem 's memorial service. ""And I replied: 'Of course I got a lot of the facts wrong. I made them up.'"" So, Mr. Trudeau added, ""Lee directed the syndicate's counsel to send a one-sentence reply stating the obvious: that the strip was covered by the First Amendment. Rudin stood down."" Lee Salem was born on July 21, 1946, in Orlando, Fla., and grew up in Boston and Portsmouth, N.H. His parents were Rosemary ( Segars ) Salem, a waitress, bartender and factory worker, and Louis Salem .

Mr. Salem received a bachelor's degree in English from Park College in Parkville, Mo., and taught high school English for a year. He then earned his master's in English at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. While attending graduate school, he worked in the claims department of a health insurance company. One of his college teachers, who was freelancing at the Universal Press Syndicate (now called Andrews McMeel Syndication), recommended him for a job at the syndicate as an assistant editor in 1974. In 1981, he was promoted to vice president and editorial director. ""He took over for my father, and the editorial side never missed a beat,"" Hugh Andrews, the chairman of Andrews McMeel Universal , said by phone. (Mr. Andrews's father, Jim, founded the syndicate with John McMeel in 1970.) ""Lee was at his core very smart, caring and compassionate, and as loyal to his creators as he could be.""

One of those creators was Mr. Watterson, who in 1985 brought Universal a comic strip about a little boy named Calvin whose stuffed toy tiger, Hobbes, comes to life, but only in Calvin' s mind. ""It was so breathtakingly simple, fresh and professional that I had to set it aside with the thought, 'This can't be as good as I think it is,'"" Mr. Salem recalled in an interview for the website GoComics in 2015. He circulated samples of ""Calvin and Hobbes"" around the office and at home, where his son, Matt, told him, ""This is the 'Doonesbury' for kids."" Mr. Watterson said that Mr. Salem could read through a month's worth of ""Calvin and Hobbes"" strips and not even giggle. ""He could have been reading obituaries for all the delight he radiated,"" Mr. Watterson told The Washington Post in 2012. Mr. Salem said he had been taught by Jim Andrews that it was a sign of weakness to laugh at a cartoonist's work in front of the cartoonist.

""He would talk to me about what worked and didn't work, but once it started, he was this solid rock wall behind me, and he was that for all of us,"" she said. And he never tossed out the original package she sent him."
57056,Japan's Bond-Buying Plan Quickly Meets Criticism,The Bank of Japan set an ambitious 2 percent inflation target and pledged to ease monetary policy but there are doubts about just how much of an effect the moves will have.,"A port in Tokyo. Japan's economy, the third largest in the world, has been plagued by deflation since the 1990s.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/23/business/BANK/BANK-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=370&w=600&s=69de97896f9bf786af1cae06226239c5968b1e4e3da5b1ba6c966d1f5bc0508d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/global/japanese-central-bank-in-forceful-move-to-fight-deflation.html,90acd5b3-3c3a-50fd-91bf-f07b84c06923.jpg,"Another central bank, another round of unconventional monetary policy. Following the lead of their counterparts in the United States, Japan's central bankers announced Tuesday what they called a groundbreaking effort to reinvigorate the country's long-moribund economy and defeat deflation. With no more room left to cut interest rates and previous steps unsuccessful, the Bank of Japan is taking a page from the Federal Reserve's playbook and will pump trillions more yen into the economy by directly buying government bonds and other assets. It also doubled the country's official inflation target to 2 percent. The action came after months of intense pressure on the Bank of Japan from the country's audacious new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to take more aggressive action to bolster the economy. But as in the United States, there are doubts about just how much of an effect the move will have in Japan. Three rounds of asset purchases since the onset of the financial crisis have successfully headed off deflation in the American economy but failed to generate the kind of growth necessary to return employment to prerecession levels. Japan's move is also likely to further devalue the yen in the long term -- causing some to worry about a possible round of competitive devaluations as countries weaken their currencies to bolster growth in exports. On Tuesday, however, the yen actually rose against the dollar and the euro amid disappointment that the Bank of Japan's efforts had not gone far enough.

Traditionally, curbing inflation, not worrying about deflation, has been the principal task of central bankers. But when economies enter prolonged periods of slow growth, or even contraction, other concerns come to the fore. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was keenly aware of Japan's long-running struggle with deflation as well as the American experience in the Great Depression when he began the first round of United States asset purchases, or quantitative easing, in November 2008. After a second round of quantitative easing beginning in November 2010, the Fed started a third round in September. It said in December that it would continue to purchase $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities each month until the job market improved. After considerable pressure, European central bankers also began moving more aggressively last year, vowing to do ""whatever it takes"" to keep the euro zone from fracturing.

Given the scale of the efforts in the United States and Europe, many experts were disappointed by the Bank of Japan's action because the expanded asset purchases will not begin until 2014. They complained that was a waste of valuable time in turning around an economy whose descent into deflation has become a test case of the effects of doing too little in the face of an economic slowdown. To make matters worse, the Bank of Japan's new plan to purchase 10 trillion yen, or $112 billion, in assets each month sounds more aggressive than it actually will be, said Gustavo Reis, senior international economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That is because many of the securities the Bank of Japan will be purchasing are in the form of short-term debt that will quickly mature, so the additional purchases will equal about $112 billion a year -- not a month -- beginning in 2014.

By contrast, he said, the Fed's balance sheet is expected to expand by a trillion dollars in 2013. ""The Bank of Japan should be more aggressive,"" Mr. Reis said. ""It's a step forward, but given where their economy is, they need to do more."" In fact, with such a small annual increase in asset purchases, it is unlikely Japan will achieve 2 percent inflation, analysts said. The Consumer Price Index for 2012 fell 0.5 percent, according to government statistics. The Bank of Japan's announcement ""will likely disappoint those who expected the policy board to answer Abe's call for a 'different kind of B.O.J. policy,' or significantly ramp up its pace of easing,"" Izumi Devalier, an economist with HSBC, said in a note to clients. While certainly better than inaction, there is evidence that unconventional monetary policy can only do so much to lift overall economic growth. The Fed's monetary policy seems to be having a much more significant effect on asset prices than it has on the underlying economy, said Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays. He noted that nearly four years after markets hit bottom in March 2009, stocks in the United States had more than doubled in value. By contrast, ""most people would characterize the economic recovery as weak."" For all the challenges in the United States and Europe, Japan's economy, the world's third largest, has been depressed for much longer; the 1990s are regarded as a ""lost decade,"" and the last 10 years are proving to be not much better. Deflation, an all-around fall in prices, profit and incomes, has plagued the country since the late 1990s.

Mr. Abe's call for the Bank of Japan to increase the monetary supply has weakened the yen, a boon for exporters, which are responsible for much of Japan's growth. Earlier this month, Mr. Abe also announced an emergency stimulus of 12 trillion yen, providing even more tail wind for the Japanese economy. Those steps have pushed the Nikkei stock index 20 percent higher since mid-November, when Mr. Abe first campaigned on his expansionary platform. In a joint statement with the government, the Bank of Japan said it was doubling its inflation target to 2 percent and said it would ""pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time."" The bank's board voted to keep its benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent. The bank also updated its estimates for economic growth in fiscal 2012 and 2013. The bank now forecasts growth of 1 percent for 2012 and 2.3 percent for 2013, with the increase taking into account the new measures. Mr. Abe immediately hailed the bank's moves, telling the Bank of Japan governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, that the measures were ""groundbreaking,"" according to Kyodo News. Mr. Abe's critics, however, warn that the central bank will become a printing press for profligate government spending -- expenditures that carry great risks for a country whose public debt is already twice the size of its economy. Critics also say that before flooding a broken system with money, Japan must first tackle structural problems that hurt economic efficiency. Mr. Abe maintains that deflation will undermine any efforts to grow, and that the government and central bank must act together to get prices rising again. But in a nod to critics, the joint statement said the government would also promote ""all possible decisive policy actions for reforming the economic structure"" and establish ""a sustainable fiscal structure."" ""I believe we are firmly on the path toward bold monetary easing,"" Mr. Abe told reporters."

Sir Jack Brabham was the last to claim that honor. Nico Rosberg, the pole position winner, came in a frustrated second, and Valttieri Bottas, of Williams, was third.

Rosberg, whose Mercedes suffered front wing damage on the second lap in a collision with his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, was unable to recoup the time he lost making a pit stop for a new nose section. Hamilton was leading at the time, but one of his tires was punctured in the mishap, and he eventually had to retire from the race. Hamilton collected no points, and Rosberg picked up 18 -- as well as the criticism of his team's bosses -- pushing his lead over Hamilton in the championship standings to 220-191.

The Mercedes team had qualified much faster than the rest of the field, and victory seemed assured. But Ricciardo, who qualified his Renault-powered Red Bull car a seemingly uncompetitive fifth, put together a smooth, error-free drive that propelled him to the front and kept him there for most of the race. It was the third victory of his rookie season, and it moved him into third in the points battle with 156 counters.

# Joey Logano capped a big weekend for Penske Racing with a victory Saturday night in the Nascar Sprint Cup event at Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee. It was Logano's third victory of the Sprint Cup season, and it completed a sweep for the Penske squad that included Brad Keselowski's victory the Nascar truck series, and Ryan Blaney's triumph in the Nationwide series race."

The accuser, Andrea Constand, said she had called him as she drove up to his home on the night in January 2004 when she says he sexually assaulted her. ""Can you find one single call for the whole month of January to his Elkins Park number?"" Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Cosby asked Ms. Constand, as she reviewed the records. ""I might have been mistaken,"" Ms. Constand replied. Ms. Constand remained outwardly calm during two hours of cross-examination in the sexual assault retrial, fending off queries on a variety of topics that the defense brought forward to indicate she had converted a consensual sexual encounter with Mr. Cosby into a criminal assault in order to score a big payday.

She later said, in redirect testimony, that there were other numbers she was able to call to reach Mr. Cosby, whom she has accused of drugging and molesting her at his home near here. The defense, though, continued to point to the phone records as evidence that Ms. Constand had kept in touch with Mr. Cosby in the following weeks at a level at odds with her account of having been assaulted. They said Ms. Constand had called Mr. Cosby more than 70 times in the weeks following the encounter, including two calls she made to Mr. Cosby on Valentine's Day that year. Ms. Constand, who was director of operations for the Temple University women's basketball team at the time, said she was only calling Mr. Cosby on matters of business at the university, where he was a powerful trustee and its best known alumnus. In many cases, she said that she was only returning his calls, perhaps to alert him to a basketball game, and that her contacts were not evidence of any romance. ""I called many people on Valentine's Day, sir,"" she said at one point. ""I called him when he called me,"" she added. ""I didn't have a reason to call Mr. Cosby."" In the afternoon, Ms. Constand's mother, Gianna Constand, testified that she did call to confront Mr. Cosby after her daughter told her about being assaulted. Even before that conversation, Ms. Constand said she had noticed her daughter's distressed state, including twitching and screaming at night, and thought she was both depressed and withdrawn.

""My daughter was not the same person when she came home from Toronto,"" Ms. Constand said. ""She was not the same person as when she left."" In their phone call in 2005, Mrs. Constand said Mr. Cosby provided a graphic, detailed account of touching her daughter sexually. ""He did say to me, 'Don't worry mum --there was no penile penetration,'"" Mrs. Constand testified.

Kathleen Bliss, a lawyer for Mr. Cosby, suggested that Ms. Constand's mother had herself benefitted from the financial settlement. Defense lawyers had similarly attacked Ms. Constand's credibility last June when the first trial on these charges against Mr. Cosby ended in a mistrial after jurors became deadlocked. Mr. Cosby's new crop of lawyers has been aggressive in portraying Ms. Constand as a desperate ""con artist"" who schemed to get one over on a rich but lonely man because she needed money. The defense, for example, has accused her of running a pyramid scheme over six months during her time at Temple, suggesting she sent emails to solicit money as part of a scam. But Ms. Constand testified she had only sent one email, soliciting $65., She said she simply cut and pasted language crafted by someone else into the email that she herself had little understanding of.

""I was just helping a friend,"" she said. Prosecutors said it could not have been a pyramid scheme because the solicitation invited people to buy products like software. Ms. Constand, 45, sued Mr. Cosby in 2005 after prosecutors initially declined to take on her case. She later received a settlement of $3.38 million. She has said that Mr. Cosby, now 80, took advantage of his position as her mentor to bring her to his home where he gave her three pills that incapacitated her. Five other women testified last week that they, too, believe Mr. Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them. To support the argument that Ms. Constand's account is a fabrication, Mr. Cosby's lawyers plan to bring forward an academic adviser at Temple who said she had roomed with her during university basketball trips. The adviser, Marguerite Jackson, has said Ms. Constand told her before the incident with Mr. Cosby that she could fabricate a claim of sexual assault about a celebrity to get money. Ms. Jackson was barred from testifying at the first trial after Ms. Constand told the court she did not know her. But the defense has brought forward two former Temple colleagues who say Ms. Constand and Ms. Jackson actually did know one another. But Ms. Constand denied that again in testimony on Monday. Ms. Jackson's name sounded familiar, she said, but she said she had never spoken to her and had never roomed with anyone on basketball trips."
48153,Finding a Job That Works for You,Experts say that those choosing a career can often be misled by their biases to follow a parent's path or to look only at a field's tangible rewards.,Sunil Yapa turned away from an academic career to become a novelist.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/27/your-money/27FIRSTJOB/27FIRSTJOB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=ae4f5fdfc1697e4838d4a7e14fbc8539050f512eb081f935ea9733f6f0e307a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/your-money/finding-a-job-that-works-for-you.html,03ce4cf9-3dd9-5305-adbb-a907a98b497d.jpg,"Sunil Yapa was bouncing from college to college, searching for a career, when he decided to return to a familiar place: his hometown, State College, Pa. There, he found himself in the building where he had often visited his father, Lakshman, a geography professor at Penn State. He took his dad's classes, helped him write a draft of a book about the social construction of poverty and earned a bachelor's degree in geography in 2003. ""I was getting ready to take over the family business,"" Mr. Yapa said. He planned to complete a doctorate after an extended trip to China. But once he landed on the other side of the world, away from his family and culture, he returned to the writing practice he had loved as a teenager but abandoned. ""I was lucky,"" Mr. Yapa said. ""In the end I didn't have to choose just one. If I had walked away from writing, I would have been a mess."" He earned a Master of Fine Arts from Hunter College in 2010 and started a novel about Seattle's 1999 World Trade Organization protests. ""Your Heart Is a Muscle the Size of a Fist,"" which includes themes about geography, came out in January.

""It seems so stupid, looking back on it,"" he said of his struggle to accept a career that should have been obvious. Being a writer has not been without a downside, though; before he sold his book, he took on side jobs, including selling posters to college students, to get by. According to behavioral economists, he is not unusual. Career choices are not obvious or simple to make. Experts have found that biases that we are not aware of skew our perception of our options and create blind spots on our choices. Understanding these biases can help young people succeed in selecting a profession that will earn them a living and also yield fulfillment, a sense of purpose and a chance to master a skill that fascinates them. In pursuing geography, Mr. Yapa nearly fell into the trap of what is called status quo bias. ""People generally don't like change,"" said Alain Samson, a behavioral science consultant and editor of the Behavioral Economics Guide. ""It's human to go down the path of least resistance and stick to what we know best."" While the narrowest definition of this bias is individual behavior that involves inertia or avoidance of change, it is also a tendency that can influence children to follow their parents into the same line of work. It is important to keep long-term happiness in mind, because another bias can lead to an overemphasis on the next few years rather than the next few decades. ""Many of us avoid actions that are costly in the short term, even if they present payoffs in the future,"" Mr. Samson said. ""In behavioral economics, this is called present bias.""

He added, ""The younger you are, the more difficult it is to think about the future."" Present bias could prevent someone from pursuing a job that requires an initial investment in education, Mr. Samson said. The bias could also encourage a person to choose a job that offers high pay initially, but has limited opportunities for advancement. To combat these biases, economists suggest speaking to professionals in various stages of a career. Experienced mentors can offer a longer-term perspective on what it will be like to work in that area for most of your life; younger workers can offer a view of what it's like to start in the field now. This kind of investigation, economists say, will help job hunters avoid another serious mistake: making choices based on the most obvious factors. ""Behavioral economics tells us that people often focus too much on the wrong things, and tend to focus on aspects of the job that are salient,"" said Alan Krueger, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. ""So, for example, the pay is salient, especially the starting pay."" When making decisions under this salient bias, people may place more importance on visible or quantifiable features, such as the Corvette a lawyer drives, without considering the less readily visible, such as how satisfied that lawyer may be with his career. ""One of the things we know from behavioral economics is that social interactions are very important,"" Mr. Krueger said. ""Do people feel like they're treated fairly? Do they get along with the people they work with? I think that's an aspect of the job people should focus on to a greater extent. Do they find the work intrinsically rewarding?"" Richard Freeman, a professor of economics at Harvard University, advises students to explore the world hands-on as much as they can through internships or a gap year. He suggests that if students do not like what they find that way, they could try a different employer or another job in the same field to see if that helps."
16896,Review: Esa-Pekka Salonen Takes a Bow in San Francisco,The field and audiences are watching for the fruits of a new relationship at the San Francisco Symphony.,"Esa-Pekka Salonen, the next music director of the San Francisco Symphony, conducting the orchestra for the first time since his appointment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/21/arts/21symphonypix/21symphonypix-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f796aacfaf36dc6277c2e5e5ad0a6dbb9eee0e551c875bfbc8d26bc8899f558c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/arts/music/review-esa-pekka-salonen-san-francisco.html,6661d86b-0c9a-5471-a6de-46c698a23ff5.jpg,"SAN FRANCISCO -- After leading his first concert as the San Francisco Symphony's next music director here on Friday, Esa-Pekka Salonen said he had some advice for young conductors. His feet wrapped in impossibly glossy black leather as he spoke in a talkback interview on stage, he almost audibly winced: ""Don't conduct a concert in new shoes."" Even a veteran like Mr. Salonen, 60, couldn't resist dressing up for the first day of school.

The announcement last month that he would be this ensemble's next conductor has been the talk of the music world, both because Mr. Salonen is one of the field's only universally admired figures and because no one thought that he was in the market for a new job. Indeed, leaving in 2009 after 17 years as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, he kept wriggling out when orchestras approached him, saying he wanted time to compose. I and many others hoped he would succeed Alan Gilbert at the New York Philharmonic a couple of years ago; it didn't pan out.

What did, and do, we see in him? Both a steward of music's traditions and an explorer of the future. A vibrant interpreter of the music of others and a creator of his own. An artist who can star more than plausibly in an Apple commercial without seeming a sellout -- one who's thoughtful, even analytical, without ever seeming to try too hard. Almost no one else in classical music so completely satisfies our polarized demands for old and new, innovation and tradition, head and heart. As Mr. Salonen prepared to leave Los Angeles, Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker that he'd become ""a fixed point of cerebral cool in a city of spectacle and flux."" But if his persona has a certain wry distance to it, there is heat in his presence on the podium, and in his effect on orchestras. His connection to the San Francisco Symphony seemed close, confident and charged on Friday, just his fourth time leading the ensemble. (Classical marriages can be shotgun.) If his feet were bothering him, there was no betraying it in the music-making. That he was able to come here for a visit so soon after the announcement last month was happenstance. This weekend of concerts at Davies Symphony Hall was supposed to be conducted by Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla, who has canceled a spread of dates this season (including her debut with the New York Philharmonic) after giving birth in August. Mr. Salonen, who happened to be free, kept the second half of her program -- Sibelius's ""Four Legends from the Kalevala"" -- and preceded it with Anna Thorvaldsdottir's ""Metacosmos"" and Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra.""

The message was clear: No soloist; no concerto (Ms. Grazinyte-Tyla was to have conducted the pianist Gabriela Montero in Tchaikovsky's First); just the orchestra and its next leader. The results had polish and energy. Michael Tilson Thomas, stepping down as music director here after 25 years, has built an ensemble that plays with clean, versatile shine. (It can feel, in its agreeably open versatility, not so far from the Los Angeles Philharmonic.) The San Francisco string sound, in particular, is glistening yet full-bodied, never hysterical but with a lovely glitter to the tone. Russ deLuna played the crucial English horn solo in Sibelius's ""Swan of Tuonela"" movement with self-effacing eloquence. Indeed, solos throughout the concert were alert yet unshowy, always with a sense that the big picture was more important than stealing a star moment. Mr. Salonen conducted the premiere of ""Metacosmos"" in April with the New York Philharmonic, and it makes a clever companion to ""Also Sprach Zarathustra."" Both begin with the same low growl -- though, as Ms. Thorvaldsdottir's orchestra begins to rouse itself into a Strauss-style fanfare, it dolefully falls apart. This cycle of expansion and collapse defines the piece; lush, even cinematic gestures are pulled at by sickly downward moans. This was a powerful, logical ""Zarathustra,"" lithe and bombast-avoidant in a thrillingly controlled opening and airy in the lilting passages later on. Mr. Salonen's Sibelius was lean and fevered. This isn't an orchestra that does spectacular soft atmosphere, but moments like the stillness of the second movement, ""Lemminkainen in Tuonela,"" when the barest shiver of violins is frosted by the barest shiver of rat-a-tat drum, were finely controlled. It was a performance not of effects or jarring contrasts, but of sustained force and focus.

The classical field is now waiting to see what Mr. Salonen will do in his career's full maturity. He has announced a benevolent little think-tank army of artists who will be helping him, including Nico Muhly, Esperanza Spalding and Julia Bullock, and their plans will germinate through next year, as the orchestra turns to celebrating Mr. Thomas's final season. There is room for a refresh here. Mr. Thomas gained a reputation for fostering overlooked 20th-century American works, but on the calendar in Friday's playbill, listing the orchestra's programs through March 9, there's a whole lot of Beethoven, Schumann, Mendelssohn and Mozart, as there is throughout the country. Mr. Salonen's innovations shouldn't stop at concert programming. My hope is that he manages, as no one really has, to do even more with the American orchestra than smart repertory selections and commissions -- that he makes it a clearinghouse of cultural and intellectual activities that extends beyond just music. As the loud reception for him on Friday shows, he has the audience behind him on this new adventure."
57859,A Pretty Package With a Lot of Toy Surprises Inside,"The 2014 Kia Forte competes in a crowed field, and while it may not be the best-performing compact sedan, it is one of the prettiest.",PRETENDER The 2014 Kia Forte looks and feels like a more expensive car.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/23/automobiles/Wheel/Wheel-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=326&w=600&s=8c2e291946a8d45a0eacda8497d1bfd8c4f3c7013d1e272a7ad3d45f66a3f450&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/automobiles/autoreviews/nice-package-with-lots-of-toys-inside.html,21962c18-c5a3-5b5d-9e8a-091310367b17.jpg,"Every automotive underdog might take a hint from the Kia Forte: if you're a back-bencher in a house of big names, it can't hurt to make your car pretty. The Chevrolet Malibu is only the latest cautionary tale of a car that refused to make waves -- and whose creators seemed surprised when sales didn't surge. Sure, the Toyota Camry is every bit as boring as the Malibu, but the Camry's many fans would buy that car in their sleep. Thrown into the compact-car ring, the Kia Forte doesn't merely have to grapple with the Chevrolet Cruze, Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Mazda 3, Toyota Corolla and other familiar models. The Kia has also been overshadowed by its popular Korean cousin, the Hyundai Elantra. But Kia did a smart thing, luring the designer Peter Schreyer from Audi in 2006 to transform its styling. Johan de Nysschen, the executive who guided Audi's stunning rise in the American market -- before leaving to become global leader of Infiniti -- told me in an interview that Audi made a mistake by letting the designer get away. Mr. Schreyer is now global design chief for both Kia and Hyundai.

The 2014 Forte is the latest signed-edition Schreyer that just about everyone agrees is a fine-looking car, whether in the form of a sedan, the two-door Koup or the coming Forte 5 hatchback. One goal of every carmaker is to make the more affordable models look and feel expensive, and almost no one is doing that better than Hyundai and Kia. Thanks to some remarkable upgrades to cars once viewed as disposable, Kia's sales approached 560,000 in the United States last year. That's more than Volkswagen or Dodge and denotes 18 consecutive years of gains -- from a paltry 692 sales in 1994. Ask these companies' separate sales, marketing and distribution executives, and they'll tell you that Hyundai and Kia try to beat each other's brains out, same as any rivals. But with Hyundais and Kias using the same platforms, powertrains, engineers and factories, it's fair to ask what makes them different. For now, exterior and interior design remains a big separator, because the cars tend to perform similarly. If you think the Forte looks better than the Elantra -- or if you prefer Kia's badge to Hyundai's -- then by all means lean that way, or vice versa. If that sounds superficial, note that the warranties are equal: bumper-to-bumper coverage for five years or 60,000 miles; powertrain protection for 10 years or 100,000 miles. But while I admire the Elantra's curves, the Korean-built Forte wins my overall vote, and for more than its solid impression at the curb.

I don't think my eyes are sensitive enough to spot the Kia's roughly two-inch stretch in length and wheelbase from the 2013 version. But from style to features, the Forte comes across as a pricier midsize car trapped in a slightly smaller body. To a point, that effect is also physical: the back seat is especially easy on the knees and elbows. A sprawling trunk (14.9 cubic feet) is larger than those in some midsize cars, and the rear seat folds to expand the space. From its somewhat rowdy engines to a bare-cupboard cabin, the old Forte had a vestigial, Korean-crackerbox feel. Those crumbs have been swept away. The new car feels far more legitimate, with a cabin that surpasses expectations for its class.

Starting at $16,700, the Forte LX shares the Elantra's 1.8-liter engine with 148 horsepower and 131 pound-feet of torque. But the Forte EX, at $20,200, one-ups the Hyundai. The EX adopts a 2-liter in-line 4 with direct injection, 173 horses and 154 pound-feet. That matches the horsepower of the Forte's departing 2.4-liter engine, and the new, downsized engine is smoother and more efficient: it is rated 24 miles per gallon in the city and 36 on the highway, versus a previous rating of 23/32. If you want a 6-speed manual transmission, you're stuck with the LX for now, in keeping with the dubious assumption that only cheapskates want to shift. Other models get a 6-speed automatic. I tested a nearly loaded EX, the Forte's deluxe calling card. And at a sticker price of $25,515, my EX was almost ridiculously well equipped. Buyers may get a kick out of putting their luxury-car-owning pals aboard and showing off the toys, saving the ""gotcha"" line of how little they paid.

The list includes 17-inch alloy wheels and handsome perforated leather seats -- with heated chairs for front and rear passengers. The driver gets 10-way power seats with heating, cooling fans and memory, and the robust leather-wrapped steering wheel includes cruise and audio controls. There's a generous navigation screen with real-time traffic alerts and a backup camera, dual-zone climate control, a 4.2-inch driver's color LCD display and a three-month satellite radio subscription. Don't forget the sunroof, cooled glovebox and smart key with a pushbutton starter. The EX defies more industry assumptions with its new UVO telematics and e-services system, developed with Microsoft. Unlike most subscription-based telematics plans, it's free. Features include 911 notification, onboard diagnostics and dealer service scheduling, Bluetooth streaming and clever phone-based apps like Parking Minder. It guides you to your parked Kia via GPS and computes the time left on parking meters. It can snap and send overhead satellite shots of your car. Outside, high-intensity headlamps are striped with LED marker lights, as if the Forte were an Audi Jr. Puddle lamps shine from power-folding mirrors. That's right: puddle lamps. On a $25,000 Kia. A stiffer structure and more soundproofing allow fewer unwanted decibels to intrude inside. Even the base LX gets 4-wheel disc brakes, and their strength and pedal feel are a high point. But strong brakes and acceleration aside, the Forte's driving dynamics are strictly average. I consulted my notes, but they seemed as blank as my memory, with exclamation points regarding the design and little about how the thing actually drove. The switch to electric steering allows a Flex Steer switch that adjusts power assist across three modes. But as with some other adjustable gimmicks, Sport mode just seems to add glop to the steering -- like artificial thickener being poured in -- instead of actually improving the handling. In the Forte's defense, its steady, sanguine character is par for this class, akin to models like the Cruze and Honda Civic. Only a few cars -- the Ford Focus, Mazda 3 and VW Jetta -- put a sporty stamp on the proceedings."

The directors who've called it home include Brian De Palma, Paul Mazursky, Ira Sachs and Tim Burton. It's no wonder that Peter Newman, a film producer and a professor at New York University, and Antonia Dauphin, a casting agent who is about to direct her first feature, are so comfortable there. However, there is nothing conventionally glamorous about the couple's four-bedroom apartment besides its stellar address and panoramic view of the arch in Washington Square Park. ""If Antonia squints, she can pretend she's in Paris, where she grew up,"" Mr. Newman said. ""The apartment is very basic. It has the spirit of a dormitory."" The couple ""met cute,"" as screenwriters say, at the Deauville American Film Festival in 1984. Mr. Newman was with Robert Altman, on whose ""Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"" he had been a production executive. Ms. Dauphin was with her mother, Ruda Dauphin, a festival director. ""Bob said, 'Ruda's daughter is really cute, you should go introduce yourself.' "" Getting up from the Paul McCobb dining table at the far end of the airy, sparsely furnished living room, Mr. Newman reached for a framed snapshot on the crammed bookcase. ""This was taken the exact second we met,"" he said, grinning. ""We were both too shy to talk to each other.""

Cut to 1988 when they got married in Bedford, N.Y., and moved from Mr. Newman's one-bedroom bachelor pad at 1 Fifth to a two-bedroom apartment on a higher floor. A decade later, when Ms. Dauphin was pregnant with their third child, they persuaded their next-door neighbor to move elsewhere in the building so they could expand into her space. Mr. Newman explains that 1 Fifth was built as an apartment hotel with service pantries, so when they combined the back-to-back kitchenettes they ended up with a modest galley kitchen.

Next to the front door, the kitchen functions like a hallway leading to the windowless family room decorated with movie posters. ""It's where the kids did their homework,"" Ms. Dauphin said. ""We call it the Dumpster."" It connects to three of the four bedrooms via the back hall, which loops back to the living room and foyer. Mr. Newman affectionately describes the kitchen as ""our tragedy."" Ms. Dauphin says their 15-year-old-daughter, Rommily, ""complains about it daily."" Nevertheless, it's where Rommily taught herself to cook beginning at age 9. ""She got tired of my cooking or lack thereof,"" her mother recalled, ""and took it on herself.""

""Now, she's a celebrity chef,"" said Mr. Newman, grabbing his iPad to back up his claim with a video clip from the Food Network. ""She was the youngest contestant to ever appear on 'Chopped,' when she was 13,"" he said, noting that New York magazine recently named her one of the up-and-coming ""teen chefs with adult tastes."" The couple have made up for the apartment's prosaic kitchen by sending Rommily to cooking schools in Paris, Ireland and Tennessee, where they've just built a vacation home at Blackberry Farm, an agritourism resort in the Great Smoky Mountains. Mr. Newman discovered the property when he and his younger son, James, 21, went to Knoxville for a football game. ""James had become obsessed with the University of Tennessee team,"" he explained, ""and we had dinner at Blackberry Farm and told Antonia and Rommily they would love it. When a piece of land there became available, we decided to build a house. Knoxville is an hour-and-40-minute flight from LaGuardia. It's easier to get to than Montauk."" Ms. Dauphin, who has the dreamy demeanor of a poet and seems the antithesis of a ""tiger mom,"" says her children have an obsessive streak. ""They are very self-motivated, but I don't know why,"" she said. ""They were overstimulated from an early age, and growing up in the Village with all the cultural offerings was really wonderful for them. We always felt comfortable letting them wander around the neighborhood. We put a lot of trust in them."" The couple explained that James plans to be a professional sports agent, having already been a TV star and a competitive boxer. ""He was training for the Golden Gloves at 17 when his brother encouraged him to audition for the MTV series 'Skins,' "" Mr. Newman said, ""and he had to give up boxing because his contract forbid him from messing up his face.""

Their supporting roles as doting parents have not hindered their careers. Mr. Newman, who is producing a biopic of Janis Joplin, is the founder and director of a dual-degree program at N.Y.U. through which students pursue an M.B.A. and an M.F.A. in filmmaking simultaneously. ""It's the only one of its kind in the country,"" he said. ""And lucky me, I have the world's best commute -- I just walk across Washington Square Park."" Ms. Dauphin, whose casting credits include ""The Sopranos"" and who works from a small desk next to their bed, is preparing for her directorial debut in February, an adaptation of the 1999 French film ""An Affair of Love."" The cast includes Maria Bello, Dan Stevens from ""Downton Abbey"" and Zosia Mamet from ""Girls."" She is hoping to shoot some of the movie at Sean MacPherson's Marlton Hotel, which recently opened cater-corner to their apartment. ""It has that old Greenwich Village feel,"" said Ms. Dauphin, who laments the loss of the Italian coffee houses that used to dot the neighborhood. ""But Eighth Street has changed for the better. There are only three shoe stores left! Now there are good restaurants -- Greenwich Project, Neta, Stumptown."" For Mr. Newman, the best change in the neighborhood is the renovation of Washington Square Park. ""It used to be noisy and open all night,"" he said. ""Now they close the gates at midnight. It's better for us, but whatever was left of the counterculture is gone. I don't think you will find the next Bob Dylan playing there."" The couple acknowledge that the apartment is overdue for remodeling, but its laissez-faire style was by design. ""I wouldn't want to live in an apartment where you'd be upset if a kid or a dog ruined something,"" Mr. Newman said. ""There is nothing here that is not replaceable. Nothing is precious other than our memories."""

The company said that under its new rules, users would be able to see who had created an ad, how long an ad had been running and how the ad was targeted toward a specific user. Political ads for a candidate or party would carry a special label to make them stand out. Twitter said it would disclose who had paid for the election advertisement and allow users to find information about the buyer, including ad spending history and ad targeting practices. In a blog post outlining its plans, Twitter said it would also create stricter requirements for who could purchase political ads. The company said it would also limit targeting options and create stronger penalties for violators.

Twitter said it would put some of these changes in place in the coming weeks, starting in the United States and then expanding globally.

The standoff is the latest in Spotify wants to get into the audiobooks business, but Apple has rejected its new app three times. The standoff is the latest in a series of confrontations between the companies The announcement is part of a major shift in the industry to lift the veil over how its secretive advertising businesses -- its cash centers -- work, as lawmakers put more pressure on social media companies about the role their sites played in Russia's attempt to influence the election. Twitter, Facebook and Google are scheduled to appear for hearings before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Nov. 1. Lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have expressed frustration about Twitter. In late September, he said Twitter's response was ""inadequate"" when it was asked to provide evidence of Russian-linked advertising and accounts that spread misinformation or were used to favor a presidential candidate. At the time, Twitter said it had discovered about 200 accounts linked to Russian efforts to influence the election. But that figure was significantly less than the number uncovered a month earlier by researchers from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, the public policy research group in Washington. The researchers tracked 600 Twitter accounts -- both human and suspected automated ""bots"" -- that they linked to Russian attempts to influence the election. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said that the company's announcement did not go far enough and that online companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google needed rules that the government could enforce.

Last week, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Warner and Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, introduced a bill that would require digital platforms to report who bought political ads on their sites in the same way that TV broadcast stations must maintain databases with those disclosures. The bill was a response to concern that fake accounts linked to Russia on Facebook and other sites were able to fly past monitors on the sites and easily buy thousands of ads promoting racial and other hot-button issues to sow chaos before the election and to influence the result. ""I welcome this transparency,"" Ms. Klobuchar said, ""but we need a law in place for two major reasons: Not every company will do this, and you need rules for the road."" She added that the companies should not be left to police themselves. The announcement from Twitter followed a public relations blitz this month by Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to announce similar voluntary efforts to tighten standards for ad buyers. Lawmakers are still skeptical, saying there are many unanswered questions about whether the social media sites can prevent the mistakes of the 2016 election on their own. The changes also raise new issues for politicians. For one, advertising agencies often consider their digital strategy part of their ""secret sauce"" when trying to sell their services to politicians and campaign strategists. Shining a light on the types of ads, the amount spent on them and how often they change could give valuable information to competing candidates. It is also unclear whether Twitter will be able to keep up with campaigns' ever-changing digital targeting, budgets and goals, and the company did not mention how it plans to tackle large-scale misinformation spread by bots. Many of those automated accounts, along with Twitter users with suspected ties to the Russian government, bombarded the platform without buying advertising. Researchers at the cybersecurity firm FireEye discovered that hundreds or thousands of fake accounts regularly sent out messages criticizing Hillary Clinton -- sometimes with identical tweets dispatched seconds apart. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said transparency in advertising alone ""is not a solution to the deployment of bots that amplify fake or misleading content or to the successful efforts of online trolls to promote divisive messages."""

Now there is research suggesting that some parents think 13 is too young to see intense shooting, even when it appears justified.

""The findings suggest that parents may want a new rating -- that the film industry is taking inappropriate advantage of the PG-13 system,"" said Daniel Romer, the lead author of the study, which was set for publication on Monday by the journal Pediatrics. He added, ""These movies often get a PG-13 rating by omitting the consequences, such as blood and suffering, and by making the use of gun violence seem justified. But parents of teenagers say that even scenes of justified violence are more appropriate for teens who are at least 15.""

The Motion Picture Association of America, which runs the voluntary domestic film ratings system, declined to comment.

The study, arriving during a renewed national gun debate after the massacre in Parkland, Fla., sought to understand, in part, whether justified gun violence in PG-13 movies was less problematic to parents than the unjustified variety. The researchers, working with support from the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, showed four 90-second clips of the two types of violence to a national sample of 610 parents who had at least one child between ages 6 and 17."

The agency, based in San Francisco, is set to buy back about 70 percent of itself from the Brazilian advertising holding company Grupo ABC, which provided financial backing when Pereira & O'Dell formed in 2008. The agency, which did not say how much it would pay to regain its independence, expects to complete the deal this month.

With the buyback, Pereira & O'Dell will go it alone in an industry dominated by enormous ad-holding companies like Omnicom, Publicis and WPP. Those companies have repeatedly scooped up smaller agencies, becoming behemoths that rule much of the advertising and marketing world.

Pereira & O'Dell, which celebrated its seventh anniversary on Thursday, said its revenue increased 47 percent last year, to $31.6 million, from $21.5 million in 2013. But while the agency will give up resources without Grupo ABC, it will gain autonomy."

What if you could just download your thoughts into images, without the intercession of memory or language? The French artist Pierre Huyghe wondered too, and his new exhibition here, made with the help of some ambitious neuroscientists and some nifty technology, suggests what the images in our heads might look like. Mr. Huyghe has always been a cerebral artist, but his new show here is cerebral in a literal way -- generated from consciousness itself. Mr. Huyghe's exhibition ""Uumwelt,"" which opened last week at the Serpentine Galleries in London's stately Kensington Gardens, offers something uncommon in an art setting: a wholly new kind of imagery. The artist collaborated with Japanese scientists who can translate M.R.I. scans into pictures, and the resultant, restless impressions of brain activity mutate and pullulate from frame to frame. The screens here have their own kind of life, and as you spend longer in the Serpentine's dimmed galleries the very boundaries between images and humans (and other living creatures) start to dissolve. Anyone who cares about the future of either art or neuroscience should see this commanding show, which, like all the best science fictions, offers equal amounts of hope and fright. It represents a return to the controlled spaces of museums after some of Mr. Huyghe's acclaimed recent environmental projects, like his transformation of an abandoned German skating rink into a posthuman ecosystem at last year's Munster Sculpture Project, though this new show, too, is a living garden in its own way.

At the Serpentine, Mr. Huyghe -- it's pronounced WEEG, one syllable, silent H -- has shaded the skylights, busted up some walls, and installed five free-standing LED screens on which images flicker past, dozens of times per second. The images are fuzzy and jerky, often in a Gustonish palette of pinks and reds and grays, and for fleeting milliseconds they seem to depict objects or animals against a plain white background. But they never stay put for long. The images spawn bulbous deformations, then transform again. (A soft, clicking ambient score provides a beat, and links the work to Mr. Huyghe's early videos backed by musique concrete; the walls have been sanded down to reveal earlier paint jobs, and sawdust scents the rooms.)

These images were not made with a camera; what we are looking at are endless frantic attempts to render human thoughts into visual form. Mr. Huyghe collaborated with the neuroscientist Yukiyasu Kamitani, whose lab at Kyoto University has developed artificial intelligence software that decodes human brain activity and renders it as images. In Kyoto Mr. Huyghe had participants enter an M.R.I. scanner and look at pictures or think about ideas; then he used Mr. Kamitani's software to represent the neural activity. The artist has retouched these products of consciousness only slightly; the images I have seen from Mr. Kamitani's lab appear nearly identical to stills of Mr. Huyghe's videos.

They are perplexing to watch, but engrossing. On the first screen I thought I saw a chick or a frog taking shape, though the creature would palpitate into an egg, a lumpen lime or a blastula of germinating cells. The screen in the Serpentine's western gallery appeared to depict a nude of unknown gender; I thought I saw a bra at several points before it blistered for milliseconds at a time. The most abstract of the screens has the appearance of a blurred Gerhard Richter seascape at moments, while the most solidly representational of them oscillates between a Pomeranian puppy and that creepy kid's toy known as Furby. The images are never complete, in a perpetual process of becoming -- and that may be the most human, and disconcerting, thing about them. Many artists today are exploring artificial intelligence, but imagistic expressions of AI in the gallery have been largely trite, relying far too much on received appearances from the video game developers of Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Mr. Huyghe's flickering screens, by anxious contrast, have the breath of life. What we are looking at is 100 dogs, 1,000 seascapes, formed pixel by pixel out of the human brain and an ever-growing database.

Mr. Huyghe shot to prominence in the late 1990s, alongside his Parisian colleagues Philippe Parreno and Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, with a series of videos and performances that revealed the subtle workings of narrative and ideology in contemporary media. In works like ""The Third Memory"" (2000) and ""Streamside Day Follies"" (2003), the artist choreographed scenarios for performers or participants, who would then be free to behave as they wished within his scheme. He would carry through this half-defined, half-open technique in his later environments; now he devises complex collections of living and dead elements, which propagate and transform over time without the artist's intervention. At the Munster skating rink, algae blossomed in standing pools, peacocks strutted about, and human cancer cells metastasized in an incubator.

Ants and bees, an adorable dog and even a mysterious albino penguin have played a critical role in these installations, chosen because animals behave in ways the artist cannot control. Here at the Serpentine, Mr. Huyghe has unleashed some 10,000 flies into the galleries, seen resting on the screens or lying dead under your feet. The museum itself becomes a living, mutating ecosystem, and even the images on the screens are modified throughout the day, triggered by sensors that respond to temperature and humidity. Note the exhibition's title, ""Uumwelt"": the German word for ""environment"" rendered, like the neuroscientific images here, with a stutter. What makes the Serpentine show such a landmark is that it fuses the strains of Mr. Huyghe's art -- the earlier media strain and the later ecological strain -- in a fashion that feels utterly contemporary. He has never given up on images during the environmental phase of his career; his lugubrious ""Untitled (Human Mask),"" completed in 2014, was a relatively straightforward narrative film that tracked a monkey in post-tsunami Fukushima. Yet here at the Serpentine, images themselves have a biological character that makes them more than mere representations of ecological change. The pictures are themselves ""alive,"" biotic, reacting to stimuli and growing in sophistication, and the show thus comprises a grand assemblage of real and artificial intelligences: the Japanese participants and the lab's software, the flies' little brains and our big ones. You begin to understand, as Mr. Huyghe's brain scans wash over you, how images are part of the environment and climate is a kind of culture. Critics aren't supposed to have favorite artists. We're supposed to look without favor, to come to passionate conclusions through dispassionate observation. But I can't deny that Mr. Huyghe, for two decades now, has been the artist I trust most to forge a new art out of our present media chaos and ecological degradation. (I do think he took a wrong turn around 2010 with ""The Host and the Cloud,"" his overwrought 3-hour film with rutting Parisiennes and the Trix bunny, and the boulders and trilobites he placed on the roof of the Met in 2015 were an underwhelming cop-out.) I have checked my gut a lot this week as I've contemplated these freakish moving images, asking myself where the border lies between science and art and whether I cut him too much slack. And what I come back with, still, is that ""Uumwelt"" is a breakthrough of immense importance, because it both charts a path forward for artists and universalizes the act of artistic creation. Early on in ""The Lives of the Artists,"" the foundational text of Renaissance art history, Giorgio Vasari explains that a great artist does not accurately reproduce the world, but draws forth images da se, ""from himself,"" in an act of skilled imagination. What Mr. Huyghe has proved -- confoundingly, thrillingly -- is that artistic creation could be a general tendency, not even limited to our own species, if we provided everyone the right tools. Those flies buzzing about, whose compound eyes can see Mr. Huyghe's flickering screens four times more clearly than we can, could have their own museum exhibition soon."
53351,Antibiotics Resurface as Alternative to Removing Appendix,Five small studies indicate antibiotics can cure some patients with appendicitis; about 70 percent of patients who took pills did not need surgery.,American submarine sailors during the Cold War were given antibiotics for appendicitis.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/19/science/19APPRENDIX-SUB/19APPRENDIX-SUB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=fe03e941cf024db83177c48c73a5ff44b8f8f98695ec59af7496b524ef5cf005&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/health/antibiotics-resurface-as-alternative-to-removing-appendix.html,e1c67e58-9442-5c74-bb2a-59129a3eaf0a.jpg,"Every year, 300,000 Americans with appendicitis are rushed into emergency surgery. Most think that if the appendix is not immediately removed, it will burst -- with potentially fatal consequences. But now some doctors say there may another option: antibiotics. Five small studies from Europe, involving a total of 1,000 patients, indicate that antibiotics can cure some patients with appendicitis; about 70 percent of those who took the pills did not require surgery. Patients who wound up having an appendectomy after trying antibiotics first did not face any more complications that those who had surgery immediately. ""These studies seem to indicate that antibiotics can cure appendicitis in many patients,"" said Dr. David Talan, a specialist in emergency medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""You at least have the chance of avoiding surgery altogether.""

Dr. Talan and other researchers are planning a large clinical trial to compare people with appendicitis who receive antibiotics or surgery. In preparation, Dr. Talan and his colleague Dr. David Flum, a surgeon at the University of Washington, spent much of the past year asking patients if they would be interested in participating. Nearly half said yes. In another survey, nearly three-quarters of those who had already had an appendectomy said they would have preferred to try antibiotics first. By suggesting an antibiotic alternative, the researchers are bucking longstanding medical tradition.

As surgery and anesthesia improved, however, the appendectomy became the treatment of choice. According to the medical thinking of the day, it made sense. For years, doctors thought the appendix -- a tiny worm-shaped tube that hangs off the right side of the colon -- became inflamed because it was blocked by a small piece of hardened feces. As it turns out, though, the vast majority of people with appendicitis do not have such a blockage. ""No one knows what causes appendicitis,"" said Dr. James Barone, a retired chairman of surgery at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut and Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx. And an inflamed appendix is not, as most people think, a ticking time bomb. While perforation occurs in 15 percent to 25 percent of patients, researchers hypothesize that those who get perforations may have a predisposing immune response or infection with certain kinds of bacteria. In others, appendicitis goes away on its own. Nor is the length of time that an appendix is inflamed necessarily linked to the risk of perforation. Most people with a ruptured appendix already have it when they show up in the emergency room. But surprising as antibiotics might seem, this is not the first time they have emerged as a possible alternative to an appendectomy.

When antibiotics became available in the 1940s and '50s, doctors in England began giving them to patients with appendicitis, reporting excellent results. During the Cold War, when American sailors spent six months or more on nuclear submarines prohibited from surfacing, those who developed appendicitis were given antibiotics. ""Those submariners did great, and no deaths or complications were reported,"" Dr. Flum said. But that did not put a dint in the perception that surgery was the treatment of choice. In 1961 a Russian doctor stationed in Antarctica, Leonid Rogozov, went so far as to cut out his own appendix when it became inflamed. ""I work mainly by touch. The bleeding is quite heavy, but I take my time,"" he wrote in his journal. ""I grow weaker and weaker, my head starts to spin ...Finally, here it is, the accursed appendix."" The planned clinical trial pitting antibiotics against surgery will attempt to answer important questions. Are antibiotics as good as surgery in curing appendicitis? Could they do so at less cost, avoiding a hospitalization afterward? How often does appendicitis recur after a person is treated with antibiotics? Will patients successfully treated with antibiotics later rush to the emergency room every time they feel abdominal pain?

""Once he found out I didn't have insurance, it was easy to talk him into prescribing me antibiotics,"" Mr. Redelfs said. He felt better almost immediately. But six months later, Mr. Redelfs felt a twinge in his abdomen and returned to the hospital. This time, he had insurance. Told he had appendicitis again, he opted for surgery. ""I wanted the peace of mind,"" he said."

He was 74. Ackerman McQueen, the Oklahoma City advertising company that Mr. McQueen had long led, announced the death. He had had lung cancer. Mr. McQueen's death came amid a legal fight between the N.R.A. and Ackerman McQueen that would have not long ago been considered inconceivable. The two organizations had been so close for nearly 40 years that some of the most recognized faces associated with the N.R.A., including its former spokeswoman Dana Loesch and its former president Oliver L. North, were actually on Ackerman's payroll, not the N.R.A.'s.

But an N.R.A. lawsuit this year against Ackerman over its billing practices led to infighting within the gun organization and threatened the leadership of its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, who had been a friend and longtime client of Mr. McQueen's. Moreover, it divided Mr. McQueen's family and has put severe financial strains on his company. Mr. McQueen cut his teeth as a director and producer for NBC affiliates and served in the Nixon administration, where he directed pool coverage of the Republican National Convention in Miami Beach in 1972. He joined Ackerman McQueen in 1973, a company co-founded by his father, Marvin. After serving as creative director, Angus became president in 1984 and chief executive in 1987, helping to build it from a company of about 25 employees to one of about 250. He was the agency's creative director during the original pitch meeting to the N.R.A. The gun group saw Ackerman McQueen as more in sync with its values than ad firms on the East and West Coasts. Ackerman was deeply involved in developing the N.R.A.'s image over the years. It worked with the actor Charlton Heston during his combative presidency of the organization. It devised the ""I'm the N.R.A."" ad campaign, which tried to humanize the group, and featured celebrities like Roy Rogers. And it gave Mr. LaPierre's image a makeover, putting him in tailored suits.

The company also helped turn the N.R.A.'s annual conventions into sprawling gatherings, with this year's event, in Indianapolis, boasting of 15 acres of guns. ""I speak to Wayne almost every day,"" Mr. McQueen said in a 2002 deposition, in litigation brought by the N.R.A. and other groups against the Federal Election Commission. ""On numerous occasions, we'll speak throughout the day,"" he added. Describing how the N.R.A. used advertising to influence voters, he said in the same deposition: ""I tell people all the time: No voter is a light switch. No voter is on and off."" Instead, he likened voters to a dimmer switch ""that gets brighter and softer and that throbs throughout the process."" ""And so what you want, when you're an advocate of the Second Amendment,"" he added, ""is for the citizenry to become as informed as they possibly can be on the issue."" Angus Loren McQueen was born in 1944 in Superior, Wis., to Marvin and Mary Louise McQueen. He did not attend college. As a young man he was a writer and director with the Navy Office of Information in Washington during the Vietnam War. He was later a producer for an NBC television affiliate in Houston directing coverage of the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft missions.

He is survived by his son, Revan, who is the current chief executive of Ackerman McQueen; his daughters Skye Brewer and Loren Zanotti; and seven grandchildren. His wife, Jodi (Hetzke) McQueen, a former model and actress, died in 2013. Over the years, Ackerman's major clients included the Chickasaw Nation, for whom the agency developed an Oklahoma travel site that helped steer interest to the tribe. The Integris health care system of Oklahoma was another client. Stan Hupfeld, a former chief executive of Integris, said Mr. McQueen had focused on telling the stories of doctors and patients rather than solely on extolling the system's technological abilities. ""You have to touch people on a personal basis, and I thought his organization was very skilled at that,"" Mr. Hupfeld said. Mark Keller, a music producer and voiceover specialist who once worked for Mr. McQueen and became a close friend, said, ""It's hard for me to think of anyone else more adept at putting together talented people."" He recalled collaborating with Mr. McQueen on a campaign for a Texas company, Nocona Boots, that was criticized by environmentalists for magazine ads depicting boot-wearing ranchers battling the likes of rattlesnakes and Gila monsters. ""Big news -- cowboys kill rattlesnakes, they don't protect them,"" Mr. Keller said in an interview, adding, ""We were just trying to sell some cowboy boots, and it worked."" Mr. McQueen championed building media platforms for his clients, none more high profile then NRATV, a live broadcasting arm that caused friction even within the N.R.A. for straying beyond gun rights into rightwing politics."
58148,"Layoffs Taboo, Japan Workers Are Sent to the Boredom Room","Facing a sluggish economy and increasing competition, Japan's prime minister and major companies want to reduce longstanding restrictions on dismissing full-time workers.",Miwako Sato joined Sony right out of high school in 1974.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/17/business/Banish/Banish-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=326&w=600&s=c03e55456cbd6b7ba41b8ace8d9fe8982c0bb2f399f8484079b0c7582625f971&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html,888646a2-df33-57e4-9cc5-eb7effc0dc9b.jpg,"TAGAJO, Japan -- Shusaku Tani is employed at the Sony plant here, but he doesn't really work. For more than two years, he has come to a small room, taken a seat and then passed the time reading newspapers, browsing the Web and poring over engineering textbooks from his college days. He files a report on his activities at the end of each day. Sony, Mr. Tani's employer of 32 years, consigned him to this room because they can't get rid of him. Sony had eliminated his position at the Sony Sendai Technology Center, which in better times produced magnetic tapes for videos and cassettes. But Mr. Tani, 51, refused to take an early retirement offer from Sony in late 2010 -- his prerogative under Japanese labor law. So there he sits in what is called the ""chasing-out room."" He spends his days there, with about 40 other holdouts. ""I won't leave,"" Mr. Tani said. ""Companies aren't supposed to act this way. It's inhumane."" The standoff between workers and management at the Sendai factory underscores an intensifying battle over hiring and firing practices in Japan, where lifetime employment has long been the norm and where large-scale layoffs remain a social taboo, at least at Japan's largest corporations.

Sony wants to change that, and so does Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. As Japan's economic recovery slows, reducing the restraints on companies has become even more important to Mr. Abe's economic plans. He wants to loosen rigid rules on job terminations for full-time staff. Economists say bringing flexibility to the labor market in Japan would help struggling companies streamline bloated work forces to better compete in the global economy. Fewer restrictions on layoffs could make it easier for Sony to leave loss-ridden traditional businesses and concentrate resources on more innovative, promising ones. ""I have a single wish for Japan's electronics sector, and that's labor reform,"" said Atul Goyal, a technology analyst at Jefferies & Company. Sony said it was not doing anything wrong in placing employees in what it calls Career Design Rooms. Employees are given counseling to find new jobs in the Sony group, or at another company, it said. Sony also said that it offered workers early retirement packages that are generous by American standards: in 2010, it promised severance payments equivalent to as much as 54 months of pay. But the real point of the rooms is to make employees feel forgotten and worthless -- and eventually so bored and shamed that they just quit, critics say. Labor practices in Japan contrast sharply with those in the United States, where companies are quick to lay off workers when demand slows or a product becomes obsolete. It is cruel to the worker, but it usually gives the overall economy agility. Some economists attribute the lack of a dynamic economy in Western Europe to labor laws similar to Japan's that restrict layoffs.

New York had ""rubber rooms"" where it put teachers who would sit -- with full pay -- while the city tried to fire them. The practice was ended in 2010. The United Auto Workers and automakers had created, under union contracts, places where idled workers were essentially warehoused. Sony, a sprawling company with more than 146,000 employees, is under pressure. It has been outmaneuvered by more nimble competitors and its executives are trying to remake the company. Fixing Sony is especially critical after it snubbed the American activist investor Daniel S. Loeb's push to spin off part of Sony's entertainment business. Its shares have fallen almost 10 percent since Sony rejected his proposal earlier this month. Critics of labor changes say something more important is at stake. They warn that making it easier to cut jobs would destroy Japan's social fabric for the sake of corporate profits, causing mass unemployment and worsening income disparities. For a country that has long prided itself on stability and relatively equitable incomes, such a change would be unacceptable. ""That's not the kind of country Japan should aim to be,"" said Takaaki Matsuda, who leads the Sendai chapter of Sony's union. It would be a radical change. A combination of lifetime employment, seniority-based pay and intense worker loyalty to the company was credited for Japan's postwar economic miracle, as stability and growth went hand in hand. But when the Japanese economy stumbled in the early 1990s, companies found that Japan's rigid labor practices made downsizing impractical. Instead, unneeded workers were left with little to do besides gaze out of the window, giving rise to the term ""madogiwa zoku"" or the ""window seat tribe."" Proponents of employment change point out that stiff protections for workers have prompted companies to make major cuts in hiring, shrinking opportunities for scores of younger Japanese. Sony hired 160 fresh college graduates this fiscal year, compared with about 1,000 in 1991. Companies have also adjusted by using a secondary class of temporary or part-time workers they can more easily let go. ""In reality, hidden inequalities already exist in Japan,"" said Fumio Ohtake an economist at Osaka University.

Still, some fear that Mr. Abe's changes are not so much pro-market as just pro-business. A weaker yen has brought exporters like Sony windfall profits, yet no substantial increases in salary have followed, and many manufacturers continue to shift production overseas. The delicacy of labor changes has forced Mr. Abe to tread gingerly. He took the issue off the agenda when he focused on parliamentary elections in July. After a big win for his party, it is back. But a new plan under discussion would ease firing rules only in Japan's three biggest cities. Japan's biggest companies appear to be imitating Sony. Local media reports say many of them, including Panasonic, NEC and Toshiba, use the oidashibeya, or chase-out rooms, and similar tactics. In May, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that an employee at a Panasonic unit was being required to spend his days in a room staring at monitors to catch irregularities. Last year, a Tokyo court ordered Benesse, an educational services company, to reinstate a worker who claimed she had been required to do demeaning, menial tasks after resisting pressure to leave. Panasonic could not be reached for comment over its summer holiday period. Benesse said it had since revised its personnel practices. While details to the government plans are still being determined, Mr. Tani's managers at Sony are already upping the ante. Starting this month, the company has ordered him to work 12-hour shifts on an assembly line at a Sony plant in Toyosato, more than an hour's drive away. He says he will comply. For Miwako Sato, who joined Sony right out of high school in 1974, the changes are a betrayal of an accepted social contract in Japan.

A new generation of champions emerge in ""Stargirl,"" the CW's latest entry into the superhero genre. The TV series stars several DC Comics heroes led by Stargirl, who is based on the comics character created by Geoff Johns. She is a teenager named Courtney Whitmore (Brec Bassinger), who teams with her seemingly not-so-cool new stepfather, Pat Dugan (Luke Wilson), to hunt down the villains who wiped out an earlier group of heroes, the Justice Society of America. But her motive is not purely altruistic: Courtney believes her father, who disappeared the day the team died, may have secretly been one of the crime fighters. Along the way, she finds new heroes to inherit the Society's capes and cowls. ""The idea of legacy is front and center,"" said Johns, who wrote the pilot and serves as showrunner, his first time overseeing a series. ""Stargirl"" premieres Monday on DC Universe and Tuesday on the CW. Johns created Stargirl in his first comic book series, Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E., from 1999. The character was informed partly by Star Spangled Comics from 1941, which featured a child hero and adult sidekick. ""I've always been a fan of finding these old, kind of forgotten or overlooked ideas from DC's history and polishing them up,"" he said.

In a recent telephone interview, Johns talked about his sister, his stint as an assistant to the film director Richard Donner and his love of comic book lore. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. What aspects of your sister Courtney did you put into Stargirl? My sister was a ball of energy and so optimistic and unafraid. I wanted to try to capture some of that in a character that would be around forever.

Is giving the character flaws difficult since she is based on your sister? No, my sister had plenty of flaws, but also the character, once you start to write her, takes on a life of her own. I find Courtney to be one of the easiest characters to write because she's always going to try; to me, that is a really inspiring trait. She sees the potential in this old sidekick Pat Dugan where others haven't. She sees potential in the high school kids who have been overlooked that she recruits into the Justice Society. She finds value in people that others have dismissed.

You wrote the part of Pat Dugan, the stepfather, for Luke Wilson. Why did you have him in mind? When I first came to L.A., I saw ""Bottle Rocket"" and I just fell in love with him as an actor. He brings this real grounded earnestness and likability and humbleness. And he's funny! So when I was writing Pat Dugan, I always envisioned him. When I wrote the pilot, I sent him the script. We ended up having lunch together and he came with all these hilarious ideas about one of the other characters in the series, Pat Dugan's son, Mike [Trey Romano], who's like this 45-year-old man in a 14-year-old body. He even picked the Johnny Cash song in Episode 2. A version of Stargirl appeared in a 2010 episode of ""Smallville"" that you wrote. What is different about how Brec Bassinger embodies the character? It was fun to see Stargirl onscreen for the first time, but it was very different because she was a supporting character. Thematically, this is a very different experience. We're lucky to have found Brec -- she came in and delivered the emotion, the warmth, the drama, the comedy and the strength that Stargirl and Courtney needed.

The cast of ""Stargirl"" is notably diverse. Was that a priority? Our lead is Stargirl, so, you know, I do not have to wave a flag to say, ""Look, we have a female lead!"" But it was important to have a diverse set of characters around her, and I wanted to take characters from the comics that I loved and some I never had a chance to write. Yolanda Montez/Wildcat [played by Yvette Monreal] was killed off early in the comics and was forgotten about, as was Beth Chapel, the new Doctor Midnight [Anjelika Washington]. Both characters had a lot of untapped potential. The other thing about Yolanda and Beth and even Rick Tyler [Cameron Gellman] is that they're not super defined in the lore, so it gave us the latitude to make the best versions for this show.

This is your first time as a showrunner. What was that like? It was an incredible learning process. I moved to Atlanta for production because I wanted to make sure that our tone was proper, that we were protecting the scenes we needed to and that the directors and everyone understood what we're trying to accomplish. We tried to raise the bar on production, too -- I wanted to bring a cinematic look and feel to the show. I hope we can do many more seasons of it.

Did your time as Richard Donner's assistant influence how you approached this production? I was his assistant on ""Conspiracy Theory"" and ""Lethal Weapon 4"" and I was on set, and his attitude was amazing. I learned from some of the best people: from Dick to Patty Jenkins to Greg Berlanti and so many others. I co-wrote ""WW1984"" with Patty and Dave Callaham, and it was one of the most intense and fun experiences I've had writing. I've worked with Greg on TV since he was developing ""Arrow."" We developed ""The Flash"" together and ""Titans"" with Akiva Goldsman and we've worked on several other DC shows. Greg's passion and experience were invaluable during ""Stargirl."" Does your approach to writing change when you're doing a comic or a TV show? With comic books, you have a finite number of pages and a finite number of panels. There is no budget, but there are limitations to what you can do in terms of the format. You can't do silent moments as much because it eats up so many pages. With TV, you definitely have budget constraints. Once you figure out how to write within the budget, it gets easier. What's the geekiest thing that you've included in the series? There's a lot of stuff in the J.S.A. headquarters that digs really deep. Our goal was to embrace the material, from the opening scene, with our version of the swamp creature Solomon Grundy, to the pink pen carrying the magical Thunderbolt. When we get into the Seven Soldiers, that digs deep. But we try to do it in a way that is emotionally relevant. It wasn't just throwing in Easter eggs; everything is a story to be told."
48594,L.A. Dance Project Takes On Merce Cunningham,The Los Angeles troupe has been dancing anthologies culled from Mr. Cunningham's 1950s choreography.,"Silas Riener performing Merce Cunningham's ""Changeling"" at the Hammer Museum.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/25/arts/25mercenotebook-web1/25mercenotebook-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=63c22c58047e18a0907e4101c53987a247445ae19424f0104b4847e6e912c666&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/arts/dance/la-dance-project-takes-on-merce-cunningham.html,97816b04-5c9f-5398-bd1c-c39b4ff7b484.jpg,"A duet from ""Suite for Five"" (1956) begins with a woman perched on a man's shoulder. Her legs are stretched back into the air behind her. Her torso arches up to present her face and shoulders to the front. This is a heroic lift you can see in several ballets -- but the resemblance stops beneath the waist. The difference here is that the man is kneeling. The effect is weird, truncating, fascinating.

As that number develops, you can't miss its complete independence from music or the exploratory drama it creates by setting its dancers forth on separate routes. A trio from ""Suite"" keeps changing in structure. Now it's a duet and a solo; now a tight-woven trio; now three separate solos in different paths and meters that nonetheless connect in overlapping orbits.

The special element of these performances is a rarity, a duet from ""Springweather and People"" (1954), originally danced (like the ""Suite"" duet) by Cunningham and Carolyn Brown. This duet was lost for decades until, two years ago, the researcher and filmmaker Alla Kovgan found a 1958 film of it. Part of it was danced again, beautifully, by Boston Conservatory students in the October-January edition of this ""Leap Before You Look"" exhibition at Boston's Institute of Contemporary Arts. But it's only now, with these Los Angeles performers, that the whole duet has returned to the stage. And now we can feel the complex structure of it, with its couplings and solos, its intimacies and its distances.

Though some still use the word ""abstract"" to describe plotless choreography, Cunningham, like the choreographer George Balanchine before him and Mark Morris today, observed that humans dancing cannot be abstract. Cunningham, more than any other dance-maker, created works that operated on multiple levels. Sometimes there's nothing but this movement; but the sheer physics of it make for drama. With the ""Suite"" excerpts, that's continually true. This remains extraordinarily fresh: Dancers switch angles and routes, and present jumps and floor work, as if we were in the laboratory with them.

Sometimes, as often in the ""Springweather"" duet, we can't help seeing imagery, character and narrative. Is this movement for its own sake or is it a window to meaning? The ambiguity is essential to Cunningham dance theater. I love a moment in this dance where the woman, in profile to us, holds a formally pure arabesque. The man, approaching her from behind, places a protective hand around her torso to support her hip. She stretches her neck tenderly back toward him; we're close here to the narrative of ""Swan Lake."" But then, still holding that arabesque, she hops softly away. The story changes."
10136,A Black Pianist Helped Birth Bossa Nova. His Story Is Rarely Told.,"Johnny Alf has always been revered by Antônio Carlos Jobim and João Gilberto, but his legacy remains obscure, even among Brazilians.","Johnny Alf, at the piano, was a bossa nova pioneer who never achieved the fame of his acclaimed peers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/28/arts/00alf1/00alf1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=726d5ab60e07224a0d6fb7453030660a0ec7b6f483e89e2f55ad73f3aba3ad3c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/arts/music/johnny-alf-bossa-nova.html,0c4981a6-9733-5671-8ab6-34f56e3a8d04.jpg,"Johnny Alf has always been revered by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joao Gilberto, but his legacy remains obscure, even among Brazilians.

Joao Gilberto's landmark ""Chega de Saudade"" is widely considered bossa nova's first album. But about seven years before its 1959 release, a Brazilian musician known as Johnny Alf composed ""Rapaz de Bem."" The song incorporated several elements that became hallmarks of the genre: a linear melody, a gentle way of singing, a series of unconventional key changes, a rhythmic dissociation of drums and bass. Alf, a pianist, composer and singer, dared to blend classical, popular, foreign and local music references into his own creative process. The source of his inspiration lies in the music of Chopin, Debussy, Nat King Cole, Stan Kenton, and the Brazilian notables Custodio Mesquita and Francisco Alves. His music attracted the most avant-garde ears to the piano bars of the Copacabana neighborhood in Rio, where he regularly performed in the early '50s. Antonio Carlos Jobim, who was also known as Tom, and Gilberto -- now known as two of the most famous names in bossa nova -- were among the faithful habitues who were stunned by songs like ""Rapaz de Bem,"" one of Alf's first professional compositions and, the radio host and music producer Ramalho Neto argues in the 1965 book ""Historinha do Desafinado,"" the actual first bossa nova song.

Like his music, Alf's story was complex. He was born Alfredo Jose da Silva to a poor Black housemaid. His father died when he was 3, and he owed much of his musical education to his mother's employers -- an upper-middle-class family who paid for his piano lessons and helped raise him, though they later strongly disapproved of his nightclub career. (They expected Alf to become an accountant or an English teacher.) But music was intrinsic to Alf's life long before his debut in the clubs of Copacabana. When he was only a high school student, he was invited to play the piano at the Brazilian-United States Institute (IBEU), in Rio's downtown. Sessions there earned him his first radio gig and generated his artist name: ""Johnny"" was suggested by a fellow student for being a popular name in America, and ""Alf"" was his nickname at the school. In 1949, Alf, a connoisseur of American music, joined the Sinatra-Farney Fan Club, a place to appreciate, discuss and play the music of Frank Sinatra and Dick Farney, a Brazilian pianist and singer inspired by the American star. It was here that Alf's music began to flourish, and his sound developed a striking modernity. According to Jose Domingos Raffaelli, a music critic and former Sinatra-Farney attendee, Alf used to perform for hours as listeners begged him to play on. In 1952, thanks to a recommendation from Farney himself, Alf got his first job at a Copacabana piano bar called Cantina do Cesar. Three years later, Alf moved to Sao Paulo with the promise of making a better living. By then he was an independent musician in his mid-20s with no family support. In 1958, when bossa nova was gaining momentum in Rio, Alf was 270 miles away -- far enough to miss out on the movement.

But distance wasn't the only barrier Alf faced. Joao Carlos Rodrigues, the author of ""Johnny Alf: Duas ou Tres Coisas Que Voce Nao Sabe"" (""Johnny Alf: Two or Three Things You Don't Know""), believes the sophistication of Alf's music was a significant obstacle, because the radio and record companies preferred a more ""easily digestible"" music. Marcos Napolitano, a social history professor at the University of Sao Paulo who researches music movements in Brazil, agreed. ""It is undeniable that Alf's work was more subtle, intimate and sophisticated,"" he said in an email interview, ""apart from him being a timid, standoffish performer."" Alf's personality offstage -- where he boldly insisted on creative freedom -- also limited him. ""No one called me to record because I only did what I wanted,"" he told Rodrigues. Nelson Valencia, who managed Alf's career for over 20 years, said in a phone interview that Alf didn't naturally chase opportunities, but rather waited for them to appear. He added that his client also could have pushed harder to explore the growing Japanese and American markets. In 1963, Alf did record an album in English (with Jobim's compositions) that has never been released. In the late '70s, when Sarah Vaughan, one of his greatest idols, invited him to tour the United States, Alf was warned to refuse it by his mae de santo -- the priestess of Umbanda, the Afro-Brazilian religion to which he was devoted -- and he didn't go.

Alf was also Black, poor and gay in an industry aiming to attract affluent white audiences to the genre. Napolitano said that in the late '50s, the music business saw in bossa nova a chance to compete with American rock 'n' roll, and Valencia acknowledged that race and class inequalities restricted Alf's rise: ""There was a movement to promote Tom Jobim, who was rich, white, young, good-looking,"" he said, and added that with Alf's abilities, ""maybe he was someone who could overshadow Tom Jobim."" Alf's talent, Rodrigues said, could also have been a problem for Aloysio de Oliveira, an influential bossa nova producer who was particularly interested in promoting Jobim and Gilberto in the United States. Alf was excluded from the landmark ""Bossa Nova at Carnegie Hall"" concert, organized by Sidney Frey (with Oliveira acting as a mediator between artists and the production) and held in New York in 1962. Alaide Costa, Alf's favorite singer, said that racism in bossa nova has always been veiled, to the point where Black people, like her and Alf, didn't even realize they were facing discrimination. ""When the movement began, I was already a professional. I used to be invited to the meetings because I could help the movement somehow,"" she said in a phone interview. ""But when the bossa nova boomed, I felt I was no longer necessary."" She added that she regrets not having been part of the movement in a larger way. While Alf never achieved stardom, the genre's legends always saw him as a musical guru. Jobim not only used to call him Genialf (a combination of ""genius"" and ""Alf""), but was so inspired by ""Rapaz de Bem"" that he composed ""Desafinado (Off-Key),"" one of bossa nova's most famous songs. When Gilberto realized that Alf's unusual syncopations reminded him of the beat of the tamborim (a samba percussion instrument), he said he had finally found what he was looking for. Alf, however, has remained a few steps removed from fame. He was, Valencia, said, ""his own hero and own villain."""
16458,Why Puerto Rico Is No. 1 on Our Places to Go List,"Recovering from Hurricane Maria, in 2019 the island represents so many fragile spots around the globe.",The Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/travel/13puertoessay1/13puertoessay1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=86dca2da4c5333a499d15c07119089b746ffb40de15e51c5d0cf262c3b2f7314&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/travel/visit-puerto-rico.html,4618431c-8d17-524a-a99d-629029ba187e.jpg,"Why Puerto Rico Is No. 1 on Our Places to Go List

For as long as I can remember growing up in Puerto Rico, El Morro, the indestructible fort with the endless lawns at the entrance to San Juan harbor, was where you went to fly a kite. And on a recent sunny afternoon, just as expected, a couple and their young son were there trying to catch an updraft to loft a plastic butterfly with a long blue tail into the sky. On Fortaleza Street, an art installation of colorful umbrellas hovered above pedestrians, triggering countless selfies. A short ferry ride away from the old city, at the Bacardi rum distillery in the town of Catano, visitors sipped cocktails in an open-air pavilion with a roof shaped like a bat in flight. But as Puerto Rico tries to come back as a premier Caribbean destination after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria in Sept. 2017, just a short drive from the pricey beachfront hotels, hundreds of residents are still living under leaky tarps, their poverty on display in glaring bright blue.

The tourists celebrating birthdays would not know that the coffee farms will take years to recover -- and the red mangrove forests decades -- or that commercial fishermen in the town of Luquillo still can't get their usual haul of lobster, octopus and conch. After the Juan Martin River jumped its banks during the hurricane and took over the dirt road to the beach, the fishermen said, access is so difficult that they need to car pool on four-wheel drive vehicles or they can't fish as much.

Why should tourists worry about any of this? Isn't a Caribbean vacation by definition an escape from life's troubles? But in the juxtaposition of its two worlds, the tropical paradise versus the struggling island, Puerto Rico is representative of the many fragile places around the globe right now: The islands facing a future of sea level rise and extreme weather. The arctic spots where winter itself is under threat. The cities where a combination of climate change and bad planning has resulted in devastation.

That is why Puerto Rico earned the No. 1 spot on our annual list of 52 Places to visit in the coming year. The island, and the other beautiful destinations now at risk raise an urgent question: Do we owe something to the places that make us happy?

""This is the new normal and people have to look at this new normal and embrace it,"" said Martha Honey, executive director of the Center for Responsible Travel in Washington, D.C. The trend in travel has skewed in recent years toward more awareness and sensitivity -- eco-tourism, voluntourism, agritourism, the idea that as visitors we should not cause harm and should seek out authentic experiences that get us deep into the local culture. Perhaps it would not be such a stretch to redefine the relationship between leisure travelers and their dream destinations. Traveling more consciously is not such a heavy lift, experts like Ms. Honey said. A baby step would be to take account of the realities of the place and then incorporate them into itineraries and more targeted spending -- get out of the resort, patronize local businesses, reward hotels set back from the ocean with a stay.

If tourists did what Puerto Ricans like me do when they sightsee, they would eat roasted whole pig (""lechon asado"") in Guavate south of San Juan or seafood in the southern town of Salinas or bar-hop in the mountains among roadside restaurants and food shacks (""chinchorreo""). Many will find that this new way of travel can lead to better vacations because it helps build a connection to the place, Ms. Honey said. Tour operators say that those traveling this winter to Puerto Rico and other islands damaged by Hurricane Maria tend to be ""repeats and loyalists"" going back to what they already love. After a temporary drop, said Jack Richards, president and CEO of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which handles travel to 23 islands in the Caribbean, bookings started picking up last June and ""Caribbean tourism is back with a vengeance now.""

""Everybody understands that the best way to help Puerto Rico is to book there and help the local economy,"" he said. Organizations that help tourists combine sightseeing with volunteer work, such as Para La Naturaleza, a nonprofit that works on reforestation, are reporting higher demand. There are now more opportunities to help. Having survived the worst of the hurricane largely on their own as the government's response faltered, residents' self-reliance or ""auto-gestion"" efforts have kicked into high gear, with many communities organizing and welcoming help to install solar lights, plant native trees, clear trails and launch rebuilding projects."

The narrow streets are easy to navigate and dense with local businesses, including a high concentration of vintage shops, unusual specialty stores and small boutiques stocked with wares from young artists and artisans. Many consider this the coolest neighborhood in Tokyo, and when you browse some of the most interesting shops, it's hard to disagree.

In a neighborhood overflowing with secondhand shops, this beautifully arranged vintage store stands out for its well-chosen collection of clothing, shoes and accessories, mainly from the 1950s to 1970s. Equally impressive is the enviable style of the employees, who dress the part in headscarves, floral midi-skirts and round granny glasses."
8436,Does Cinéma Vérité Exist? Watch These 2 Movies to Find Out,"The documentary style is eye-opening as it tests the boundaries of nonfiction filmmaking. Try ""Crisis"" and ""Salesman"" to start.",John F. Kennedy at a tense moment in &ldquo;Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment.&rdquo;,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/26/arts/25gateway-verite3/25gateway-verite3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=344bc71f1053e865da4add617d25b34cb66b3c1acf526b21c1ae0cb7b4801b4c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/movies/cinema-verite.html,83e80bbf-19b5-5bd6-882d-3a68a8a99c59.jpg,"For a genre that ostensibly presents snippets of unvarnished truth, a particular type of documentary is difficult to name. The opening of ""Chronicle of a Summer"" (1961), a groundbreaking example by the anthropologist Jean Rouch and the sociologist Edgar Morin, calls it ""cinema verite."" To the brothers Albert and David Maysles, it was ""direct cinema."" Frederick Wiseman has used the phrase ""reality fictions."" But in a 2015 interview, he told me he meant that term in jest: If Truman Capote could describe ""In Cold Blood"" as a nonfiction novel, then surely Wiseman could say his own films -- shot unobtrusively, then edited with an eye toward characterization -- added a novelistic spin to reality. Whatever you call it, this type of filmmaking, if it's indeed one type of filmmaking, became possible in the 1950s, when light 16-millimeter cameras and the ability to capture sound on the fly let documentarians test the boundaries of the form. Typically, the ""verite"" label gets slapped on documentaries that avoid re-enactments or interviews, and instead favor real-life scenes as they unfold. Truth or fiction, one genre or several, these movies raise fascinating questions about cinema's capacity to accurately mirror the world. They also make for active, exciting viewing. ""Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment"" (1963): Stream it on the Criterion Channel or HBO Max; rent or buy it on Amazon, Google Play or iTunes. ""Salesman"" (1969): Stream it on the Criterion Channel, HBO Max or Kanopy; rent or buy it on Amazon or iTunes. Perhaps the simplest attribute of verite is its ability to capture unguarded, candid moments. For that, look to the films of Robert Drew, who, along with associates like Richard Leacock and D.A. Pennebaker, established the verite style in the United States.

Drew and company pursue several lines of action. They follow Wallace, both at home and in public, as he grandstands about the South's bravery in the Civil War and greets admirers who are presumably fans of his racism; Robert F. Kennedy, attorney general at the time, as he and President John F. Kennedy strategize on the best way to maintain control of a confrontation that could, if it backfires, embarrass the federal government; and Nicholas Katzenbach, then the deputy attorney general, whose job was to escort the students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, to the building where they would register. (If the film were made today, the students' perspectives would surely have played a more central role.) Amid the crosscutting, ""Crisis"" captures a wealth of informal texture: Bobby Kennedy, trying to work while his young daughter Kerry is distracting him, briefly puts her on the phone with Katzenbach. (""Hi, Nick!"" ""Hi, Kerry. How are you, dear?"") Perhaps the quintessential introduction to the issues posed by direct cinema is ""Salesman,"" which is also a great place to think about the verite style as artistry. (Even the title card takes an auteurist possessive: ""The Maysles Brothers' 'Salesman.'"") Directed with Charlotte Zwerin, the Maysles' film follows four door-to-door salesmen -- nicknamed ""the Badger,"" ""the Gipper,"" ""the Rabbit"" and ""the Bull"" -- who work for the Mid-American Bible Company. Their assignment: selling large illustrated Bibles for $49.95 (around $380 today).

Paul Brennan, ""the Badger,"" is the first and last subject seen, and the one whose desperation emerges most vividly as drama. Whether driving through the snow or spouting dialogue worthy of Arthur Miller (""They say Alaska's good territory""), he prefigures Shelley Levene, the haggard, over-the-hill salesman of David Mamet's ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" Shooting in black-and-white, the directors film with an eye to aesthetics: There are stunning shots of Paul, in the shadows and apparently lost in thought, as his train pulls into Chicago's Union Station for a sales meeting. (You would have to know Chicago to recognize the mordancy of the gathering's location, the Edgewater Beach Hotel -- a fading resort for the rich and famous that by then had fallen on hard times. In keeping with the verite style, such context is never offered.) The question of whether the camera influences action in ""Salesman"" is fascinating on its own. ""Half the time, I couldn't even get in the door,"" Paul complains after a bad day. If that's the case, how many times could Albert Maysles, who is credited with the photography, get in the door with him? Did the act of filming influence Paul's sales, one way or the other? Those questions aren't answered in the film, but one presumes the offscreen negotiations with the prospective customers turned the filmmakers into salesmen themselves -- and turned what they documented into a reality fiction. In the coda of ""Chronicle of a Summer,"" viewers who have just watched a cut of the film question whether the onscreen figures were acting for the camera -- and disagree about whether such put-ons are revealing or obfuscating. ""Either our characters are blamed for not being true enough,"" Morin reflects afterward, ""or they're blamed for being too true."""

After Mr. Moffett died two years ago, the building's owner approached Mr. Stulman to take over the space. It's tiny, with 34 seats inside, including the bar, and will serve breakfast and lunch for now, and eventually dinner. Jack Harris, a partner and the executive chef at Mr. Stulman's Fairfax and Bar Sardine, is in the kitchen. Like Mr. Stulman, he was inspired by Clamato, a trendy Paris bistronomie. The emphasis here will be on vegetables and seafood, and Mr. Stulman plans to offer a muffuletta sandwich at lunch. (Great Jones was known for its Cajun food.) French decorative touches abound, and the banquettes are covered in Moroccan kilim fabric.

The chef Russell Jackson's tasting-menu restaurant, which started taking reservations with prepaid tickets online a month ago, opened last week. Seats for September at the counter-service dining room are now available, and October reservations can be made starting Sept. 1. Mr. Jackson, who has an advisory panel of four people, including Dominique Crenn, the Michelin-starred chef from San Francisco, serves farm-to-table fare with a California vibe.

A year-round kiosk selling pizza and gelato across the street from the flagship Eataly in New York is the latest from the chain, which just bought out Mario Batali's minority stake in the company. A Turin specialty, pizza al padellino, a small pizza with a crust that's crunchy on the outside and soft inside, will be on offer. Topping options are margherita, with mozzarella and tomato; verdure, with ricotta and zucchini; and gricia, combining onions, guanciale and pecorino. The kiosk is decorated with cityscapes by Patrick Vale, a Brooklyn artist. Soft drinks are available now; wine, cocktails and beer will come in the fall. (Opens Friday)

On two weekends (Aug. 23 through 25 and Sept. 13 through 15), the outdoor courtyard on the West 76th Street side of the museum will serve beer, wine, soft drinks and bar snacks (cash only) from 6 to 8 p.m. A replica of George Washington's headquarters tent is set up on the lawn."

She was one of the wealthiest women of the era, but few people have ever heard her story. That's why her image is one of 13 diverse portraits recently added to a collection of paintings of the city's wealthiest trade groups. Before the additions, the Portrait Gallery of the Golden Age, as it was known, was a sea of all white and mostly male faces. It resides in a wing of the Hermitage Museum in Amsterdam that houses part of the Amsterdam Museum's collection. Among the other new portraits in the display are Elieser, a young black Jewish man who served in the household of a Spanish poet-merchant; and Sychnecta, a Native American man who was once displayed in an Amsterdam human zoo.

Ms. Schavemaker used the show's opening to announce that the Amsterdam Museum will jettison the term ""Golden Age"" for the era in the 17th century when the Netherlands was a world leader in art, science and trade, because that term tells only half the story . ""We believe that the Golden Age is, in a way, the story of the winners, and it hides the colonial past of the country,"" Ms. Schavemaker said in an interview. ""It hides slavery, but also it covers up poverty more generally. Not everyone participated in the Golden Age, not at all.""

The announcement was immediately met with widespread condemnation, and the museum's social media feeds were flooded with negative comments. Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands called the decision ""nonsense"" in a televised interview, and said he would keep using the label. Michel Rog, a member of Parliament with the Christian Democratic Appeal, said the museum's decision was ""too ridiculous for words,"" according to the newspaper De Telegraaf. But it's clear that the tide has shifted in the Dutch museum world, and that leaders of several top cultural institutions are reviewing the familiar ways of communicating history to the public, and seeking alternatives. Many curators and scholars say those institutions have to overcome a colonial mind-set .

""Decolonizing"" takes many forms. In Rotterdam, it means changing the name of a contemporary art center called Witte de With, because the Dutch naval officer whose name it bears was involved in colonial enterprises (his name, incidentally, translates to ""whiter than white""); in The Hague, it comes about through research into the man behind the name of the Mauritshuis art museum, Johan Maurits, a Dutch governor of Brazil, who initiated the slave trade there; at the Van Loon Museum, the Nieuwe Kerk and the Rijksmuseum, it manifests in exhibitions that explore colonial histories and slavery. Pieter Emmer, a professor emeritus of colonial history at Leiden University cautioned that while expanding our perspectives on other aspects of history is important, we should not ""throw out the baby with the bath water. Because that's what's happening now.""

""You need to sometimes typify a period, even if historic labels cover only a part of historical reality,"" he added. ""If you want to use terms like 'the Age of Poverty,' or 'the Age of Slavery,' or 'the Age of Disease,' that applies to all ages. That's not what makes the period stand out."" Jorgen Tjon A. Fong, the curator of the ""Dutch Masters Revisited"" display at the Hermitage, said there's good reason to get rid of vague terms that only apply to select groups of people.

""If you talk about the Golden Age, people think they know what that story is about,"" he said. ""What we forget to tell is that it was only about 1 percent of society. People in Holland were stricken by poverty, there were internal wars going on, and on top of that there was slavery as well. The people in the Netherlands today are not just descendants of that 1 percent; they're descendants of the 99 percent as well."" Using the more neutral term ""17th century,"" he added, means ""You can load it with new stories and new perspectives.""

Taco Dibbits, the director of the Rijksmuseum, said in an interview that the museum will keep using the term Golden Age, especially when it refers to 17th-century Dutch painters represented by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Frans Hals and other old masters. But, he added, the museum ""wants to give a more complete picture of history by adding other perspectives."" The museum has recently changed some of the terms it uses, removing words such as ""Negro"" and ""dwarf"" from art works and their descriptions. More significantly, the museum is addressing the less golden aspects of Dutch history by putting together the major exhibition, ""Slavery,"" set to open in September 2020. The show will center on the stories of 10 individuals, from enslaved people to boat-builders and colonial governors, who played a role in the Dutch slave trade, and part of it will be incorporated into a permanent display at the Rijksmuseum when the exhibition closes. Admiral Witte de With was an officer with the Dutch East India Company, which was a key player in the slave trade, and his narrative tells part of that story. That's why the Rotterdam art center is not only changing its name, but engaging the local community in the process, as ""part of making visible colonial legacies,"" according to Sofia Hernandez Chong Cuy, the museum's director.

The art center was named in the 1980s, she pointed out, after the street where it's located, Witte de Withstraat, so that it could become a destination in a part of the old city center that didn't have much commerce. Today it is thriving, in part because the art center turned it into a cultural hub. ""The name fulfilled its mission,"" Ms. Hernandez Chong Cuy said. ""But our larger mission is to present art and theory, and if we are true to our mission and our values now, the name creates a number of obstacles for us to achieve our goals."" The museum has invited a diverse group of young people to collaborate in the process of choosing a new name, she added, but renaming the whole institution will take time. So far, she said, the group has only renamed one exhibition space. The Mauritshuis in The Hague, home to a royal collection of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish paintings, including Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" and Carel Fabritius's ""The Goldfinch,"" became the center of a media whirlwind early this year when it temporarily removed a bust of Maurits from its display.

Emilie Gordenker, the director of the museum, who will soon take the helm of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, explained that the bust had been removed temporarily to make way for a more complex installation focused on the complex history of the man. But, she added, the controversy prompted her to develop an exhibition around Maurits that ran this summer , and to ask the museum's research team to study his personal history. Although the museum had to confront a Twitter storm, she said that, in the end, the public debate was a productive one. ""In these situations where we start talking about names -- Mauritshuis, Witte de With or Golden Age -- it can really engender a fruitful discussion about history,"" Ms. Gordenker said. ""What we have learned from this is that our mandate as a public institution is to offer as many perspectives as possible,"" she said. ""It's up to you, as a visitor, to form your own opinions. We realized that there's a very large gray area between the two poles, and that's where we want to be as a museum -- in that gray area."""

Peter Scolari plays Noonan's husband.



ALBANY -- Even some hard-core political nerds are taxed when it comes to placing the names of Erastus Corning 2nd and Dorothea (Polly) Noonan. For those of you not in the know -- and you are myriad -- Corning was the longtime Democratic mayor of Albany, ruling New York's capital city for a whopping 41 years before his death in 1983. Noonan was his closest adviser, a tough-as-nails, profane-as-church-graffiti operative who advised him on his career and other political machinations before dying in 2003, still batting away speculation that her relationship with the mayor had been more than professional. They might well have been forgotten except for a curious course of events in 2009, when Noonan's granddaughter -- Kirsten E. Gillibrand, then a little-known congresswoman from the Capital District -- was selected to fill the United States Senate seat held by Hillary Clinton, who had been named secretary of state. The sudden ascension of Ms. Gillibrand brought fresh attention to Corning and Noonan's strange personal and political relationship.

Among those taking note was Sharr White, whose new play, ""The True"" examines -- and hypothesizes about -- the affections shared between Noonan and Corning. Edie Falco and Michael McKean star in The New Group production, which opens Sept. 20 at the Pershing Square Signature Center. (Previews have begun.) The play's existence has already led to some hand-wringing in old-time Albany political circles. A late August preview in The Times Union said that ""interest and suspense is building in Albany as word spreads about the play,"" noting that it ""dares to tread upon the deeply embedded mythology"" around Corning and Noonan, both of whom were married to other people during their long stints as Democratic power brokers. Mr. White's take has the pair repeatedly denying any physical relationship beyond a stolen kiss in Pittsburgh, an event which the playwright says he made up. But Mr. White says that choice was not made out of deference to real people or their famous progeny, but rather because of the tale he wanted to tell -- about the ""ultimate party loyalist who is also the ultimate personal loyalist."" ""I didn't want to tell a salacious story,"" Mr. White, 48, said during a recent rehearsal break. ""I thought it was more interesting to tell a story about a certain kind of honor that I think these people had toward each other.""

""Those are facts, too,"" Mr. White said. ""So within those facts, you tell the story."" Mr. White began ""The True"" a few years after his breakthrough in 2011 with another drama featuring a fierce, if fragile, heroine: ""The Other Place,"" which earned a Tony nomination for Laurie Metcalf. Since then he had a second, less successful Broadway production (""The Snow Geese"") and, lately, has been a writer and producer on Showtime's ""The Affair."" As in that series, ""The True"" doesn't shy away from complicated relationships. But the play's frame is even more obscure than the characters themselves: ""The True"" is set during the back-room drama surrounding the 1977 Democratic primary for the Albany mayorship. For those of you who don't remember this contest -- again, you are not alone -- that showdown involved Corning, his political power seemingly on the wane, against Howard C. Nolan Jr., a little-known state Senator from the Hudson Valley.

 All of this is factual, though the central dramatic conflict in the play is fiction: a falling-out between Noonan and Corning, instigated by another Democratic Brahmin, who finds Noonan's demeanor off-putting and overly aggressive. Enter Ms. Falco, whose turns in ""The Sopranos"" and ""Nurse Jackie"" solidified her reputation as a leading interpreter of intelligent, no-nonsense women. Ms. Falco, herself a political junkie, said she had never heard of Corning and Noonan before reading the script, but the character of Polly grabbed her immediately. ""She reminds me a lot of the smart, driven women I grew up knowing,"" Ms. Falco said.

Yet she has steadfastly avoided doing any research on the actual Polly. ""It makes me a little bit uncomfortable,"" she said, ""because rather than going entirely on my imagination, which is kind of what I do anyway, there's this idea that someone out there may be saying, 'She would never do that,' or 'That's not the way that was.'"" Ditto for Mr. McKean, who comes to ""The True"" after a well-received Broadway turn in Lillian Hellman's ""The Little Foxes.""

""I bought a big thick book about Corning and I'm still looking at it,"" Mr. McKean said. ""It's got a great cover."" Peter Scolari, who plays Peter Noonan, Polly's accepting but not stupid husband, also said he ""gleefully"" avoided researching his character's story. Little is known about Mr. Noonan, who died in 1987, though it's clear that he was determined to avoid the nastiness that suffused his wife's world. ""He was not into politics,"" Mr. Scolari said. Same for the director, Scott Elliott, who likened studying a biography of a real-life character to studying an inanimate object. ""You can't play a mustache,"" he said. ""You have to play who you are in the character."" For Polly that will involve not a little cursing and quipping, often in the same breath.

""I'm not here to be a mourner,"" she says after the death of the famed Democratic boss Daniel O'Connell. ""There's going to be a fight for control of this party, and I'm not going to let Erastus wipe a tear if it means he can't see a left hook coming."" Bam! Unlike his leading actors, Mr. White plunged into research about Corning and his political machine, which at one point had the power to tip elections statewide and even nationally. (The Kennedy family is said to have thanked O'Connell personally for helping New York go Democratic in the 1960 presidential election.) ""People would say 'What's your new play about?' and I would say, '1977 Albany machine politics' and their eyes would cross,"" he said. Among the useful texts: a biography of Corning by the Times Union writer Paul Grondahl, as well the writings of William Kennedy, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Albany-area legend. As such the play is stocked with juicy historical tidbits on how the political machine worked, including $5 bills stuffed in residents' mailboxes on Election Day; tax increases on Republicans; and strong-arm district leaders who leaned verrrrry close to voters as they cast their ballots. Capturing Polly was more difficult, in large part because she never held elective office, and worked assiduously to stay behind the scenes.

Mr. White leaned on an interview she had done with Mr. Grondahl, as well as a public television documentary that provided the only video clip he could find of her. From that, he built the rip-roaring, sometimes heartbroken character whom Ms. Falco inhabits -- disappointed by the men around her, who both lack loyalty and misunderstand what she does. Indeed, one of the most resonant lines in the script is drawn almost verbatim from an actual Noonan quote: ""There's no machine,"" she once said, mentioning O'Connell and Corning. ""A machine doesn't have heart -- our organization did."" As a political play in hyperpartisan times, Mr. White believes that ""The True"" may have extra resonance. In 1977, Democrats were at a turning point, much as they are today, he believes. ""It's about Sanders versus Hillary,"" said Mr. White, who is a Democrat himself. ""It's about the Democratic Party challenging itself to decide where it's gone wrong, if it's gone wrong."" Such questioning is going on in New York State politics, of course, as its centrist governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, faces an insurgent challenger, the actress Cynthia Nixon, attacking from the left. (During an interview Ms. Falco and Mr. McKean both gave a plug for Ms. Nixon, a friend of both.) ""Cuomo's part of the machine just like Gillibrand is in a way,"" Mr. White said. ""They're all inheritors of it."" As for New York's junior senator, Mr. White said he would love for her to come and see his depiction of her grandmother, though that seems unlikely: Ms. Gillibrand's office declined to comment on ""The True."" The playwright said he understood the trepidation, but thought it was misplaced considering his largely affectionate take on Polly Noonan. ""This play is not about Kirsten Gillibrand in any way,"" he said. ""However, what this play is about regarding Kirsten Gillibrand is that if she was tutored by her grandmother, then you underestimate her at your peril."""
52579,"Ravenna, Italy, Glittering Still","A few miles from the Adriatic Sea, the city has arcade-lined piazzas, wine bars brimming with locals and spectacular Byzantine mosaics.","The Basilica di San Vitale, Ravenna's most visited site.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/01/travel/01RAVENNA1/01RAVENNA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=57985954a36d4e50c5cd8dde070d95379761134494630d9735dafeeb36badc68&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/travel/ravenna-italy-glittering-still.html,350404d7-beb0-53f0-9eb6-79558b5cb17a.jpg,"""Ravenna is like an island,"" said Cinzia Fabbri, a local guide I hired. ""It wasn't on an ancient Roman road, like the Via Emilia. Even today it's not on the national highway. But the remoteness saved it.""

The town enjoyed a brief heyday in the fifth century as the capital of the Western Roman Empire, protected by marshland and neighboring the powerful port of Classe. But waves of conquerors soon arrived, first Goth, then Byzantine, each leaving their mark on religious adornment. After the town fell to the Lombards in the eighth century, Ravenna drifted into economic obscurity, which inadvertently sheltered its treasure of mosaics. They remained untouched by the Renaissance and Baroque eras and even World War II, when Allied forces bombed only the train station.

Today, taking a tour of the town's oldest sites is like witnessing the turmoil of early Christianity, with its clash of Roman, Byzantine and Arian motifs. The Goth king Theodoric the Great belonged to the latter branch, which didn't accept Christ as absolutely divine; he constructed a church -- now called the Basilica di Sant'Apollinare Nuovo -- and Arian Baptistry in his devotion. The basilica's walls are covered in exquisite mosaics depicting rows of martyrs, the port of Classe and the three Magi (dressed in outfits that could have stepped off a Milan runway). The scenes gleamed lavishly with gold leaf, but Ms. Fabbri revealed another layer to the tableau: floating hands and mysteriously billowing curtains whispered of Byzantium's power, which erased the Arian faith, chipped away references to Theodoric and replaced them with mosaic drapes.

The Basilica di San Vitale, Ravenna's most visited site, offers a religious and cultural mash-up with an octagonal Roman floor plan, Byzantine architectural flourishes, glittering mosaics and remaining walls bedecked in Baroque frescoes. Built in 525 -- and allegedly the model for the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul -- the church has an interior that contrasts light and shadow, space and structure, with domes descending into columns and alabaster-paned windows maximizing the sparkle of the elaborate mosaics in the apse.

Though Ravenna is accessible by foot and easily navigated without a guide, Ms. Fabbri illuminated the monuments. At San Vitale, she pointed out mosaic birds nestled along the borders (a pair of mallard ducks, peacocks in full strut), which documented the era's wildlife. She recounted the history of the Emperor Justinian and his wife, Theodora, whose portraits face each other in a sartorial showdown, their silk robes and jewels rendered in tiny tiles set at different angles to create an illusion of depth."

57384,An Investor Adjusts His Ambitions,"Instead of going after trophy buildings in big cities, Scott Lawlor is buying up garden apartment complexes in much smaller towns, earning steady income.","Scott Lawlor at his office in Greenwich, Conn. He is returning to commercial real estate investing, this time in garden apartment buildings.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/27/business/LAWLOR/LAWLOR-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=896&w=600&s=f0035d96ecd0fbe55fc7ab7b37a8716bfaab56243f4a45eec65cbcc3e7e1dcbf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/realestate/commercial/scott-lawlor-adjusts-his-real-estate-investment-ambitions.html,314f4ec6-1408-537f-8139-50ebd02edbd4.jpg,"For many observers of the arcane world of commercial real estate investment, Scott Lawlor became a tarnished emblem for the aggressive investors who poured other people's money into major office buildings at the height of the market, driving values into the stratosphere until the bubble burst. Mr. Lawlor -- who famously acquired the John Hancock Tower in Boston in 2006 and whose lenders then sold it at a substantial loss three years later -- had his funds lose more than two-thirds of their value during the recession. Now with the real estate boom far behind him, he has quietly returned to commercial real estate investing, but instead of going after trophy buildings in big cities, he is buying up garden apartment complexes in much smaller towns. More than $3.5 billion in property deals that involved Mr. Lawlor's private equity fund, Broadway Real Estate Partners, had financing trouble during the downturn, but all those deals have since been restructured or otherwise resolved, with billions lost in the process. While Mr. Lawlor is not proud of that record, he isn't hiding from it either. But he appears to have given his investment approach an extreme makeover. Instead of prominent buildings in places like New York and Boston, he is buying residential complexes in secondary and tertiary markets like Greenville, S.C. and Maryville, Tenn.

Instead of raising a huge fund from institutions with the discretion to invest as he chooses, he now raises capital deal by individual deal from an array of deep-pocketed private investors. He has also given up on borrowing heavily and using short-term floating-rate debt to pay for at least 80 percent of a building's cost -- a strategy that got Broadway and an army of other real estate investors into trouble a few years ago. Mr. Lawlor says he now obtains long-term, fixed-rate financing for just 60 percent of an asset's total cost, including renovations. Looking back at his former approach, he said, ""I'm never going to be in that situation again. What we are doing now is very different."" His new strategy, he said, is long-term and conservative. ""It's not sexy, and there's no loss of sleep and very little risk."" His basic strategy: finding relatively small deals -- around $20 million -- in markets that larger investors are passing up, and instead of seeking spectacular returns for his backers, he aims to get them steady, reliable income over a seven- to 10-year period. Mr. Lawlor has certainly chosen his markets well. According to the Real Capital Analytics Commercial Property Price Index, apartment prices in the Southeast have been rising more slowly than in the country as a whole, and are still nearly 25 percent below average prices at the market peak; that's well off the national average for apartments of just 8 percent below peak levels.

Ronald Johnsey, the president of apartment research firm Axiometrics, said that the strategy that Mr. Lawlor's new investment vehicle, Waypoint Residential Management, has adopted was a good one. ""They are going into submarkets that appear to have been overlooked in terms of new supply,"" he said. Owners have deferred improvements to their second-tier properties in places like Greenville, S.C., as they struggled -- and often failed -- to hold on to ownership. So rents have not budged, while they have risen for top-quality buildings, said Tony Bonitati, director of the multifamily division of NAI Earle Furman in Greenville, a commercial real estate services firm. In the last quarter of 2012, according to Axiometrics, average class B rents in Greenville averaged 65 percent behind class A rents, up from a historical spread of 48 percent. A similar spread is evident in other Waypoint markets like Orlando.

These investments may look simple on the surface, but Mr. Lawlor still has an appetite for what he calls ""hairy"" situations -- deals that require some effort beyond a simple buy-and-hold strategy if the full value of the investment is to be realized. ""From time to time,"" he said, Waypoint will invest in ""special situations that are bigger and more complicated."" In the deal that represents Waypoint's largest buyout effort to date, the company acquired a 49 percent stake in a pool of four distressed apartment properties, with more than 1,100 units, across the Southeast. Although the noncontrolling stake means Waypoint still has a lot of work to do to gain ownership of what Mr. Lawlor calls ""an extraordinary investment opportunity,"" he said the deal ""gets us in the door."" Also last year, Waypoint, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., bought 198 units in a failed condo project in Orlando for $25.1 million -- half the price paid by the previous investor who undertook a condo conversion, but was foreclosed on before completion.

That buyer sold 10 percent of the units as condos before losing the property, so Waypoint now owns 90 percent of the remaining units. These are fully rented and producing income, according to a market source familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak about it, but real success will come for Waypoint if it can gain control of the condo association and eventually unite the property under one owner. In complicated transactions like these, where his investors will receive income while Waypoint pursues greater control, Mr. Lawlor believes the returns outweigh the uncertainty of when, or whether, he can unlock the properties' full value. Since 2011, Waypoint has acquired at least 2,412 apartments in 10 properties and has developed or is building 518 units in two projects. Mr. Lawlor placed the value of these assets at around $300 million, although Waypoint has invested far less than that by engaging in various partnerships, buying distressed properties and avoiding competitive auctions. To strengthen its operations, Waypoint last year acquired a multifamily property management company in Florida. The company already had some 7,000 units under management before adding Waypoint's acquisitions. Another point of departure for Mr. Lawlor is where he is finding his capital. Instead of institutions like pension funds and insurance companies, his investors are wealthy people looking for long-term income at rates higher than Treasury yields. ""There's an opportunity to fill a void in the real estate capital markets,"" he said, pointing not to investors who want to invest $1 million or $2 million, but those who might want to put $20 million or $30 million into real estate. ""That market is underserved,"" he said. Albert Zdenek, president and chief executive of Traust Sollus Wealth Management in Manhattan, said his clients appreciated both the yield and the transparency offered by vehicles like Waypoint, although he disputes that his clients are ""underserved"" in real estate choices. Still, his clients, he said, appreciate ""having an asset class with steady returns,"" especially if they can ""buy in at the bottom."" In addition, he said the opportunity to examine individual property deals beforehand is attractive. Last but not least, attractive financing from the government-sponsored agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also helps Mr. Lawlor's efforts."
39499,Animal Rights Group Says Video Shows Abuse of Sheep,"In a segment of the meat business widely considered more humane to its animals, there are accusations of mistreatment at a California plant.","Scott David, an animal rights activist, covertly shot video at a slaughterhouse while employed at a sheep farm.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/dining/02LAMB1/02LAMB1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7a9db58e3c28ad631a0a2b4efb4aee65f47ac66236d94973c38726a4e9e8be7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/dining/sheep-abuse-video.html,2b3dd0b7-0f00-52fa-a9aa-7d789294a48f.jpg,"Lamb inhabits a sleepy corner of the meat business in America, with far fewer sales than chicken, beef or pork and often raised by small producers. It is popular, however, among growing demographic groups like Latinos and Muslims, and some consumers who eat lamb because they believe the animals are raised more humanely, far from feedlots and the practices of large-scale meat production. Now an animal rights group, Compassion Over Killing, has produced a video that it says shows repeated abuse of sheep at a California processing plant owned by the nation's largest lamb producer. The approximately four-minute video was shot from May through November at a plant in Dixon, Calif., owned by Superior Farms, which sells to retail chains like Walmart and Kroger. It shows, among other things, a sheep struggling as a worker slices repeatedly at its carotid artery with a knife; some animals appear to continue breathing after their throats have been slit. In another segment, a worker from a trucking company that delivers live animals to the plant repeatedly stabs an electric prod into a truck in an apparent effort to get the sheep inside to move. The video also shows workers changing ""best by"" dates on packages of lamb.

Compassion Over Killing said the video was shot by Scott David, a supporter who worked at the plant for seven months while surreptitiously filming various aspects of its operations. The group contends that the images show violations of the federal Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, which decrees that animals must be ""rendered insensible to pain"" before they are slaughtered. ""We see a lot of ineffective stunning in the video because the animals are continuing to move after slaughter,"" said Erica Meier, the group's executive director. The video also raises questions about Superior Farms's promise that all meat from the plant is butchered according to the Islamic rules of halal, or ritual slaughter. The company said Wednesday that the video was another example of an animal rights group misconstruing normal slaughter practices, with which most people are unfamiliar. ""The video falsely alleges multiple violations"" of the slaughter law, the company said in a statement.

As for the changing of dates on packages, the company said labeling was often updated when new information was received or errors made. ""The packaging label changes shown in the video are not the result of any falsification of dates,"" it said. It said it did not allow the use of prods in its operations, and would talk to its trucking company about the electric prod seen in the video. Compassion Over Killing has sent its video to the United States Department of Agriculture, which inspects the plant and can shut it down for violations of the slaughter law. The department's Food Safety and Inspection Service ""is reviewing the video and will take appropriate action as necessary,"" Aaron Lavallee, a spokesman, wrote in an email. ""We take the safety of our food supply and the welfare of all animals seriously."" The video shows a sheep being repeatedly stunned with a hand-held electronic device, a practice Mr. David said he saw several times. ""You can see them tense up as the stunner hits them,"" he said, ""then their head droops a bit, and then they often begin to struggle again when the workers try to lay them on the slaughter line."" Lester Castro Friedlander, a former inspector for the department who volunteers with various animal rights groups, viewed the video and said it was clear that some of the animals were in pain when their throats were slashed or their tails were cut off. The Humane Method of Slaughter Act requires that if an animal is stunned before slaughter, it must be immediately rendered unconscious. ""The stunned animal shall remain in a state of surgical anesthesia through shackling, sticking and bleeding,"" the law states.

Mr. Friedlander said he believed that ""the voltage probably wasn't high enough to adequately stun the animals. And I think they know that -- otherwise, why do they have an electrical stunner right next to the place where the animal is being bled out? You don't need that if the animal is properly stunned from the beginning."" Americans eat less than a pound of lamb a year per capita, according to the Department of Agriculture. ""While more lamb is consumed each year, the increase is absorbed by the increase in population, causing consumption to be flat"" on a percentage basis, a department spokesman wrote in an email. The department's data comes only from the facilities where it has inspectors; those plants, including the California one, process about 90 percent of the more than two million sheep slaughtered for meat. They do not include state-inspected facilities or small, so-called custom slaughterhouses, which butcher animals brought to them by consumers or ranchers. Paul S. Kuber, an associate professor at Washington State University who formerly worked for Superior Farms, said a million or more sheep could be processed in such plants. He said he saw nothing in the video that violated any food safety or animal welfare laws. ""The movement you see is part of the biochemical process the muscle goes through after death,"" Professor Kuber said. ""It's a natural process -- you'll sometimes see a carcass move hours after an animal is dead.""

No federal rule governs the dating of food, although the Agriculture Department last year set out to revamp its guidance on such labels, noting that they were confusing to consumers. Currently, the ""Best if Used By,"" ""Best if Used Before,"" and ""Sell By"" dates do not indicate the safety of any product other than baby formula. In October, Mr. David was moved to the room where pelts are handled in Superior's Dixon plant. (Superior prides itself on wasting none of the animal, and its pelts are shipped to companies like the boot maker UGG.) ""That's where I first got access to film the live animals and how they're slaughtered,"" he said. Mr. David said he saw Agriculture Department inspectors at the plant. ""You'd see them in the morning looking over lambs about to be slaughtered,"" he said. ""They didn't linger in the slaughter area; they mostly just passed through it."""
2852,Surfaces? Sneezes? Sex? How the Coronavirus Can and Cannot Spread,What you need to know about how the virus is transmitted.,"The rose and yellow spheres are viral particles, which came from a coronavirus sample collected from one of the first cases in the United States.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/world/27xp-spread-pix3/27xp-spread-pix3-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html,ecd279fb-cf49-5a4a-8ce2-6515cdb3c40e.jpg,"Surfaces? Sneezes? Sex? How the Coronavirus Can and Cannot Spread

[This article is part of the developing coronavirus coverage, and may be outdated. Go here for the latest on the coronavirus.] A delicate but highly contagious virus, roughly one-900th the width of a human hair, is spreading from person to person around the world. The coronavirus, as it's known, has already infected more than 200,000 people in 140 countries. Because this virus is so new, experts' understanding of how it spreads is limited. They can, however, offer some guidance about how it does -- and does not -- seem to be transmitted. If I cross paths with a sick person, will I get sick, too? You walk into a crowded grocery store. A shopper has the coronavirus. What puts you most at risk of getting infected by that person?

Experts agree they have a great deal to learn, but four factors are likely to play some role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face. (Of course, your age and health are also major factors.) Also, the larger the number of people in the store -- or in any other situation -- the greater the chance that you'll cross paths with an infected person, which is why so many health officials are now urging people to avoid crowds and to cancel gatherings large and small.

It is a droplet containing viral particles. A virus is a tiny codependent microbe that attaches to a cell, takes over, makes more of itself and moves on to its next host. This is its ""lifestyle,"" said Gary Whittaker, a professor of virology at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. A ""naked"" virus can't go anywhere unless it's hitching a ride with a droplet of mucus or saliva, said Kin-on Kwok, a professor at the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

These mucus and saliva droplets are ejected from the mouth or the nose as we cough, sneeze, laugh, sing, breathe and talk. If they don't hit something along the way, they typically land on the floor or the ground. When the virus becomes suspended in droplets smaller than five micrometers -- known as aerosols -- it can stay suspended for about a half-hour, research suggests. To gain access to your cells, the viral droplets must enter through the eyes, the nose or the mouth. Some experts believe that sneezing and coughing are most likely the primary forms of transmission. Professor Kwok said talking face-to-face or sharing a meal with someone could pose a risk. Julian Tang, a virologist and a professor at the University of Leicester in England who is researching the coronavirus with Professor Kwok, agreed. ""If you can smell what someone had for lunch -- garlic, curry, etc. -- you are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their breath,"" he said. The virus does not linger in the air at high enough levels to be a risk to most people. But the techniques health care workers use to care for sick people can generate high levels of aerosols. This is part of why it's so important that they have proper protective equipment. How close is too close? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends keeping a distance of six feet from other people to minimize the possibility of infection. (A useful way to think about six feet is that it's roughly twice the length of the average person's extended arm.) Three feet is the distance the W.H.O. emphasizes as particularly risky when standing near a person who is coughing or sneezing.

Still, other public health experts say that at this crucial moment, when the world still has an opportunity to slow the transmission of the coronavirus, any number of feet is too close. By cutting out all but essential in-person interactions, we can help flatten the curve, they say, keeping the number of sick people to levels that medical providers can manage. How long is too long to be near an infected person? It's not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk. Will you know a person is sick? Fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath may signal that someone has been infected with the coronavirus. (Covid-19 is the name for the disease caused by the virus.) But it has become increasingly clear that people without symptoms can also infect others. In some cases, these people may later feel terrible enough to try to get tested, isolate themselves, seek treatment and notify friends and colleagues about potential risk. In still other cases, people with the virus may never experience the physical discomfort that would tip them off to the fact that they have been a danger to others.

Can the virus last on a bus pole, a touch screen or other surface? Yes. After numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, the city's Center for Health Protection collected samples from the site. Restroom faucets and the cloth covers over Buddhist texts tested positive for the coronavirus, the agency said. This coronavirus is just the latest of many similarly shaped viruses. (Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, which resemble a crown or the sun's corona.) A recent study of the novel coronavirus found that it could live for three days on plastic and steel. If you are ordering lots of supplies online, you may be relieved to know that the virus did poorly on cardboard -- it disintegrated over the course of a day. It survived for about four hours on copper.

Whether a surface looks dirty or clean is irrelevant. If an infected person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then touched that surface could pick it up. How much is required to infect a person is unclear. But as long as you wash your hands before touching your face, you should be OK, because viral droplets don't pass through skin. Also, coronaviruses are relatively easy to destroy. Using a simple disinfectant on a surface is nearly guaranteed to break the delicate envelope that surrounds the tiny microbe, rendering it harmless, Professor Whittaker said.

Can my dog or cat safely join me in quarantine? Thousands of people have already begun various types of quarantines. Some have been mandated by health officials, while others are voluntary and primarily involve staying home. Can a cat or dog join someone to make quarantine less lonely? Professor Whittaker, who has studied the spread of coronaviruses in animals and humans, said that he had seen no evidence that people who have the virus could be a danger to their pets."
20666,Trump Won't Nominate Stephen Moore for Fed Board,"Mr. Moore, a conservative commentator, appeared unlikely to win Senate confirmation after several Republican lawmakers raised concerns about his past writings denigrating women.",President Trump said he would not nominate Stephen Moore for a seat on the Federal Reserve.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/30/us/30dc-moore-promo/30dc-moore-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=37ac6607208dcab84d2bf485df78fe9fec0b656b86ca5f5b1471a0e79a95cdaa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/business/stephen-moore-fed.html,1536ebf5-acbc-5fb0-a56e-9c2b8e436182.jpg,"Stephen Moore was the second of President Trump's potential Fed picks to withdraw in recent weeks over concerns about his views and attitudes toward women.



WASHINGTON -- President Trump said on Thursday that he would not nominate Stephen Moore for a seat on the Federal Reserve board, the second time in a month that concerns over a potential nominee's treatment of women have torpedoed Mr. Trump's attempt to place a loyalist at the Fed. The withdrawal of Mr. Moore, a conservative commentator and Trump campaign economic adviser, came after Republican lawmakers criticized his past comments about women, including that they should not earn more than men, along with financial issues stemming from a 2010 divorce. Several senators relayed those concerns to the White House this week and made clear that Mr. Moore did not have the votes to clear the Republican-controlled Senate. ""I think it's probably a good thing; I think it's an important thing,"" said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who had expressed reservations about the nomination. Mr. Trump's decision to cut Mr. Moore loose appeared to come as a surprise to his potential nominee, who had spent the morning telling several news media outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, that he would not withdraw and that he retained the full backing of the White House, which was ""all in.""

This is the second time in recent weeks that one of Mr. Trump's Fed picks was forced to withdraw over concerns about his views and attitudes toward women. Herman Cain, a former pizza magnate, bowed out as he battled previous accusations of sexual harassment that ended his 2012 presidential campaign. It is unclear who -- if anyone -- Mr. Trump will formally nominate for either of the two remaining Fed seats. Among the names being floated by conservative columnists is Judy Shelton, an economist who has advised Mr. Trump and has advocated a return to the gold standard. Mr. Trump placed the decision to end the potential nomination squarely in Mr. Moore's lap, saying in a tweet early Thursday afternoon that ""Steve Moore, a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person, has decided to withdraw from the Fed process.""

In an interview with the Fox Business Network on Thursday, Mr. Moore blamed a ""sleaze campaign"" for the decision to withdraw, saying that ""if I had any sense that this would happen -- people would be looking at my writings from 20, 25 years ago -- I would have told the president, 'Wait a minute, I can't do a Senate confirmation.'"" He said some of his writings ""were insulting to women and they were meant to be a joke."" ""They were meant to be humorous and they weren't,"" he continued. In choosing Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain, Mr. Trump turned to men he considered friends and whom he saw as potential allies at the central bank, which he has criticized as an impediment to economic growth. Mr. Trump has selected four of the Fed's seven board members, including its chairman, Jerome H. Powell. But the Fed's decision last year to raise interest rates four times has angered Mr. Trump, who has urged the Fed to cut rates by one point and engage in other types of economic stimulus. Fed officials have expressed few anxieties about the two remaining vacancies, and it is not unprecedented for the board to operate without a full slate of governors. Both Janet L. Yellen and Ben Bernanke led the Fed without a full seven-member board during large parts of their tenure. Republican lawmakers urged the president to take his time before floating another name. ""Read people's articles that they write,"" said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia. That, she said, ""would be a good start."" The president selected Mr. Moore after Larry Kudlow, his National Economic Council director who was a best man at Mr. Moore's wedding, showed the president a Wall Street Journal opinion piece in which Mr. Moore called for the Fed to cut interest rates and said the central bank posed the biggest risk to the American economy. Mr. Trump told reporters he planned to nominate Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain before White House officials had performed a traditional background check, including reviewing writings, finances and past public controversies. That left his nominees to endure intense public scrutiny before being subjected to the kind of internal vetting that would typically determine whether a person could pass congressional muster.

Senate Republicans have criticized the White House for failing to consider whether a nominee could get the necessary votes before floating names and effectively scuttled the nominations of Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain before Mr. Trump could formally announce them. On Thursday, several Republican senators said that the withdrawal was a wise decision and suggested the White House learn from it. Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and a member of the Banking Committee, said that the lesson was to ""scrub or vet somebody before you even think of nominating them because they'll be scrubbed by the press, the committee and the United States people."" It was a rare instance of a critical mass of Mr. Trump's own party bucking him in the Senate. Several Republicans joined Democrats in passing bills to condemn American military action in Yemen and Mr. Trump's executive order to divert funds to build a border wall, which Mr. Trump vetoed. More recently, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, warned Mr. Trump that he would not advance a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada if Mr. Trump did not first scrap tariffs he has imposed on steel and aluminum. Mr. Moore's selection was criticized from the outset, before his financial issues and sexist comments came to light. A conservative economist and pundit, Mr. Moore built a career in Washington leaning into the culture wars and preaching the benefits of limited government, low taxes and the oil and gas industry. He founded the Club for Growth, an anti-tax political group that backed Republicans who supported low taxes -- and attacked those who did not -- in primary and general election campaigns. He has also held jobs at right-wing think tanks including the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute, and served on the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal. Democrats immediately criticized the selection of Mr. Moore as too partisan for the Fed, which is historically independent. Several prominent economists, including conservatives like N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard University, said Mr. Moore was not qualified for the position. Soon after his nomination, Mr. Moore issued what would be the first of many apologies for past statements -- in this case, expressing remorse for saying Mr. Powell should be fired after the Fed raised interest rates in December.

He apologized for some of those statements, which he called attempts at humor, and defended others. But his explanations did not appear to satisfy senators, several of whom are running for re-election in tight races. He repeatedly called the focus on his writings and finances a ""smear campaign"" and said his critics were ""pulling a Kavanaugh against me,"" a reference to the contentious nomination hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. On Tuesday, Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said she had told the White House she was unlikely to support Mr. Moore, becoming the first senator in her party to be nearing an explicit disavowal of his nomination. ""I would vote no against him, should he come up for a vote,"" Ms. Ernst told Bloomberg television on Wednesday. ""I know there are a number of other colleagues that have spoken out as well."""
29371,"Two Cities, Two Countries, Common Ground","Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales, Mexico, are sister cities with shared history. The effect of the wall between them has been profound, but connections endure.",The border wall between Arizona and Mexico.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/11/travel/11nogales2/merlin_132778532_b9714e9b-70b4-4870-a486-ab5fcd8ff5a1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c94e83e5297294be5cfbc989ffafbd337fd5f4b86cc16442c052324a29bb37c2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/travel/nogales-arizona-mexico-border.html,07c25bfa-f3e4-5a14-a95b-7f4e56f2f70c.jpg,"The border between the United States and Mexico is in the news every day, in ongoing debates about immigration and spending on security initiatives. But what is it like to visit destinations along the border? To find out, writers for Travel spent time in five pairings of places: Brownsville, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico; El Paso and Ciudad Juarez;Big Bend National Park and Boquillas; San Diego and Tijuana; and Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales across the border in Mexico. ""Please don't write another story about drugs,"" Sigrid Maitrejean, a volunteer guide at the Pimeria Alta Museum inside the old city hall in Nogales, Ariz., beseeched me in a playful tone. It was not the only time during my three-day visit to the region that people would make a similar plea: enough of the endless media stories and political rhetoric about the supposedly dangerous United States-Mexico border, which only serve to keep visitors away. Residents of this town of 20,000 souls wanted me to see the Nogales they see: a place steeped in layers of rich history and culture, which maintains a uniquely special relationship with its namesake and sister city across the border, Nogales, Sonora. And indeed, in the two Nogaleses -- or Ambos Nogales, as locals refer to them -- I found the most quintessential of all the border cities.

The descendant of families that were already living in the Texas border region when the international boundary was drawn up in 1848, I grew up almost in two countries, spending Sundays across the border immersed in the Mexican universe of my abuelitos and tias and primos. We didn't talk about it like we were visiting another country -- we went to el otro lado, the other side. I liked that my sisters and I could choose what we loved about each of our two upbringings, and creatively mix languages and systems of meaning. There are 16 sets of sister cities that line the 1,950-mile United States-Mexico border, and as a journalist who has focused on the region, I've experienced all but two of them. While I'd been in Nogales before to report on immigration and the border wall, what I learned on this visit is that calling Ambos Nogales ""one town in two countries"" may be a slight exaggeration, but it's a very apt metaphor. And this is what makes it a fascinating place to visit.

The land was not part of the original territory gained by the Americans at the end of the Mexican War, but the United States government acquired it in 1853, through the Gadsden Purchase, to build the southern transcontinental railway line. Foreseeing the boon in international commerce that intersecting railroads could bring, two Russian brothers named Jacob and Isaac Isaacson set up a trading post in 1880, which was renamed Nogales by the U.S. Postal Service soon thereafter. To support the new trade, a community emerged on the Mexican side of the line that people also referred to as Nogales. Unlike the Texas border, however, where the boundary is defined by the Rio Grande, Arizona's is a land border, and in Nogales, the border was an unobstructed street called International, half of which technically lay in one country, half in another. Around it, a seemingly singular town spread north and south. But managing an international division, it turned out, wasn't simple. The first fence on the United States-Mexico border went up here -- after the Mexican government called for it.

The United States government had grown wary after the Mexican Revolution began in 1910, and relations had tensed as each side accused the other of banditry and incursions. The United States set up a military camp in Nogales, Ariz., and General John J. Pershing was dispatched to chase after the Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa. The Sonora governor put up an 11-wire fence, which got torn down four months later. In 1918, after the two cities went to war for a day because an American guard shot a Mexican citizen at the border crossing, authorities on both sides agreed to construct a permanent chain-link fence between them. But as life resumed, the fence became a technicality, not a reflection of how people related across the line. During Prohibition, Mexicans built saloons that straddled the border, so that patrons could drink so long as they were on the correct side of the building.

Ms. Maitrejean remembers how this tight-knit existence endured as she was growing up. In the 1950s, a Mexican shop on International Street would put up a huge blackboard to transmit the World Series as nogalenses watched the games excitedly from the United States side. On Cinco de Mayo, city leaders would build a platform over the fence and crowned a binational queen as a joint parade marched across the border. Eventually, migration from other parts of Mexico grew through the area, and stricter United States enforcement followed. ""The border crossing was getting more difficult,"" said Ms. Maitrejean, ""and, of course, once they put up our horrible Vietnam landing-mat fence in the '90s, that was really the end."" Made of 10-foot panels of corrugated steel that the United States Army had used to land helicopters in the Vietnam War, that was the fence that locals most resented, for it blocked the view they had always had to the other side. Then in 2011, the federal government replaced it with a rust-colored steel bollard fence, encased in cement footing with four-inch slats between the bars. Now, the two Nogaleses could see each other again, somewhat. Soon, families that didn't have the right paperwork to cross started coming to either side on weekends to catch up with each other across the bollards.

Today, Jessy Zamorano, the owner and operator of Baja Arizona Tours, is struck by how her clients, many of whom are from the northeast or Midwest, react when she takes them to the fence. ""Women are very much more sympathetic,"" she said. ""They will look at it, and some find it quite shocking and obtuse. But many of the men say, 'build it higher.'"" When they spot some of the families reaching between steel bars to hug each other, or holding up a newborn baby for their relatives on the other side to meet, she said, ""women will frequently cry."" Driving south the 60 miles from Tucson, where the closest commercial airport is, the highway rises thousands of feet as the desert scrublands of the lower Sonoran desert give way to hilly terrain ringed by the Santa Rita, San Cayetano and Tumacacori mountains.

Almost everything is bilingual and international. Twice, I assumed that individuals with fair skin and Anglo last names were white, only to learn they had at least one Mexican parent. I met Mexicans who had dual citizenship and owned homes on both sides of the border, and white residents who spoke excellent Spanish. The Paul Bond Boots shop that has made the traditional custom boots of classic Western films is staffed by Mexican craftsmen. ""I sit here every day and I marvel at it. I totally do,"" said Nils Urman, the executive director of the Nogales Community Development Corporation. A native of Germany, he married into a local family in the late 1970s. ""I think it's the most fascinating thing I've seen in my life, and I've been here 38 years."" And there's more diversity in the city than American and Mexican, he said. ""This community's got French, it's got Irish in it, it's got Greek in it, and they're on both sides of the border.""

One painting, which makes a haunting image at night when the streetlights reflect the wall's bars onto the street below it, simply shows the boyish face of a teenage boy. It memorializes Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, a 16-year-old who authorities say in 2012 was throwing rocks to distract Border Patrol agents as two males tried to drop back down to the Mexican side of fence after smuggling bundles of marijuana. One of the agents shot through the fence and killed the young man on Mexican land. The border and its themes naturally infuse some of the artistic production of Nogales, Sonora, because of the way it shapes the artists' daily lives, said Elena Vega, a local poet and photographer who also experiments through painting, dance, music and spoken word. ""In the art world, it's always like that -- some people live over there and come play here, or else we go and present our work over there,"" she said. ""So, it's a coming-and-going. Maybe my work has that essence, but it's not that I'm looking for it. It happens, it emerges from the work."" While Mexico, like the United States, sometimes looks down upon its border cities, Ms. Vega said it is creative precisely because it's a fluid, heavily traversed zone. ""I think it's the border environment. There's more openness, it's more diverse."" Even as downtown Nogales, Sonora, also struggles to remain vibrant with fewer Americans crossing over, the rest of the city is thriving, seemingly growing by the day and producing not just art, but a new gastronomic culture, said Alex La Pierre, the program director for the Border Community Alliance. The alliance, which works with organizations in both countries to increase social investment and improve Americans' understanding of the border, offers tours for Americans who prefer to visit with a guide. One of the tours introduces them to nonprofits including a migrant shelter. Another takes them to a craft brewery and to Calle Hermosillo, a long street that is home to many new restaurants and bars. ""Sonora, in addition to having the best beef in all of Mexico,"" Mr. La Pierre said, ""also has some of the best seafood in Mexico, because they're adjacent to the Gulf of California, which Jacques Cousteau called 'the aquarium of the world.' What I tell our guests is that Sonora really has the best of surf and turf.""

On a warm Saturday in early January, as I walked the downtown zone, averting my eyes to avoid the many vendors who will immediately try to pull you into their curio shops, I felt the energy change immediately. Mexican border cities are always a little busier and more alive than their American counterparts. Cars backed out of parking spots from every direction, and people moved briskly along the sidewalks. Amid endless pharmacies and dental offices catering to mostly-gone Americans, local life pulsed and thrived. As I turned a corner and made my way toward Calle Internacional, the street that once singularly marked the border, to view the wall art, I glimpsed a young woman on the American side of the fence who was reaching through it as she lovingly stroked the head of a teenage boy squatting on the other side. And I remembered Jessy Zamorano's comment about tourists reacting when they witness these displays of humanity. It seems something fantastic happens when you draw a line on the ground: People almost instinctively reach out across it toward each other. And that's a hard thing to appreciate from anywhere else but the border."

MUNCIE, Ind. -- Lexi Vann was losing her race with Bob Ross. The 19-year-old from Carmel, Ind., sporting a bushy brown Bob wig that defied the stiff Halloween afternoon breeze, dipped her brush into a pool of purple paint and began tracing the outline of a mountain range, taking her cue from an episode of ""The Joy of Painting"" on a screen set up on the lawn. But Ross, whose curly perm and soothing voice were at odds with his breakneck pace, finished his work, titled ""Sunset Aglow,"" five minutes ahead of her. ""As soon as he started going with the trees, I was lost,"" Ms. Vann said, her cheeks flushed. She was among the more than 100 fans of the PBS painter who made the trek -- in her case 50 miles, but others came from as far away as Arizona -- for the sold-out opening day of the ""Bob Ross Experience,"" a $1.2 million permanent exhibit and painting workshop series in the city where the beloved television host filmed his show from 1983 to 1994, and inspired generations of fans with his yes-you-can positivity.

""This is fantastic,"" Brett Estes, the Best Bob winner said, outfitted in a Bob wig (from a costume shop), beard (real) and light blue button-down. His brushes were tucked in the front pocket. But the crown jewel awaited fans inside Ross's studio, the former public television station WIPB, inside the Lucius L. Ball House (the family gave the country the iconic glass kitchen jar). Fifteen masked visitors per hour, with timed tickets, could pose with Ross's easel, palette and the set of brushes he used to create what he called his ""happy little trees."" ""We made it as close as possible to how it appeared when he filmed here"" while still accommodating visitors, George Buss, the vice president of visitor experience at Minnetrista, said.

Ross lovers can slip on a vintage J.C. Penney shirt like the ones he wore on the show, or flip through a stack of his fan mail. And they can pore over shelves full of Ross essentials like a jar of Vicks VapoRub, which he used to clear his sinuses to ensure a smooth, velvety voice, and the hair pick he kept in his back pocket to fluff out his perm. But the ultimate Ross Zen awaits fans in the far corner of the studio, where a painting of a misty mountain rests on an easel, one of some 30,000 (including copies) that the artist boasted of producing in a 1991 interview with The New York Times. (Ross died in 1995, at age 52, of complications from lymphoma; his works -- if you can find one -- have been offered for up to $55,000 on eBay.) An episode of ""The Joy of Painting"" plays on the camera monitor -- and visitors who step in front of the easel will find themselves standing in Ross's shoes. The experience can be overwhelming, leaving some visitors in tears.

They can also step across the hall into a re-creation of a 1980s American living room, its shelves filled with such memorabilia as a Bob Ross Chia Pet and a Bob Ross toaster. ""We wanted to also show Bob as fans watching at home in their living room knew him,"" Mr. Buss said. In another building half a mile up the boulevard, a dozen masked people hunched over socially distanced canvases, trying their hand at ""Gray Mountain,"" in a master class led by Jeremy Rogers, a 21-year-old Ross instructor. (The four workshops offered this weekend were capped at 12 people per class, but Minnetrista plans to offer the three-hour sessions twice a month going forward, for $70 per person.) Mr. Rogers has been certified since 2018 -- one of at least 5,000 instructors to complete a three-week training course at the Bob Ross Art Workshop and Gallery in Florida. It offers certification in landscape, floral and wildlife painting and requires that students complete approximately two paintings per day. ""It's pretty intense,"" he said, adding that it was the speed demanded of instructors that he found most challenging. Ross completed each painting live on air, with no breaks or cutaways, in 26 minutes and 47 seconds. ""To do it as fast as him --"" Rogers paused and shook his head. ""Man."" He said it takes him about an hour to complete a painting. Doug Hallgren, who has been certified since 2003, managed to match Ross stroke for stroke in a demonstration Saturday on the lawn. The trick, he said, is to embrace ""happy little accidents"" as Ross called them. ""It's about learning not to go back,"" Mr. Hallgren said. ""No matter how much you might want to.""

Jessica Jenkins, the vice president of collections and storytelling at Minnetrista, said that while critics saddle Ross with a reputation for kitsch, she's thrilled to finally see him getting the recognition he deserves. The Smithsonian Museum of American History acquired four Bob Ross paintings and a selection of memorabilia last year, and while the museum has not announced its time frame for exhibiting them, the Bob Ross Experience currently displays six of the 26 paintings in the Minnetrista collection. ""Lots of people don't view Bob as a real artist, which is upsetting because he made it simple on purpose for TV,"" Ms. Jenkins said. She walked over to a Ross seascape -- a gift from Ross's widow -- on the wall in the Ball home. ""This is vastly more than what he did on television,"" she said. ""These are the ones he took his time on; the ones he did for him."" Also on view is an exhibit of 29 Bob Ross paintings that have never been publicly displayed in Oakhurst, a historic Ball home nearby. A majority are loans from Muncie residents, who tell how they acquired the paintings from Ross's demonstrations in local malls, or as gifts from the painter himself.

Ms. Jenkins acknowledges that the middle of a pandemic may seem like a strange time to kick off an interactive exhibition like this one, but she says everyone could use a dose of Ross's calm and positivity right now. ""My biggest fear in getting into this project was that I'd find out he wasn't the person I thought he was,"" Ms. Jenkins said. ""But the Bob Ross you see on TV is completely sincere. He put everyone else first constantly. I was like, 'Oh, thank God, he was not a jerk.'"""
23776,What's Left After a Family Business Is Sold?,"After so much attention to running things, little thought goes into what comes next. Relatives should focus on their values, not money, advisers say.","Before the sale of his family's company, William Deary had been formulating a plan with his wife and daughter for their wealth that focused on family values but also held the family members accountable.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/09/business/09WEALTH-01/09WEALTH-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a0ea1587e2bb58e747ab671cde272f0eb3b6c5ef72e9cb8ce7c3c4be2a60481a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/your-money/whats-left-after-a-family-business-is-sold.html,112161a5-1afe-5448-a349-a39976431586.jpg,"Four years after the sale of his family's business, Malt-O-Meal, John Brooks said he still felt a void in his life. His grandfather had started the cereal maker in 1919, and his father ran it until his death in 1988. Nonfamily executives expanded it into the fourth-largest cereal producer in the United States before Post Cereal bought it for $1.15 billion in 2015. Since the sale, the three branches of the family have gone their own ways, Mr. Brooks said. They are no longer bound by a company or annual meetings or feel the pride of going through the cereal plants around Minneapolis. The relatives are managing their share of the proceeds on their own. It's not as satisfying, Mr. Brooks said. He wishes the family still owned the company. ""It was a fascinating challenge to have a business with great products, a great board and great employees up there really hustling to grow the business,"" he said. ""I have an M.B.A. in finance, so I was prepared to manage the money. But it's just not as interesting.""

Having a pile of money in place of a company, with all of its stress and complications, would seem like a relief. But a company often holds families together by giving members a shared identity and conferring a status in the community established by previous generations. Without the company, the family's perception of itself and its purpose can change, and it is often something that members are not prepared for. Their focus was on running the business and then on the sale; little thought went into what comes next. ""This is going to become more and more relevant because of the aging out of baby boomers,"" said Michael Cole , chief executive of Cresset, which manages money for large wealthy families. ""The key to doing it successfully is how you prepare yourself and how you prepare your family. It's really a lifestyle choice."" If families do not do it right, splitting apart is almost inevitable. ""A shared business becomes very much a glue,"" Mr. Cole said. ""When the business is sold, what we see in almost every situation is some family member splits away."" Mergers and acquisitions involving family businesses are already happening at an increasing clip , said Rick Simonetti , head of wealth planning for Abbot Downing , a division of Wells Fargo. Owners are putting their businesses on the block or receiving unsolicited offers, often for more than what the families thought their company was worth, he said, citing an increase in referrals from bankers working to sell family businesses.

Most advisers say the sale of a family business should focus on the transition from operating a company to managing a portfolio of money, not on the money itself. Sometimes the magnitude of the sale becomes an issue for a family's identity, particularly if the acquisition price becomes public. This happened to Sabrina Merage Naim when her father and uncle sold Chef America, the maker of Hot Pockets. Nestle bought it in 2002 for $2.6 billion in cash when she was still in high school. The two brothers owned the entire company. ""Hot Pockets were well known and famous then, but I wasn't prepared for the financial aspect of it,"" she said. ""Once the business sold and I went to school, people saw what that business sold for, and my friends said, 'Oh my, you guys have money.'"" Ms. Naim credits her parents with talking about hard work and not money when she was growing up. It did not hurt that her father rolled his money into a family investment office that he operated as a business, not a passive investment vehicle that funded the family's lifestyle. She now runs Echo Capital Group, which uses the family's experience in packaged food to invest in smaller food companies. But some families focus more on the money than the traits that made the business successful, and fail to grasp the difference between an operating business and financial capital. Even if the proceeds from a sale are invested prudently, Mr. Simonetti said, returns will hit a ceiling.

""You're not going to earn double digits across a portfolio the way you could with owning a business,"" he said. Mr. Brooks was one of 10 family members who owned the majority of Malt-O-Meal. He said he expected his children to withdraw no more than 1 percent a year of his share -- still a large amount of money -- so that the assets could continue to grow the way his family's business did. But advisers say this strategy can be problematic for future generations. ""It's really hard to have one generation exert these from-the-grave controls that will govern possibly unborn generations to come,"" said Covie Edwards-Pitt , chief wealth strategist at Ballentine Partners. ""It's somewhat impractical."" An approach like this, she said, also misses the importance of talking about family values. ""People tend to think the answer is in the money when usually it's not,"" she said. But agreeing on family values takes time. William Deary , who quit his job in publishing to help his wife, Cherilyn, start a home health care company, said they had made sure that their child, Kylyn, saw what they were doing. Over 23 years, the family created Great Lakes Caring Home Health and Hospice, a company with more than 9,000 employees around the Midwest. Mr. Deary said his family received three private equity investments over a decade, allowing them to diversify their wealth gradually by the time they ceded control of the company in 2017. But years before the sale, the family had been formulating a plan for its wealth that focused on family values but also held the members accountable. A family scorecard, for example, tracks their progress on 40 items that the family has deemed important, including working hard, investing wisely and the protecting its legacy.

Mr. Deary said the family used the scorecard to objectively answer the question: ""Are we constantly trying to get a little bit better every day at what we do?"" As the wealth stretches out and families grow, those values can become a substitute for the company. David J. Herritt , head of family office services at GenSpring, a unit of SunTrust Private Wealth Management, said continuing education about the family's values, particularly when the company was gone, allowed successive generations to understand where their wealth came from. Those values often work best when they are broad -- honesty, integrity, hard work -- and not so specific that family members chafe. ""The loose binds bind best,"" Mr. Herritt said. Family relationships can suffer when there are no shared values but strong financial connections, like a large trust or partnership that manages the wealth. ""If the relationships fall out but they're still connected financially, that opens the door to litigation,"" said Amy Castoro , president and chief executive of the Williams Group, which counsels families. ""Things can really go off the rails then."" Sometimes, Ms. Castoro said, it is better to let members of the family go their own ways. ""There's this romantic notion that we all get together for Thanksgiving,"" she said. ""Maybe family members only want to get together once a year, or interact through the family office. That's O.K., but make it explicit.""

Mr. Brooks said he saw his sisters, who live in the Minneapolis area, but was focused on having family meetings with his children and their spouses. ""I'm doing what my father did back in the early '80s,"" he said. ""We're talking about money. As owners, we worked hard to be an effective ownership group. Now, we need to be an effective management group. We have to manage the money."""
18752,Airbnb and Miami Beach Are at War. Travelers Are Caught in the Crossfire.,"The Florida city, like others around the country, is trying to control the home sharing market. Renters often find out their weekend home is illegal when they get a knock on the door.","On a recent weekend, six of 1330 15th Street&rsquo;s eight units were occupied by short-term renters.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/17/travel/13Miamibeach-airbnb6/13Miamibeach-airbnb6-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=685032b80c8055e98a2e10a7c28de82a699165edc263ab0128c15faba22ec5f1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/travel/airbnb-miami-beach-war.html,97a58e0d-7591-59ad-9e6e-d97da1296e36.jpg,"Short-term rentals are illegal in the Flamingo Park neighborhood of Miami Beach, but lockboxes where tenants can pick up keys are a common sight.





Airbnb and Miami Beach Are at War. Travelers Are Caught in the Crossfire .

On a recent Friday evening, David Igbokwe and his friends were relaxing in their Miami Beach Airbnb, listening to music and getting ready to go out to dinner. Their plans were interrupted by a knock at the door. ""City of Miami Beach,"" said Jackie Caicedo, a code compliance officer who works for the city. Mr. Igbokwe opened the door and began answering questions: Was he from Miami Beach? Did he find the apartment on Airbnb? Ms. Caicedo had some bad news. ""I'm here because, basically, this is an illegal short-term rental,"" she said. ""It's in a residential area. It's zoned in a residential area, so it's prohibited for anyone to rent a unit for less than six months and a day.""

That same night, within a 45-minute period, Ms. Caicedo knocked on the doors of five other apartments in the building at 1300 15th Street, a two-story, eight-unit white structure. Apt. 101 had two older men who wouldn't reveal their plans. In Apt. 103, two men in their 20s were visiting from New York City for the weekend. Apt. 104 had an Argentine family of four. Apt. 201 had an older Chilean couple on vacation for the week. In Apt. 204, a young man and woman were visiting from the nearby town of Hallandale, Fla. All of the apartments had been illegally rented out. The property manager of an apartment building next door had called in a complaint. Typically, when the city's code compliance officers come across illegal short-term rentals, they ask renters to contact their hosts and ask to be relocated. In situations where the hosts won't cooperate, guests still have to leave. On occasion, the city helps them find a new place to stay. But since Mr. Igbokwe and his friends were cooperative and leaving after just two nights, Ms. Caicedo said she would recommend that they be allowed to stay in the apartment.

""We have residential areas in our community and we have zoned them so when people purchase a home they know they are in a residential community,"" said Mayor Dan Gelber of Miami Beach, saying that Airbnb was knowingly flouting the law. Airbnb, for its part, is currently suing the city, saying that its regulations are overly burdensome. ""Nobody benefits when cities impose laws written with the sole intent of punishing both residents and consumers,"" wrote Benjamin Breit, a spokesman for the company, in an email. In the increasingly heated war between the rental companies and communities, renters like Mr. Igbokwe and his friends, who unwittingly book rooms that are being offered illegally, are the collateral damage. They can end up out on the street, out hundreds of dollars and in need of a new place to stay, sometimes in the middle of the night. ""We 100 percent would have rented elsewhere if we'd known we couldn't stay there,"" Mr. Igbokwe said. ""The whole thing was out of our hands, which is frustrating."" It's easy to understand why tourists want to stay in Flamingo Park. It's close to the beach. It's surrounded by popular restaurants. As one tourist who didn't want to be named because she was staying in an illegal rental said while rolling her bag down the street, Flamingo Park is ""postcard perfect.""

Increasingly, residents have filed noise complaints with the city, which brings out officers like Ms. Caicedo, who night after night knock on doors and tell renters that they're breaking the law. The code compliance department said that noise complaints are one way it finds out about illegal rentals. ""Young people often want to continue the party after they've left an actual party,"" Ms. Caicedo said. ""Usually we only find out it's a short-term rental after we go to a place for another complaint like noise."" The department said it conducted 1,737 short-term rental investigations in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, up from 592 in 2013-2014; for the last two years any interactions have been captured on the body cameras code compliance officers wear when they're on duty. Residents say they also have to deal with the trash left behind by renters. ""If these were mom-and-pop operations, with people renting out a room here and there, we wouldn't all notice,"" said Jeff Donnelly, who has lived in Flamingo Park with his wife since 1992. ""We notice because these are inns without innkeeping, and the innkeeping falls on the neighbors."" Mr. Donnelly and Ms. Smarsh also said the short-term rentals are taking away long-term rentals for people who work in Miami's hotels and restaurants. Ms. Smarsh said she and her neighbors were not motivated by renters' color or ethnic origins. ""We have neighbors from all over South America, from Europe and around this country, and we want them here,"" Ms. Smarsh said. ""We want to see appreciation, development, growth, diversity, but it's still a neighborhood.""

Natalie Nichols, a longtime Miami Beach resident, is one of the rare former Airbnb hosts willing to be interviewed. She is currently suing the city over the steep fines Miami Beach imposes on homeowners. Ms. Nichols said she began renting out space in her own home as well as in another building that she has owned since 2006. But it wasn't until the financial crisis in 2008 that she depended on rentals for income. That year, she said, ""I was laid off of a pharmaceutical sales job I had for 14 years. Long-term tenants of mine quit paying rent and broke leases."" Renting out her properties short term allowed her to make money and avoid foreclosure, she said, as well as to pay taxes, mortgage and insurance. But complaints about short-term rentals grew and the city increasingly cracked down. Owners caught renting illegally are fined $20,000 the first time they are caught, with the fine going up in $20,000 increments for every subsequent time they are caught. On a second violation there can be an added $25,000 enhanced fine if the home is 5,000 square feet or larger. A $20,000 fine was enough for Ms. Nichols, who said she sold one home and is living in the other without the income to sustain it. ""I am depleting my retirement savings, and the city has taken a business from me that should have produced income and carried me through retirement,"" she said. In December, Merk Aveli, an artist from Boston, traveled to Miami Beach for Art Basel. He reserved a shared room on Airbnb for a weekend but because of car trouble needed to extend his stay, which his host, a woman named Dina, welcomed. While Dina was out one morning, code compliance officers knocked on the door and told Mr. Aveli the rental was illegal and he had to leave. Dina returned to the house and tried to advise Mr. Aveli on what to say if the officers returned to ensure he'd left. ""The lady wanted me to tell housing I was her boyfriend,"" Mr. Aveli said. ""I did not. Instead I showed them my receipt and was sent from the spot.""

Had he known it was illegally listed, Mr. Aveli said, he would not have booked the room. ""Why was it even an option?"" he asked. ""It's not right."" Mr. Aveli ended up crashing on a friend's couch for the remainder of his stay. Knowing that the rental had been illegal and upset about the experience, he tried to get a refund for the two nights he had stayed at the apartment. ""I contacted Airbnb and they refused to refund me,"" he said. Mr. Aveli said he didn't bother trying to get a refund from Dina directly because he was frustrated. Mr. Breit would not comment on Mr. Aveli's situation, but said the company wanted to ""partner with Miami Beach to develop sensible and enforceable home-sharing regulations, which would help protect guests to the City against unfortunate incidents like this."" The apartment and the host are no longer listed on Airbnb. Even if that rental is no longer available, walking around Flamingo Park at midday, it's clear that many other homes are: every few blocks there is a van parked on the street with its doors wide open. Inside are towels and bedding that smell freshly cleaned. When asked if the linens are for hotels, a man laughed and said, ""You a reporter? I can't talk to you, but lots of Airbnbs around here. Good for business."""

Saudi Arabia at the Crossroads

By David H. Rundell

BLOOD AND OIL

Mohammed bin Salman's Ruthless Quest for Global Power

By Bradley Hope and Justin Scheck One of my most embarrassing moments in government came in 1995. I was a young staffer at the National Security Council, and a terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia suggested growing unrest there. At an interagency meeting on the subject, I turned to the representative from United States Central Command and asked when was the last time they had updated their contingency plan for internal conflict in the kingdom. It struck me as the right question to ask, the kind of thing that the N.S.C. was supposed to ask. It would have been unforgivable not to have asked it. But all of the older, wiser folks at the table looked at me as if I had just said to the general: ""I'm going to douse myself with gasoline and strike a match. Would you like to join me?""

Afterward, another graybeard pulled me aside and explained, impatiently: ""We don't have contingency plans for that. It would be like trying to make contingency plans for the Earth colliding with the sun."" Fast-forward a decade and I was having dinner with my friend Gideon Rose at a Chinese restaurant on Second Avenue in New York. Gideon is the editor of Foreign Affairs magazine and was among the first to recognize the impact of the shale oil revolution on America's interests in the Middle East. He argued that fracking would soon render the Middle East strategically irrelevant. My response was that it someday might, but first it would drive down the price of oil and with it, the stability of all the sclerotic Middle Eastern states that had bought off their populations with sinecures and subsidies for so long. The key question was whether the eventual state collapses would come before or after the point when the world could live without Middle Eastern oil. That, in a nutshell, is our problem with Saudi Arabia. Fracking has knocked the legs out of the international oil market and helped make the tired old political-economic systems of the Muslim Middle East unsustainable. As the 2009 Green Movement in Iran and 2011 Arab Spring both illustrated, this is stirring the pot of revolution, civil war and other forms of internal upheaval all across the region. Virtually all of the states of the Middle East face a choice between reform or revolution, although many insist on clinging to repression instead. Unfortunately, revolution and civil war have proved the greatest threats to oil production.

And the world is not yet ready to live without the unmatched reserves, enormous production and unique spare capacity of Saudi Arabia. All of the fracking in the world could not compensate for the loss of Saudi oil. Which is why Riyadh's current course under King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman (M.B.S.), is so important to the United States. The dramatic transformation that M.B.S. is trying to bring about is exactly the right answer for the kingdom and what the United States needs to have happen there. Yet Saudi Arabia is a difficult ally. It is too important to be cast aside, but too different to fit easily with American values. And as readers of this newspaper know well, M.B.S. is a brash young autocrat who makes as many outrageous missteps as laudatory moves. He is as determined to reinforce the kingdom's authoritarian politics as he is to modernize its economy and liberalize its culture. Thus, we are fortunate to have a new book on Saudi Arabia as helpful as David H. Rundell's ""Vision or Mirage: Saudi Arabia at the Crossroads."" If you don't know the author's name, don't worry. It's because he is a longtime American civil servant who lived in Saudi Arabia for 16 of his 30 years with the Foreign Service, and has traveled the length and breadth of the land. Rundell covers the kingdom from top to bottom with vast wisdom, depth and understanding. Yet it would be unfair to call his book a primer because that suggests a superficiality that is entirely at odds with the vast learning encompassed in this slim volume. His book is not just the ABCs of Saudi Arabia; it is the DEFGs and Hs too. It provides a superb overview of the kingdom's political, economic and social landscape, but it goes well beyond that. Rundell explains, clearly and concisely, the special dynamics that drive the kingdom and render it so alien from our own society. In so doing, Rundell illustrates why Saudis react to events so differently from Americans and how dangerous the American penchant for mirror-imaging is when applied to them. I wish that every United States diplomat, military officer and journalist would read this book before deploying there. I wish that every member of Congress would read it before voting on any measure related to Saudi Arabia. I wish every American pondering the frictions of our long relationship with the Saudis would read it simply to understand.

Bradley Hope and Justin Scheck, investigative reporters for The Wall Street Journal, approach the topic differently in ""Blood and Oil: Mohammed bin Salman's Ruthless Quest for Global Power."" For a certain kind of reader, this book will be ideal. It is lively and well written, and it draws a sharp portrait of the man at its heart. But be forewarned that this is a book on an engrossing but narrow topic: M.B.S.'s lust for wealth and how it has been bound up with his drive for power. On that subject, Hope and Scheck have done a great deal of digging and have unearthed some eye-popping tales. Many of the stories are not sourced, however. They often appear plausible but it's impossible to be sure. And as F. Gregory Gause, one of the leading Western academic experts on Saudi Arabia, likes to say, when it comes to the royal family, those who know don't talk, and those who talk don't know. Of greater consequence, because of this focus, geostrategic and geoeconomic factors often get short shrift in their telling. Thus, they have an entire chapter on M.B.S. buying a Leonardo da Vinci painting for $450 million but only a few pages on the decision to intervene in Yemen, arguably Riyadh's most important (and damaging) strategic gambit of the past 30 years. At times, they assert a narrative consistent with their emphasis on the foibles of M.B.S. at the expense of these other dynamics. So the 2020 oil war with Russia, in which Riyadh flooded the market to try to force Moscow to agree to collective production limits, gets reduced to a byproduct of M.B.S.'s overweening pride. Whatever role ego may have played in it, this version overlooks the facts that the price of oil was plummeting, and the Saudis and other producers desperately needed to stabilize it, but Russia refused to do so. Moreover, the Saudi decision to flood the market and drive the price down below $20 per barrel worked. It forced Moscow to agree to production cuts and so was a huge victory for Riyadh. Every alliance is difficult. Even Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt got frustrated with each other -- let alone with Stalin and de Gaulle."
34387,Roger Federer Wants to Win a New Game,"By teaming with Uniqlo, a brand focused on basics with mass appeal, the tennis star is gearing up to play in a different kind of public court.",Roger Federer wearing Uniqlo at the 2018 Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/autossell/12UNBUTTONED1/12UNBUTTONED1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=196b75a43c3b55671d93f00f7e7aee4ae7f28198c5d3a1852856361442353550&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/style/roger-federer-uniqlo-nike.html,fa62ab23-26c4-58df-996b-d40a599b9490.jpg,"It's not often that any tennis player can manage to upstage Serena Williams when it comes to fashion, but at Wimbledon Roger Federer did just that, provoking the kind of social media meltdown that is usually reserved for a cat suit on the court. The reverberations of his decision to trade his Nike swoosh for a Uniqlo red square reached all the way to the gilded rooms of the Paris couture, where I was when it happened. Ever since, as Mr. Federer has progressed through the tournament with his signature efficient grace, and eyes have adjusted to the new look, much has been written about the money involved ($300 million, reportedly); the length of the contract (10 years, ditto); and the other potential reasons for the change after more than two decades. (Mr. Federer will be the only big star on the Uniqlo roster, whereas at Nike he was one among many, including Ms. Williams and Rafael Nadal; Uniqlo needs him to boost its international expansion efforts.) But as the grass has settled on center court, I have not been able to stop wondering about the real impact of this decision on the sports/fashion nexus -- a synergistic relationship fast approaching the status and revenues of the Hollywood/fashion nexus.

Because in choosing Uniqlo, Mr. Federer is effectively creating a new paradigm for a post-technical sports brand adventure. Could he become the Jessica Simpson of men's wear? Don't laugh. Ms. Simpson is the most successful celebrity-with-an-accessible-fashion-line. It's not a bad model to follow. Certainly, the length of the Uniqlo contract, which will take Mr. Federer well into his mid-40s, would suggest that he is thinking along such after-tennis lines. As would the fact that Uniqlo identifies itself in a somewhat different category than the usual brands that sponsor athletes. The news release even laid it out: ""Uniqlo enters the partnership inspired by the past accomplishments of Mr. Federer and his previous partners,"" it read. But then: ""While respectful of new standards they set together, Uniqlo is not a sports company. Uniqlo describes itself as a life company that creates LifeWear."" Which may sound like a fancy synonym for ""clothes"" but reflects ambitions that go far beyond the casual -- and, indeed, the usual branded sports star collaboration.

Let us now pause for a brief history of Mr. Federer's off-court style: He was voted GQ's Most Stylish Man of 2016, beating out Tom Hiddleston, Jared Leto and Jaden Smith (among others). He attended the 2017 Met Gala in a Gucci tuxedo complete with a giant rhinestone cobra on the back. This is a man who went to the Oscars in 2016 in a Louis Vuitton tux. Who attended the Chanel show the same year in a suit and turtleneck.

Who, in fact, has attended a healthy number of shows, including Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen, with his famous BFF, Anna Wintour. A man who wore a gray morning suit complete with vest to the 2017 wedding of Pippa Middleton. Who announced, in an Esquire interview: ""I grew up enjoying Prada and Dolce & Gabbana. I love Dior and Louis Vuitton. I also have a lot of Tom Ford's suits, so that's kind of how I got into it."" Who, in other words, has never made any secret of his affinity for the capital-F side of fashion. (Though in insisting he will get his RF logo back from Nike, he clearly has not entirely learned the lessons of the industry, which is littered with designers who lost their names to the big groups that owned them, most notably John Galliano, whose name still belongs to LVMH.) Even Mr. Federer's endorsements outside of Nike have always had a whiff of the haute: Mercedes-Benz, Rolex, Moet & Chandon, Lindt chocolates and NetJets (among others). So while it is easy to believe he may not see his future in fashion as solely sports related, it is more surprising -- and interesting -- to learn he sees it as mass.

And despite its flirtation with fashion via collaborations with runway names like Christophe Lemaire, formerly of Hermes, now designer of a namesake line and artistic director of Uniqlo U; Tomas Maier, the recently deposed Bottega Veneta designer who just did a limited-edition resort collection for Uniqlo; and Jonathan Anderson, the conceptual Briton who is also creative director of Loewe, and who has done two special collections for Uniqlo. Like Jil Sander, the first prominent designer to engage with the brand, all those designers are notably talented but famous largely among fashion insiders and obsessives. Uniqlo, which is owned by the Japanese giant Fast Retailing (a self-explanatory name if there ever was one), has not been a brand that brought bells and whistles to its partnerships, or that inflated the ego by creating noisy marketing campaigns. It is a brand whose mission has been perfecting the basics: the things people wear not because they fantasize about being elite athletes, or because they fantasize about having the lifestyles of elite athletes, but because they fantasize about having functional clothes to wear every day that don't cost a huge amount or call attention to themselves, but still look good. Traditionally, however, being associated with such clothes -- which bridge age, size and sectors -- has not been the fantasy of elite athletes. So while he won't hoist the Wimbledon trophy on Sunday (after his upset loss to Kevin Anderson in the quarterfinals on Wednesday), Mr. Federer may be about to change the game once again."
15485,Pantone Picks Two Colors of the Year for 2021,It's all about the messaging. Get ready for a brighter future.,&ldquo;Illuminating&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ultimate Gray&rdquo; are Pantone&rsquo;s 2021 Colors of the Year.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/10/fashion/09Pantone-1/09Pantone-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/style/pantone-color-2021-ultimate-gray-illuminating.html,ae6491d2-5f3f-51c0-bb7c-f1e6555a44e7.jpg,"There is general agreement on very little in this world, save, perhaps, for one thing: This year has been a mess, and the next one cannot come fast enough. So it should be a surprise to no one that the prognosticators at Pantone -- those trend forecasters who scour the globe for months noting developments in clothing, cars, kitchens, coffee (the stuff that surrounds us) and translate it into a color they claim will be the dominant shade of the coming year -- have chosen, as the color of the year for 2021 ... two colors! Which does not represent indecisiveness, but a metaphor. Get ready for Ultimate Gray and Illuminating. Or, in normal-speak: the light at the end of the tunnel. After Living Coral in 2019 and Classic Blue in 2020, this may not be what anyone expected (that might have been ""grim black""), but it might be what everyone needs.

""No one color could get across the meaning of the moment,"" Laurie Pressman, the vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, said on a call. ""We all realized we cannot do this alone. We all have a deeper understanding of how we need each other and emotional support and hope."" Hence, said Leatrice Eiseman, the executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, the decision to select ""two independent colors really coming together."" No one ever pretended color theory was subtle. Besides, the choice does represent a step forward, of sorts. This is only the second time in the 22 years that Pantone has been choosing a color of the year that two colors have been selected. The first time was in 2015, when Rose Quartz and Serenity were chosen (which is to say, pink and blue for 2016). That year, the two shades were meant to blend into each other, reflecting the recognition of gender fluidity and social progress. But this year, the two shades are meant to stand on their own, as complementary tones, supporting each other. It is also the first time that a gray has earned the honor, and only the second time for a yellow. As it happens, both shades were added to the Pantone color wheel earlier this year, along with Period Red. Imagine if that one had won out.

Not just because choosing a single anything to represent what's next after a year of historic crisis could seem a fool's errand. (Who knows what's next?!) But because the question of consumption, which is intrinsically linked to Pantone's choice, and its status as a marketing stunt, is itself fraught. Also because no one could move around as they had in the past to sleuth out what was happening in the color universe. Ms. Eiseman, for example, said she had not been on a plane since February. Still, between the internet and the Pantone teams in almost 30 countries, the direction things were going was fairly certain by midsummer. The prognosticators began by acknowledging the shades of gray in which we have all been immersed. Indeed, of all the grays in the palette, Ultimate Gray is a determinedly neutral kind of gray. It is not the dark gray of gathering storm clouds or the dour gray of institutional sameness or the dim gray of skulking in the shadows or the soft, luxurious dove gray of Dior, but a more solid, granite-like gray. The kind of gray of wisdom (gray beards!) and intelligence (gray matter!) and construction. One person's dependable is another person's depressing, however, which is where Illuminating comes in. It's not the egg yolk-like yellow of Mimosa, the color of the year of 2009, nor an acidic or highlighter yellow, nor the ""go into the light"" yellow of the afterlife, or sci-fi adventure, but more of a sunshine, or smiley face, yellow."
281,Elizabeth Wurtzel Was a Great Writer and a Better Friend,"Before we met, she was my idol. Once we became close, Lizzie enriched my work and life in new ways.",Elizabeth Wurtzel in 2000.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/08/opinion/08Oswaks/08Oswaks-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=716e8ff767c3f1135ab6db72fcee3fe6122bdf8bb4238e038f25a76db8960d00&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/opinion/elizabeth-wurtzel.html,3b647748-fe81-54b7-90df-fe571e9541f1.jpg,"A few weeks ago, cleaning out my closet ahead of the new year, I found a skinny purple mohair scarf hand-knit for me by a friend in New York, the memoirist and essayist Elizabeth Wurtzel, who died on Tuesday. I wrapped the scarf around my pet, Frances, a black cat with green eyes identical to Lizzie's cat Arabella, took a picture and texted it to her. ""Remember this scarf?"" I wrote. Seconds later, a reply: ""Yes!"" I didn't know it would be the last time I heard from her. I wish I'd said something else while I had her attention. Like ""I miss you,"" which I did, having seen her only a handful of times since moving to Los Angeles three years ago. Or ""How are you?"" I'd been with her at the hospital in 2015, the day she went in for the biopsy that would end up confirming her breast cancer diagnosis. And I'd known from another brief text exchange this past October that her cancer was back, that she was ""just so sick of it."" I'd been trying to reach her about something unrelated, and when she hadn't returned my calls in days, which was unlike her, I texted to see if she was mad at me for something I didn't know about. ""Not at all. Sorry,"" she wrote. ""Going through really difficult stuff with cancer. I would really like to talk to you. I miss you."" I told her to call me whenever she was up for it, but she never did. And I didn't push. So many calls had already gone unanswered. I let the scarf exchange stand because, as I'd discovered in recent years, maintaining a relationship with boundaries with Lizzie was the best way to have her in my life. Sometimes less was more. ""I love you"" or ""I miss you, come visit"" every month or so.

I first met Elizabeth Wurtzel on Sept. 24, 2013, when I visited her at her home in the West Village, an alley-facing garden apartment lousy with framed art and teetering stacks of vinyl records and CDs, empty boxes from one or another Sephora web order and all manner of Jonathan Adler objets d'art. I'd been assigned an article for Playboy magazine's 60th anniversary issue -- interviews with prominent women from entertainment and academia about the state of our sexual lives at that time. As a fan of Lizzie's writing since discovering ""Prozac Nation"" as a freshman at New York University, I took this assignment as my chance to meet my idol. I was 24. They say you shouldn't do that, and I can understand why. But I'm grateful to have had the chance. One thing to know about Lizzie, which won't come as much of a surprise to anyone familiar with her work, is that she'd talk all day and into the night if you'd let her. She loved an audience. She loved to talk at you. She should have had a podcast. Instead, she had a pair of deep, purple suede couches and no bedtime and always plenty of petite sirah and plenty of opinions. She could be quite persuasive. When we met for our interview for Playboy, to talk about sex and feminism, I'd recently moved in with my now ex-boyfriend, which had been conditional upon my sending my cat to live with my parents in California. Over Chinese takeout Lizzie convinced me that this wasn't right, that a good man wouldn't make me choose him over a pet. She loved animals. She said I should leave him. She was at the time single and happy, living with a rescue dog, Augusta, who died a few years ago, and Arabella the cat who knocks everything over. Two months later, I broke up with my boyfriend -- for the first time, and only briefly. I moved out of our shared apartment and stayed at Lizzie's, cat-sitting and writing my article in my literary idol's own home, while she was in Florida visiting family. It was surreal. I'd fantasized for years about running into her in Manhattan. And there I was, in her own bedsheets, under her low ceiling covered in butterfly stickers. She loved butterflies.

She was also by this time clean from hard drugs, having written in a second memoir about her struggles with addiction. But she loved to open a bottle of red wine and listen to records and talk for hours, often offering unsolicited and highly questionable advice. One Lizzie-ism I've only recently started to doubt, for in truth I probably could afford my own health insurance if I wasn't buying Botox all the time: ""Take care of the luxuries, and the necessities will take care of themselves."" She believed in ordering dessert on a Tuesday and opening another bottle late in the night. She believed in buying the things you love in triplicate when possible. She believed in Retin-A and wearing makeup to the bodega and taking regular private Pilates classes and owning many perfumes. She believed in asking for what you wanted. Another Lizzie-ism: ""If you want to make it as a writer, you have to be willing to kill your mother."" She did not mean this literally. She meant that you had to be willing to say the difficult and upsetting thing, to risk hurting someone's feelings in the name of honesty, to not fear the fallout of living an authentic life and writing about it, warts and all. She pushed me and taught me not to play it safe, that it's only worth publishing if it's true, specific and vulnerable. Because otherwise, why bother? Because you can't please everyone, so you might as well please yourself. My most successful work is better for this advice, which echoes in my head always, but especially today. After I moved to Los Angeles, I got sober from drugs and alcohol, and learned to set boundaries where previously there'd been none. That meant not getting sucked into her quicksand every time we spoke on the phone, which could last hours, or spent time together in person, which could go all night if you let it. Too often in the early part of our friendship, I'd leave her apartment feeling drained and vaguely resentful of the hold she had on me. She was herself like drugs, absolutely intoxicating and capable of making you feel like the most important person on the planet. Leaving her presence often involved a sort of comedown. But the clothes were always great.

She always sent me home with a bag of her vintage hand-me-downs: pastel Tocca tank tops, a pink floral Agnes B. blouse. She was as generous as she was difficult, which is saying a lot. After our last visit, in November 2018, while I was in town on an extended layover en route to Morocco for another Playboy story, she gave me a graphite-colored silk dress by the British label Ghost, which now feels macabre. This time we drank seltzer water and fantasized about taking a road trip together to someplace warm, like Palm Springs or the California wine country, with me her designated driver. We spoke of this often, but never made a plan. I wonder if she knew it would never happen. The second-to-last email she ever sent me contained the poem ""Sorry"" by Ntozake Shange. In the subject line she'd written ""just sending this to you because I think you will love it."" The last email she sent me arrived over Thanksgiving, containing Saint Theresa's prayer, which begins, ""May today there be peace within."" She could be tough, but she was incredibly sensitive. ""I take everything personally,"" she once told me. ""If I ever stop taking things personally then I won't care anywhere near as much."" She cared deeply for her friends and the animals in her life, and was not above texting you out of the blue to let you know that you were ""irreplaceable."" She was exhausted by the remission and recurrence of her cancer. Dismayed by our political situation. I can't believe she won't be here to see how it all ends. To write about it. The fact that she's gone is so stupid. I want to call her up and talk about everything. She would find it all so annoying. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

16335,Does It Pay to Be a Writer?,A new study found that most authors' incomes are below the poverty line.,"The decline in earnings are largely because of Amazon&rsquo;s lion&rsquo;s share of the self-publishing, e-book and resale market.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/07/books/07item-writerspay-print/03item-writerspay-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b59ae3bfe55413a99c14a835f4af1aa0e89a0170ac4ff310a9e5475fd2fd9657&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/books/authors-pay-writer.html,ef453ce9-9e88-5d8f-a5fe-b33c715a779d.jpg,"The decline in earnings is also largely because of Amazon's lion's share of the self-publishing, e-book and resale market, Ms. Rasenberger said. The conglomerate charges commission and marketing fees to publishers that Ms. Rasenberger said essentially prevent their books from being buried on the site. Small and independent publishers, which have fewer resources and bargaining power, have been particularly hard hit. Book publishing companies are passing these losses along to writers in the form of lower royalties and advances, and authors also lose out on income from books resold on the platform.

In some ways, these changes are in line with a general shift toward a gig economy or ""hustling,"" in which people juggle an assortment of jobs to make up for the lack of a stable income. But the writing industry as a whole has always eluded standardization in pay. In a conversation with Manjula Martin in the book ""Scratch: Writers, Money, and the Art of Making a Living,"" edited by Ms. Martin, Cheryl Strayed said, ""There's no other job in the world where you get your master's degree in that field and you're like, 'Well, I might make zero or I might make $5 million!'""

In a recent call, Ms. Martin said that ""the people who are able to practice the trade of authoring are people who have other sources of income,"" adding that this creates barriers of entry and limits the types of stories that reach a wide audience. There is also, she added, a devaluation of writing in which it is often viewed as a hobby as opposed to a valuable vocation.

""Everyone thinks they can write, because everybody writes,"" Ms. Rasenberger said, referring to the proliferation of casual texting, emailing and tweeting. But she distinguishes these from professional writers ""who have been working on their craft and art of writing for years.""

""What a professional writer can convey in written word is far superior to what the rest of us can do,"" Ms. Rasenberger said. ""As a society we need that, because it's a way to crystallize ideas, make us see things in a new way and create understanding of who we are as a people, where we are today and where we're going."""
3890,Independent Restaurants Brace for the Unknown,"Big chains seem equipped to weather the coronavirus shutdowns, but smaller businesses are scrambling for help from governments and customers.","JoAnn Clevenger, shown here in 2015 at Upperline, wrote out her last paychecks to her 24 employees on Thursday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/20/dining/20virus-restaurants1/merlin_170791059_1ae1e3f1-7b9f-4ec1-9681-ef8a3a583832-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=61aca41f9313dd0fbed42805e6757d705485e43ff7ec8dd8826db0c7663f6bbe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/dining/local-restaurants-coronavirus.html,90ebdfd6-3da8-5da4-bef9-aa8a63399def.jpg,"It took two months for JoAnn Clevenger to reopen Upperline, a traditional Creole restaurant in New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina devastated that city in 2005. This time, a virus has closed the place, probably for a lot longer. It didn't take long for her to realize that a takeout operation wouldn't keep the business alive, and the odds that she will reopen anytime soon are against her. On Thursday, Ms. Clevenger wrote out the last paychecks to her 24 employees, some of whom had been with her for more than 25 years. ""Stay safe, stay in touch,"" she wrote on each one. ""You're what makes the Upperline great."" The prognosis for independent operations like hers seem dire. From big cities like New York to smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala., restaurants have been forced to close their dining rooms; many have simply shuttered, while others are relying on takeout and delivery. Cities like Omaha and Tempe, Ariz., have limited the number of guests, but closings are on the horizon. Large chains and well-funded restaurant groups have the resources to ride out a protracted shutdown, but the independent restaurants that make up about two-thirds of the American dining landscape -- noodle shops, diners and that charming urban restaurant that always had a line out the door -- may not survive.

""It's a lot more difficult than saying, 'Let's hunker down for a month and a half, and then we open and everything is fine,' "" said Tom Colicchio, the New York chef and television personality who himself laid off 300 people across seven restaurants. Mr. Colicchio on Friday released a detailed set of recommendations to Congress from a newly formed group of independent restaurant owners who are scrambling to put pressure on the federal government. ""This is going to take a year,"" said Mr. Colicchio, who believes that the 75 percent failure rate isn't an exaggeration. ""The world just changed. The enormity of the problem here is so big people can't wrap their heads around it.""

But many restaurants, both big and small, aren't going down without a fight. Customers and owners, including Mr. Colicchio, are staging a fast-growing offensive, from selling groceries to lobbying governments for policy changes and financial help. The National Restaurant Association asked the federal government Wednesday for a $145 billion recovery fund. The request, sent to President Trump and Congress, includes loan programs, $35 billion in grants for restaurant disaster relief in regions and communities especially hard-hit, and help in paying unemployed workers. The package also proposes a series of tax cuts and credits, and federally backed business-interruption insurance. Traditional business-interruption policies are expensive, and some exclude coverage for pandemics. Restaurants with those policies are already taking on their insurers. Oceana Grill, in New Orleans, filed a lawsuit Monday asking a state judge to affirm that the restaurant's business-interruption policy covers its current closing.

A group of New York's top chefs and restaurant groups have formed Relief Opportunities for All Restaurants, a coalition to pressure state and local governments to help save the industry. ""We are on the brink of extinction,"" reads the group's petition on change.org. Their first initiative is pushing Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to postpone sales tax payments. The coalition also wants the state to help ease rents, provide emergency employment benefits and make speedy changes to zoning and permit laws so restaurants can sell alcohol to take away or use their spaces as boutique groceries. In Tampa, Fla., Jordan Johnson is betting on the grocery idea. He spent nearly a year preparing to open Naked Farmer, a fast-casual restaurant serving food from local farms. He was planning to start training 20 employees next week for a grand opening on April 1 when it became clear that it wouldn't happen. So he pivoted. He cut his staff to four, and decided to become a digital farmers' market that home-delivers fresh produce like arugula and sweet potatoes. The goal is to expand to prepared foods, all in an attempt to keep a few people employed and pay the crushing $6,000 in rent on a dining room he can't use. ""We're not as devastated as maybe a fine-dining restaurant that didn't have a delivery mechanism,"" he said. ""If we didn't come up with this idea, we would just be sitting on the couch doing nothing and looking at all the conspiracy theories."" Customers are trying to do their part, too. Online fund-raising campaigns for individual restaurants are popping up almost by the hour. The visitors' bureau in Charlotte, N.C., is keeping a running list of restaurants providing food for takeout or delivery. A national social-media campaign with the hashtag #toosmalltofail was started Friday, urging customers to call lawmakers and lobby for help on behalf of independent restaurants.

In Brooklyn, the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club, a crew who regularly ply the Gowanus Canal, posted a crowdsourced list of restaurants and other businesses in the neighborhood that are still open. Members have started paddling along the canal with a hand-painted sign urging people to buy gift certificates. ""Every individual out there has agency,"" said Brad Vogel, who painted the sign. ""Even if you're home alone you can do something,"" Still, the realization is sinking in that many restaurants will be able to survive only so long on takeout. Gift cards help, but many customers buy them knowing they are likely microloans, with no guarantee that the restaurant will be around long. Gadi Peleg owns Nur, a 59-seat modern Middle Eastern restaurant in the Flatiron district of Manhattan whose menu is overseen by the Israeli chef Meir Adoni. He doesn't know how long it and LamaLo, his other restaurant, will able to keep going offering food to go, or the direction his other business, Breads Bakery, will take. Mr. Peleg wouldn't say how many people he has laid off, but said he has consolidated the two restaurants into one kitchen, has cross-trained cooks to produce both menus and is doing everything he can to keep people working.

""We've cut it to a point where we are trying to remain sustainable,"" he said. ""What I am telling my staff is that the present is impossible to decipher right now. We are trying to focus on the future."" When that future comes, reopening restaurants will come as a slow wave. Chains, which have the legal resources and corporate structures to navigate the complex process of securing government loans and grants, will probably reopen quickly, analysts say. Small, nimble places with simple menus, like burger joints and taco stands, may also be able to react quickly. But the longer the shutdown goes on, the more lead-time fine-dining restaurants and places with complex menus to execute will need. ""Even if we're only off for three months, you can't just turn the light switch back on,"" said Danny Meyer, who this week laid off 2,000 employees, about 80 percent of his Union Square Hospitality Group work force. ""It will take at least four to six weeks to get back on your feet."" And the restaurant landscape will likely look very different. Daniel Shein, a partner in Nur, is trying to raise capital for Agnoris, a start-up software company designed to help restaurants use data to run more efficiently. He presented the idea to investors Monday as part of ""demo day"" at Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley initiative that helps start-ups refine their products and pitch them to selected audience of investors. The paradox of pitching a product for future restaurants while trying to save one from dying is not lost on him. Like others, including Mr. Colicchio, Mr. Shein said the only bright spot in the crisis is a chance for the restaurant industry to renew itself. Before the virus hit, the nation's restaurant business was almost overheated, with new places opening faster in many cities than diners could keep up with. Restaurants were essential amenities for developers and gentrification markers in neighborhoods. Rising rents, labor shortages and struggles to find a better way to care for and compensate employees were constant topics of conversation. When the industry does start up again, many say it will be a time to let go of outdated business practices and develop new, more creative ways to feed people.

One example is Porridge & Puffs, in Los Angeles. A week ago, its chef and owner, Minh Phan, was canceling events faster than she could rewrite contracts. In the span of two hours, all her reservations evaporated. She has only six employees, and made a promise to keep everyone for as long as she could. So far, none have had their hours cut, but she is dipping into her savings to pay them. On Thursday, the team cleared out the dining room to make the restaurant into a food shop, selling comforting rice porridge, prepared foods like pickles and jams, bundles of flowers and bulk pantry staples for home cooks, from rice to two-pound bags of dried chickpeas. The restaurant's website now allows customers to place orders in advance, and the staff packs to-go boxes for curbside delivery in Historic Filipinotown. ""But it's not a great long-term plan,"" Ms. Phan said. Supplies will be increasingly difficult to buy, and labor is expensive. If the situation goes on for six months or a year, Ms. Phan will figure out another plan, adapting to keep the lights on. ""I'm optimistic,"" she said. ""I'm scrappy. I thrive during wartime.""

The Treasury Department, which leads a group reviewing the deal for national security purposes, provided TikTok's owner, ByteDance, with revisions to its proposal on Wednesday, one of the people said. Some of the revisions were intended to address how TikTok's data and source code would be handled and secured, one of the people said. The two sides have agreed in principle, but are still discussing some technical details, the other person said.

The exact ownership structure of TikTok under the proposed deal is unclear. President Trump and some members of his administration have said ByteDance cannot retain a majority stake in TikTok if their concerns are to be satisfied. Oracle, the Silicon Valley business software maker, is set to be a technology partner for TikTok while taking an ownership stake in the app, but would not own it outright, people with knowledge of the situation have said.

Any resolution on ownership could involve some tricky math. The percentage of TikTok owned by non-American interests depends partly on how officials treat the portion of ByteDance, a privately held company, that is already backed by American investors, one person said."

Last fall, just a few days into my trip to the Shetland Islands, the Scottish subarctic archipelago across the sea from Norway, I found myself on the top of a cliff face, peering through the fog at a huge rock in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The rock was topped with a spike of white: the Muckle Flugga lighthouse, built in 1854, a mind-boggling feat as the rock's cliff face juts straight up out of the roiling sea. In the early days of the lighthouse, our tour guide told us, men had to be hoisted by ropes around their arms to safely cross the gap between their boat and the landing area on the rock. At this most northerly point in the U.K, I felt a profound sense that I was very far from home. I had disembarked to this spot from a bus at the very top of the tiny island of Unst, the most northern and rocky of the Shetland Islands, with a population of about 600. On the bus with me was a group of mostly women from all over the world, all of us attendees of Shetland Wool Week, a knitting and textile festival hailed through the world's knitting grapevine as the mecca of all knitting and textile festivals. To get to this spot, the bus had driven us up the length of ""mainland"" Shetland, the largest of the 16 populated islands, then crossed on a ferry to the smaller island of Yell, then driven up a snaking road to Yell's tip and to a second ferry ride (this one on more of a raft than a boat, the bus exposed on all sides) to the island of Unst.

Today, knitters in Shetland are unambiguously celebrated for their vision and skill; frequent signs on the road advertise local designers whose homes double as shops. The growing resurgence of interest in knitting around the world -- likely directly linked to our digital age -- has made knitting festivals worldwide increasingly popular (tickets for classes at knitting festivals in Edinburgh or Iceland, for example, sell out within hours). In as small and remote a place as Shetland, however, the festival is actually helping to bring textiles back into view as a player in the economy. There are about 100 islands in Shetland, though only 16 are inhabited. To get to mainland Shetland, one either takes an overnight ferry or a small plane from Aberdeen, on the coast of Scotland (I took the ferry, a very memorable roller-coaster experience on the heaving sea that I'm nonetheless not sure I want to experience again).

Some of the smaller islands' municipal needs are taken care of from Lerwick on mainland Shetland, the islands's central port and biggest city (with a population of about 7,500), which is also where the hub of the festival is. Schoolchildren often travel to Lerwick during the week and then back to the smaller islands to spend the weekends with their families. Mystery writer Ann Cleeves has set a series of murder mysteries on Shetland (they were made into an excellent BBC series, ""Shetland,"" that the islanders are understandably quite proud of), and one can easily see why: driving around the tiny islands is an experience in moodiness --- you snake down one-way roads through pockets of brightly painted houses and grazing sheep, the seething ocean on one side or the other of you (or sometimes both, the North Sea on one and the ocean on the other). Often when you curve around a bend in the road the view before you is breathtaking, and if you are driving a car you have to be careful not to drive right off the road. Cliffs drop precipitously just feet from the pavement; inlets have choppy waves (and, in summer, killer whales who pick off sleepy seals), enormous rocks jut up from the ocean just off the coast, and everywhere, roofs and boats and houses are painted cheerful colors that burst against the overcast sky.

The wind is a large part of life on the islands: as winter approaches, everything that might blow away is removed from yards --- wheelbarrows, lawn mowers, wooden benches. When the lighthouse keeper still lived at the Eshaness (a lighthouse on the northwest of the main island -- there are upward of 34 lighthouses on the islands), our guide told us, he used to chain his car to the cliff to make sure it didn't blow away. There aren't many trees in Shetland, for this reason -- the same reason we were given for why native Shetland ponies and sheep are so diminutive. In the winter, there is a month of near-perpetual darkness, and in the summer, a month of continuous sunlight; the wind, I was told, is constant no matter the time of year, though at certain times it is known to gust harder, stronger, or more or less predictably (in September, the month I was there, the winds are known as ""the Equinox gales""). The people of Shetland, though, really could not be nicer -- one is tempted to think their isolation and hardiness has formed them for kindness. At the bed-and-breakfast where we stayed, Virdafjell, the owner, Dorothy Stove, greeted us with a plastic bin of clean house slippers for us to choose from, and every morning put out a breakfast spread fit for 10 hungry men (though my friend and I were the only people there): scones, assorted bread, eggs, yogurt, fruit, at least 10 different kinds of cereal, and even decorative butter slices in a perfectly sized dish. Considering the size of Shetland, Wool Week is incredibly vast and diverse. The program is eight full days, and each day features myriad classes and exhibitions, tours, gatherings, teas and lectures on nearly all of the islands; on a random day, I counted 54 different offerings.

Community halls in tiny towns all over the islands host Wool Weekers every day, local people serving lunch or tea and exhibiting local crafts -- a day tour of the main island, for example, included a stop at Ollaberry Hall, an exhibition space on the west shore, where a table more than eight feet long boasted plate after plate of handmade cakes and cookies (""homebakes""), and local women served us all tea. This spread accompanied an exhibit of lace haps (or shawls) -- most of them made by local schoolchildren -- knitted with cobweb-thin yarn, so thin the whole shawl could pass through a wedding ring. My fellow bus-riders and I, once all the shawls had been exclaimed over, sat and happily ate the homebakes while working on whatever knitting project we had brought with us. There is a lot of knitting, as one might imagine, being done during SWW. For such a small place, Shetland offers an incredible amount to attract visitors. In addition to the textile industry, visitors are drawn by archaeology -- (there are ancient sites scattered all over the islands), by geology (the islands sit atop a network of tectonic plates and boast an array of ancient and volcanic rocks), by caving and kayaking, and by an enormous diversity of nesting seabirds (puffins, who nest there in the 100s of thousands in the summer, are a popular draw).

Despite all of this, the main action at the time of my visit was Wool Week, which begins Sept. 28 in 2019. One of the festival's distinctive aspects is the community that it creates and celebrates all over the islands; it feels as if every local person who has anything to do with textiles or wool is featured in some way, be it Oliver Henry, the wool sorter at Jamieson's and Smith, one of the two largest purveyors of Shetland wool (the other being confusedly, coincidentally named Jamieson's of Shetland), who gives a talk about the job of sorting and grading wool against the backdrop of his garage-like space overflowing with wool fleeces, or Wilma Malcomson, a local knitwear designer, whose workshop you can find by a sign tacked onto the main road, and who teaches a class on knitting with multiple colors. (Wilma is the designer of the knitwear worn by the detective on the BBC's Shetland -- I bought a sweater from her from a prototype for about $100, and she knitted and mailed it to me within two weeks.) Even Hazel Tindall, the world's fastest knitter (325 stitches every 4 minutes, I was told), herself local, teaches a few classes.

A highlight of my week was a visit to Uradale Farm, one of six organic farms on the islands, where Ronnie Eunson, the farmer, gave us a tour of his property and talked us through the process of making the all-organic yarn that he and his family produce and sell. The farm is high on a hill overlooking many rolling acres and the sea; it was raining the day we were there, but the view was still staggering and the sheep unimpressed. Getting there was a bit of a challenge -- as with most everywhere on the islands, there are no street addresses, so one has to know the landmarks one is looking for, or pray that Google recognizes what you are searching for and can lead you to the correct dropped pin.

After he talked, he brought us into his colorful home (a rainbow is painted on the ceiling) for tea and more homebakes, and spoke a bit more generally about the increased interest that Wool Week has brought to Shetland (he and his wife also then let us shop for wool in their living room). One of the organizers I spoke to said that Wool Week in 2017 brought in more than 700,000 pounds (or about $900,000) to the local economy, and that doesn't include all that was spent at local shops, restaurants, or B & Bs by the 600 attendees. In 2018, nearly 700 people made the trip, primarily from Europe, the United States and Canada, but also from many farther-flung places such as Australia, Japan, Egypt, Lebanon, Indonesia and Israel. Where is all of this attention coming from? The BBC series has helped, as has perhaps a general back-to-basics interest in those of us who feel increasingly distanced from a natural form of community in our modern world. One doesn't want to get too positive -- nearly every person who shared with us the good news about a resurgence of interest in the knitting industry was also quick to share the difficulties their line of work still faces (the general demand is still for inexpensive, mass-produced white wool, and the market for handmade goods is still small and imperiled) -- but standing on the shores of Shetland during Wool Week, a knitter can't help but feel optimistic, and a person can't help but feel swept away.

Meet the Woman Who Is the 'Best Thing That Ever Happened' to 'Game of Thrones'

""Game of Thrones"" stars past and present filled Radio City Music Hall earlier this month for the world premiere of the first episode of the fantasy saga's eighth and final season, which debuts Sunday on HBO. But in their speech before the screening, the creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss gave some of their deepest thanks to someone who most of the crowd probably wouldn't recognize. ""We only made it this far because of Bernadette Caulfield, the greatest producer alive,"" Benioff said. [Read our complete guide to ""Game of Thrones"" and sign up for our newsletter.] Caulfield, an executive producer for the show, isn't as familiar to fans as Benioff or Weiss or actors like Emilia Clarke (who plays the dragon queen Daenerys Targaryen), Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark) and Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister). But for those people, she is the real star of ""Game of Thrones."" ""She's the beating heart of our show,"" Clarke said. ""The woman that I want to grow up to be like,"" Turner said.

""The single best thing that ever happened to the show,"" Benioff and Weiss wrote in a joint email. Even as writers and showrunners have become celebrated in this age of intensely dissected series, television is still made mostly by the unsung -- all those names in the credits that turn the scripts into actual television. This is especially true for ""Game of Thrones."" With its sprawling tale unfolding in a wide variety of environments, it was almost certainly the most technically complicated series ever made, at times running five units (film crews) simultaneously, on multiple continents, to complete a given season on time. And they rarely shot simple scenes -- ""Game of Thrones"" became a sensation partly through gobsmacking sequences involving elaborate battles, people on fire and the occasional bear. It inhabited cliffs, crypts and caves in Northern Ireland. It closed city streets in Spain and Croatia to film riots, insurgencies and a nude walk of shame. It took a crew into an Icelandic blizzard to capture the world beyond the Wall.

""Without her, the whole thing would have collapsed under its own weight long ago,"" Benioff and Weiss said. ""Well, I wish I was that important,"" Caulfield said when I reached her in England, where she's working on Joss Whedon's new series, ""The Nevers,"" for HBO. ""But obviously it takes a major team to put it together."" That team included her ""wingman,"" the producer Chris Newman, and the show's production designer, Deborah Riley, among many, many others. But Caulfield was the person in charge of everything, the creators said, overseeing all aspects of the production, from the enormously complex logistical planning to the budget and production schedule to the ""health and happiness of the crew."" For Caulfield, however, the task was relatively straightforward. ""My job is to make whatever they write on the page come to the screen,"" she said. Caulfield grew up in upstate New York and went to high school in Rochester, where she also worked in local theater. When a movie filmed in the area in 1981, she signed on as a production assistant and was bitten by the show-business bug -- she moved to Los Angeles within a year. As she rose through the industry ranks, she worked with some of the most esteemed producers in Hollywood, including Steven Bochco (on ""Brooklyn South"" and ""Philly""), Michael Mann (""Robbery Homicide Division"") and Ridley and Tony Scott (""The Good Wife"").

She honed her multiple-unit chops as a producer on ""The X-Files"" and then later on the HBO polygamy drama ""Big Love."" As that show was wrapping up in 2011, she heard about ""sort of a fantasy, medieval piece"" the network was shooting in Britain. She joined ""Game of Thrones"" for its second season, replacing the outgoing producer Mark Huffam. It's easy to forget now, given the cavalcade of spectacle ""Game of Thrones"" has become, that it was a much quieter show in the early days. The dragons were glorified lizards and the first big combat sequence, the Battle of the Blackwater, didn't come until the end of Season 2. Season 3 brought signs of the expansion to come, with new worlds and more extreme elements, like the bear that Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) squared off with in one gonzo sequence. ""Gwendoline said, 'I can't believe I'm working with a live bear here!,' and David said, 'I know, I didn't believe that Bernie would actually do this,'"" Caulfield recalled, laughing. ""I didn't think I had any option but to do it.""

 As the story and budgets grew, from $5 million per episode in the early days to as much as $15 million in Season 8, so did the production. If it wasn't explicitly a goal for the show to top itself each season, that was the practical result of a story that grew from a clash of clans to a transcontinental war to -- this season -- a battle against an undead army for the survival of humankind.

""She created a production that could effectively scale up from season to season without losing either its efficiency or its heart,"" Benioff and Weiss said. ""There are so many versions of 'Game of Thrones' that would have fallen apart under the strain of producing 10 increasingly big hours of television on a 12-month schedule. Pretty much every version except the Bernie version.""

 When Caulfield wasn't on some far-flung set or checking out the action on any of the six stages at the show's Belfast studio, she was in the production office planning -- prepping new directors, new shoots, new countries. ""It really was the Game of Meetings,"" she said. But it was her ""gruff love of every damn person on the show,"" Benioff and Weiss said, that made her beloved by the people she was ordering around in often extreme conditions. ""I know how heavy cable is; I know what the crew has to go through -- I'm actually married to a dolly grip,"" she said. ""Sometimes he'd say, 'You love your crew more than me.' Probably at that moment I do, because I have to."" The most emotionally taxing days were the ones that involved lighting people on fire. Stunt coordinators will generally say falls are the most dangerous, but the shoot that sticks in Caulfield's memory is the scene in the fighting pits of Meereen in Season 6, when the big dragon Drogon -- on set represented by a long pole with a ball on the end -- torched multiple victims. The execution of the scene involved a flamethrower on a dolly rolling past, igniting multiple stunt performers. ""They say they don't worry and they love doing it, but I think they're all crazy,"" she said. The maternal dynamic extended to the actors, whose growing fame led to ever more demanding schedules to juggle as the show itself became more physically strenuous. ""She literally was the mum of the whole thing,"" Clarke said.

""It was like, 'Listen, I know we're in the middle of a field and it's 3 a.m. and it's the second month of night shoots and everyone's exhausted and everyone's screaming at you because you are the person that everyone comes to for everything, but can I just talk to you about this Dothraki line I've got next week?'"" she added. ""And she will."" Caulfield's angst antenna bordered on the uncanny, they say. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays the redeemed rogue Jaime Lannister, recalled a time when a stressful personal situation had him on the brink of an on-set tantrum. ""Suddenly she was next to me very gently saying, 'Hey are you O.K.?'"" he said. ""And just the way she said that made me look at myself from the outside and see that I was about to turn into one of those horrible actors."" He continued, ""So I am really grateful that she stopped me from becoming a complete fool."" Caulfield acknowledged that whatever considerable scheduling, weather and budgeting obstacles she overcame on ""Game of Thrones,"" her most important attribute on a production full of ice and fire and many flavors of human toil, was her emotional intelligence. ""I do feel like I'm sensitive to seeing somebody who's not smiling as much,"" she said. ""I still run into a lot of different crew, and you know, you hug them like you don't want to let go,"" she said. ""A lot of people felt like it was time to move on, but I also think if it went on another five years, everybody would have hung in there for five years. Because it meant that much to all of us."""

Friday at 7 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College, East 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, 212-772-4448, dancespatrelle.org. (Schaefer)  Andy de Groat & Catherine Galasso (through Saturday) In the 1970s, before Ms. Galasso was born, her parents were members of the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds, a company founded by the avant-garde director Robert Wilson. It was there that they met the choreographer Andy de Groat, with whom her father, the composer Michael Galasso, went on to collaborate. Honoring this artistic lineage, Ms. Galasso remounts several works by Mr. de Groat and offers her own response to his pedestrian yet convoluted movement. The evening, titled ""get dancing,"" also includes ""Rope Dance Translations,"" a film accompanied by live performance. At 8 p.m., St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org. (Burke)

East Village Dance Project (Thursday through Dec. 20) The themes of escape and self-discovery found just under the surface of ""The Nutcracker"" take fresh, poignant form in the East Village Dance Project's production of ""The Shell-Shocked Nut Project,"" which sets the action amid East Village landmarks and follows the journey of a war veteran. The cast of 50 is split between students and professionals, and Tchaikovsky's score shares airtime with Stevie Wonder, Duke Ellington and original music played live. Thursday through Dec. 19 at 8 p.m., Dec. 19 and 20 at 3 p.m., La MaMa, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, lamama.org. (Schaefer) Gelsey Kirkland Ballet (through Dec. 20) It's worth seeing this company's ""Nutcracker"" not just for a well-constructed production of the Christmas classic, but also for a glimpse of the troupe's new Brooklyn home, at what used to be St. Ann's Warehouse. Founded in TriBeCa by Ms. Kirkland, a former American Ballet Theater principal, the company attracts promising young dancers from around the world, who will be joined by 70 students and alumni from the affiliated Gelsey Kirkland Academy of Classical Ballet. Thursday and Fridays at 7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Sundays at noon and 5 p.m., GK Arts Center, 29 Jay Street, near John Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, 800-838-3006, gelseykirklandacademyofclassicalballet.org. (Burke) Bill T. Jones and Dianne McIntyre (through Saturday) In its shift toward more multigenre programming, New York Live Arts has been presenting a series of concerts by the contemporary classical music ensemble yMusic. To go with that music, the last installment includes some dancing by two luminaries of modern dance: Bill T. Jones, the artistic director of Live Arts, and the divine Dianne McIntyre. Each artist offers a new solo, Mr. Jones on Friday, Ms. McIntyre on Saturday. At 7:30 p.m., 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, newyorklivearts.org. (Burke)  Juilliard Dances (Friday through Tuesday) Though still in school, the talented dancers of the Juilliard conservatory could fool you for professionals. In their winter showcase, ""New Dances: Edition 2015,"" they are paired up, by academic year, with well-respected contemporary choreographers in original works. The first-year dancers perform Helen Simoneau's ""Strange Garden"" and the second years tackle Aszure Barton's ""return to patience,"" with both works set to music played by other Juilliard students. The third-year dancers team up with Zvi Gotheiner and the fourth years collaborate with Kyle Abraham. Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Lincoln Center, 155 West 65th Street, events.juilliard.edu. (Schaefer) Keigwin + Company (through Sunday) With a new plan for his company, Larry Keigwin is not so much passing the choreographer's torch as he is sharing it with a younger generation. For his troupe's return to the Joyce Theater, he has commissioned new works by the rising dancemakers Adam Barruch and Loni Landon, while creating two new pieces of his own and bringing back his 2009 ""Sidewalk,"" set to Steve Reich's ""Double Sextet."" The Keigwin vibe is relentlessly fun, and some fresh voices should only amplify that. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Burke)  Mark Morris Dance Group (Saturday through Dec. 20) After a five-year hiatus, Mark Morris's ""The Hard Nut,"" a rollicking, cheeky take on ""The Nutcracker,"" returns to Brooklyn. The narrative hews closely to E.T.A. Hoffmann's original story, but the show is a welcome departure from tradition - and propriety. Mr. Morris plants his party in the suburbs of the 1970s and visits a world inspired by Charles Burns's noirish Pop Art. Mr. Morris's snowflakes blur gender lines while his characters crack open their inhibitions. It's wacky fun. Saturday and Wednesday through next Friday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 1 and 6 p.m., Dec. 19 at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Dec. 20 at 1 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Schaefer)

 New York City Ballet (through Jan. 3) Of the dozens of ""Nutcracker"" productions in town, none match the scale of City Ballet's ""George Balanchine's The Nutcracker,"" or the giddy sense of childlike awe it inspires. Pantomime dominates the first half but Act II culminates in a breathtaking pas de deux for the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier. After all, this is a duet for Balanchine and Tchaikovsky, too, and it's magical. At various times, David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-496-0600, nycballet.org. (Schaefer) New York Theater Ballet (Friday through Sunday) Returning for its fifth year, ""Keith Michael's The Nutcracker"" trims Tchaikovsky's score to a brisk and efficient hour so as to keep the attention of the little ones. (The show is recommended for children as young as 3.) Mr. Michaels, a longtime choreographer for this company, sets his version in 1907 and takes inspiration from the colorful and energetic Art Nouveau movement that by then had swept Europe. Friday at noon, Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m., 1 and 3:30 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, 212-355-6160, nytb.org. (Schaefer)  Noche Flamenca (Friday through Jan. 23) Traditional Spanish dance and ancient Greek theater are an unlikely but well-suited pair in Noche Flamenca's sharp production ""Antigona,"" based on Sophocles's famous tragedy. The dance lights a fire under the play while discovering in itself a knack for narrative drama. In the title role, the powerhouse Soledad Barrio is both fierce and fragile. The century-old church where the performance takes place is filled with striking sets, darkly amorous music played by a live band and a ferocious Greek chorus of dancers. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., with an additional performance at 3 p.m. on Dec. 26 (no performances on Dec. 24 and 25), West Park Presbyterian Church, 165 West 86th Street, Manhattan, 866-811-4111, nocheflamenca.com. (Schaefer)  Tere O'Connor (through Saturday) A news release for Tere O'Connor's new work, ""The Goodbye Studies,"" said it will ""embrace tangent and anomalous structural conceits."" Head scratching though that may be, Mr. O'Connor consistently manages to turn such esoteric ideas into surprising and satisfying dances of substance. Here, he employs his strong sense of drama and a knack for meaningful gestures to examine his group of 12 dancers as a single entity rather than individual beings -- which is quite a task since individually, they're captivating. At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Schaefer) Peridance Dance Company (Friday through Sunday) Igal Perry's contribution to the seasonal dance staple is ""The Nutcracker -- A Contemporary Look."" Ballet is one of several styles - like hip-hop and contemporary dance -- integrated into his version, which features nearly 100 dancers from his company and affiliated school. Tchaikovsky is there, of course, but so is Strauss, as well as other modern musicians. The costumes range from traditional to psychedelic; the show's idea of a ""contemporary look"" is an eclectic one. Friday at 8:30 p.m., Saturday at 6:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 and 7 p.m., Peridance Capezio Center, 126 East 13th Street, East Village, 212-505-0886, peridance.com. (Schaefer)  Urban Bush Women (through Saturday) John Coltrane's groundbreaking album ""A Love Supreme"" turns 50 this year, and Urban Bush Women, the powerful all-female troupe founded by Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, turns 30. ""Walking with 'Trane,"" choreographed by Ms. Zollar and Samantha Speis in collaboration with the company, salutes those anniversaries through a dance structured like a jazz record, with an A-side and a B-side. The composers George Caldwell and Philip White take inspiration from Coltrane in their original score. At 7:30 p.m., Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Burke) Works & Process: 'Peter and the Wolf' (Friday through Sunday) Thankfully, neither ""The Nutcracker"" nor Tchaikovsky has a monopoly on your holiday season. In a clever bit of counter programming, the Guggenheim Museum's performance series presents its annual production of ""Peter and the Wolf,"" Prokofiev's playful adventure. The fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi is responsible for the look and direction of this short and sweet show for children, while the choreographer John Heginbotham makes it move. At 2:30 and 4 p.m., Peter B. Lewis Theater, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, 212-423-3500, worksandprocess.org. (Schaefer)"
29077,More Than 150 Women Described Sexual Abuse by Lawrence Nassar. Will Their Testimony Help Them Heal?,"The psychological effects of disclosing a traumatic secret — of telling your story — depend on the audience, the nature of the trauma and other factors.","Melody Posthuma Van der Veen confronts Dr. Lawrence B. Nassar, former physician of the American gymnastics team, in court in Lansing, Mich., earlier this month.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/27/science/27CATHARSIS/27CATHARSIS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bcee11fc5836d696df6adefa4eb11412594ca41d30afee0b26b84e9deb27a963&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/health/nassar-victims-testimony.html,f5c1ae44-25db-58d1-998d-f74304c2fe20.jpg,"More Than 150 Women Described Sexual Abuse by Lawrence Nassar. Will Their Testimony Help Them Heal?

The spectacle of more than 150 young women telling their stories of sexual abuse before a court, the world, and the perpetrator himself seemed straight from the movies, a cathartic ending to a dark, yearslong drama that had been all too real. It is rare, perhaps unprecedented, for so many victims to stand in court and, with the encouragement of a judge, to describe aloud for days the abuse they endured. Therapists said that the chance to testify at the sentencing hearing of Dr. Lawrence B. Nassar was worth taking for those who felt ready to do so. The women were taken at their word; they were part of group, bonded by shared experience; and they saw justice done before their eyes ""I can't think of a better scenario,"" said Elaine Ducharme, a psychologist in Glastonbury, Conn., who specializes in treating trauma from sexual abuse and other violations. ""To have the judge hear them, to allow their stories to influence her decisions, and all without putting them through the trauma of an actual trial. Most of them are likely to have felt tremendous relief.""

One of the more surprising recent findings was the discrediting of what is called critical incident stress debriefing: the practice, once common, of pushing people still reeling from a traumatic event, like an earthquake or school shooting, to talk through its effects. Studies have found that such debriefings had no impact on subsequent symptoms of traumatic stress for most people -- and made some individuals feel worse. The implication was that recounting a tale of trauma shortly after it happens does not necessarily contribute to healing it. ""It was hard to believe what the data were saying,"" said Richard McNally, a professor of psychology at Harvard. ""But you just don't know what effect interventions really have until you test them.""

People do best when allowed to tell their stories in their own time, if they choose to do so at all, therapists said. The details of a person's trauma are another consideration. Memory is a shape-shifting, idiosyncratic process, with a life of its own. For reasons no one understands, some people who were sexually abused as children exhibit no measurable psychological wounds as adults, research suggests; nor do they ruminate on past violations.

Others feel the wounds as freshly today as ever, reacting with extreme emotion to benign, random reminders in everyday life: a hand on a shoulder, a half smile from a stranger, the sight of a doctor's office. For such people, unloading their story -- even in the safety of a supportive group, directly meting out justice to a perpetrator -- can provide relief, but not resolution, therapists said. ""It's often a beginning, not the end,"" said Dr. Ducharme. ""There will be more work to do."" One of the most striking features of the recent court proceedings was the sight of so many survivors directly witnessing -- and helping seal -- the perpetrator's comeuppance. Seeing justice done is widely believed to be a psychological balm in itself, a gratifying, if usually belated, repair of faith. But justice does not always deliver relief, studies find, and the reason may lie in the type of trauma experienced. In a study of torture survivors, Dr. Metin Basoglu, a professor of psychiatry at the Istanbul Center for Behavior Research and Therapy, found that symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression did not depend on the victim's sense that justice had been served. ""Testifying in court might be helpful not necessarily because of restoration of a sense of justice, but because of the exposure element the whole court process involves,"" Dr. Basoglu said in an email. The value in telling the story may not be that it leads to justice, then, but that it helps the speaker regain control of a narrative that plays out endlessly in his or her mind."
25342,"Mary Abbott, Abstract Expressionist, Is Dead at 98","She traveled in the same circles as Pollock and de Kooning, but recognition in a male-dominated genre often eluded her.","Mary Abbott in her New York studio in about 1950. She was part of a circle of artists that included de Kooning, Motherwell, Pollock and Kline, though she never received the recognition they did.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/obituaries/01abbott1/01abbott1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=f8458bf411d2850e8049aa49e8a001536f3b30c691d09a3db01bb0ac3910d8ca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/arts/design/mary-abbott-dead.html,9ac2b150-ed54-549d-bfe0-126a7a391c7f.jpg,"Mary Abbott, who was at the heart of the Abstract Expressionist movement in New York in the 1940s and '50s but, like other women painting in that genre, received far less recognition than her male counterparts, died on Aug. 23 in Southampton, N.Y. She was 98 . Thomas McCormick of the McCormick Gallery in Chicago, which represented her, announced the death. Ms. Abbott painted bold, colorful works, often inspired by nature or music, and traveled in the same circle s as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and other artists who were redefining painting in the years after World War II. De Kooning in particular, 17 years her senior, became a friend, lover and protector, including from some of the other male artists. ""I didn't like Pollock much,"" Ms. Abbott related in an interview for the biography ""de Kooning: An American Master,"" by Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan (2004). ""When he was sober he didn't talk, and when he was drunk Bill had to keep pulling him off of me."" That vivid description conveys what women trying to make a name for themselves in that world were facing.

""Mary Abbott was an early participant in the development of Abstract Expressionism,"" said Gwen Chanzit , curator of the 2016 Denver Art Museum exhibition ""Women of Abstract Expressionism,"" which included works by Ms. Abbott, ""but like other women painters, she was mostly left out of historical accounts of this male-dominated movement. Only now are the women of Abstract Expressionism beginning to be recognized for their contributions."" Unlike some of her contemporaries -- among them Lee Krasner (1908-84), Pollock's wife, and Jay DeFeo (1929-89) -- Ms. Abbott lived to see a resurgence of interest in the work of female Abstract Expressionists.

""To see this and other early works by Ms. Abbott together is a treat,"" Benjamin Genocchio, reviewing a 2008 show at the Spanierman Gallery in East Hampton, N.Y., featuring several of her paintings, wrote in The New York Times, ""for most come from private collections and have rarely been publicly shown. Few of her works are on permanent display in New York-area museums. That is a shame, for she is one of the last great Abstract Expressionist painters of her generation."" Mary Lee Abbott was born on July 27, 1921, in New York City , and for her first two decades seemed headed for an entirely different sort of life. Her father, Henry, was a Navy captain and recipient of the Navy Cross, and her mother, Elizabeth , a poet and syndicated columnist, was a member of the socially prominent Grinnell family. Ms. Abbott was first singled out in The Times and other newspapers not as an artist but as a debutante, her high-society activities documented in painstaking detail.

""Debutantes of this season, headed by Miss Mary Lee Abbott, granddaughter of Mrs. William Morton Grinnell, were among the groups rehearsing this morning at Conscience Point for the Southampton tercentenary pageant, 'Founded for Freedom,'"" The Times reported on Aug. 9, 1940, ""which will be given next Wednesday and Thursday at North Sea, within sight of the landing place of the community's first settlers."" By then, though, Ms. Abbott had already begun taking classes under George Grosz at the Art Students League in Manhattan. After a foray into modeling -- she appeared in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and other magazines -- she moved in 1946 into a cold-water flat at 88 East 10th Street, near Washington Square Park, and plunged into the artist life. De Kooning, according to ""An American Master,"" used to bring her kerosene to make sure she had heat. They were romantically involved for some years. ""There were no dinners,"" she was quoted as saying in that book. ""There wasn't money for that. Then later we went to the Cedar Bar."" That tavern was a famed gathering place for avant-garde artists and writers. Pollock, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell and other noted Abstract Expressionists congregated there.

Ms. Abbott was by then separated from Lewis Teague, an artist she had married in 1943, and in 1949 she went to the Virgin Islands to obtain a divorce from him. There she met Tom Clyde, a retired investor, and they married the next year. They had a residence on Long Island, but because he had back problems, they spent winters in Haiti and St. Croix, and Ms. Abbott's paintings began to be influenced by the people and lush landscapes she found there. Later, when she had once again settled in Southampton, her garden inspired her work.

""Mythology and religion were touchstones, but nature was Abbott's lifelong interest,"" Ms. Chanzit said by email. ""Her free brushwork was particularly inspired by place and by the variations of color and light in the natural world. Her paintings were never documents of specific sites, but her personal responses to them."" She and Mr. Clyde divorced in 1966, and she spent the 1970s teaching at the University of Minnesota. Then she returned to the East Coast, for some years dividing her time between a loft on West Broadway in Manhattan and a small house in Southampton. A decade ago she finally gave up the loft. In 2017 the online gallery IdeelArt wrote about Ms. Abbott, pondering why she was not better known. ""How is it that an artist whose work is considered to have had a profound impact on one of the most important art movements of the past century is also somehow practically unknown to contemporary audiences?"" the article asked. ""Based on interviews Abbott has given, things like having her accomplishments touted, getting credit for her influence and being recognized for her contributions to art history are of little importance to her. Still active in her studio today in her mid-90s, Abbott seems content to focus on what she believes is most important: making art; and to let irrelevancies like reputation handle themselves."""

On Thursday -- as the men's fashion circus swirled in Florence at the Pitti Uomo trade fair -- the designer confirmed long-rumored plans for a men's line, to debut Nov. 10 in London alongside her spring women's collection, the one that used to be presented in May but that has now moved to a see-now/buy-now schedule, with the show taking place just before the clothes go on public sale. Similarly, the men's wear will be sold a month after the big reveal, hitting shelves in early December. ""The desire to marry the Stella woman to a man has been inside me since the very beginning,"" said Ms. McCartney, herself a Stella woman married to a man, on announcing the news.

""My time on Savile Row"" -- she trained with the tailor Edward Sexton after graduating from Central St. Martins -- ""inspired so much of what I do, and it feels like the right moment to talk to men and give them what they deserve,"" she said. ""I want to deliver to men what I deliver to women.""

""A wardrobe, a choice and effortless modern clothes,"" she said. Translation: Like her women's wear, the men's wear will be leather- and shearling-free, and, like her women's wear, it will be a full collection, encompassing suits and separates, outerwear and accessories; eyewear is in the works. However, unlike her women's wear, the men's collection will not be associated with any particular season: The line, which will continue to be shown with Ms. McCartney's pre-collections and not on the classic men's wear schedule, will be called something like Collection One and Collection Two (it will be sold to wholesalers a few months before it is shown to the press and public). The theory is that men buy differently from women: They see something, and if they like it, they want to get it immediately. And they do not think in trends. As to what the clothes might look like, that's still a secret. But some clues may be found in Ms. McCartney's past.

The designer has dabbled in men's wear before, making suits for both her husband, Alasdhair Willis (a jazzy midnight-blue double-breasted tuxedo with black lapels), and her father, Paul McCartney (a single-breasted tartan tux atop classic black trousers), to wear to the Met Gala in 2011. She has done bespoke pieces for Guy Ritchie and David Bowie, and she makes all the competition and off-duty Olympic Village clothing, including some urban athleisure sweats, for the male and female members of Britain's Olympic team in collaboration with Adidas. The overall look for both is kind of tailored, no-fuss hipster.

If those men buy it, why wouldn't everyone else? After all, there is nothing new about brands making their names in women's wear and then segueing into the men's market, often very successfully, much like Lanvin, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton. And though all those brands have named men's wear designers running the men's side of the business (Lucas Ossendrijver, Kris Van Assche and Kim Jones), Miuccia Prada has been as influential in men's wear design as she has been in women's wear, and at Hermes, the long-term men's creative director, Veronique Nichanian, has given the men's line its own clear identity. The biggest risk may lie in the fact that Ms. McCartney has built her identity as a designer on the idea of being a ""woman designing for women,"" as she told The Guardian in 2014, and there is some ambivalence around how that will translate for men. Part of her calling card has been a willingness to eschew capital-f Fashion statement-making for real life statement-making, focusing on clothes that allow a customer to move seamlessly from breakfast waffles to power meeting to margaritas in Ibiza with seemingly effortless aplomb. That's not necessarily a gender-specific aesthetic, but it has been sold that way in the past. Of course, we no longer live in such gender-specific days. So perhaps the real question is: What took her so long?"
59463,A Delightfully Oddball Block,"Seventy-fifth between Broadway and West End Avenue is an interesting mix of row houses, town houses, Tudor prewars and white brick apartment houses.","The north side of West 75th Street, from Broadway to West End Avenue, in 1899, when the buildings were new.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/24/realestate/24STREETS1_SPAN/streets-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=375&w=600&s=df66cd752a90f24c326e1072ba67c6258a8c615220088842e3c5a81c42d04e61&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/realestate/streetscapes-west-75th-street-a-delightfully-oddball-block.html,753f0bfd-f39c-556b-b8f8-eac1f95cb341.jpg,"NOT all great New York blocks are end-to-end mansions. A case in point is the short stretch of West 75th between Broadway and West End Avenue, a curious mix of bedraggled row houses and spiffed-up town houses, of Tudor prewars and white brick apartment houses. If you need a big, fancy street, this isn't it; in fact, it's just the opposite. In 1884 the architect/developer William J. Merritt filed plans for rows of houses covering both sides of the block, and in 1885 The Real Estate Record and Guide reported that he was offering them with a money-back guarantee. A period photograph of the row on the north side shows a bestiary of bays, porches, peaks, gables, dormers -- as much a wrestling match as a streetscape. At the same time, they were as lovable as anything you'll see in the Home section.

But cuddly doesn't go far with architectural critics. Montgomery Schuyler coined the term ""wild work"" and ""reign of terror"" for this type of styling. Although he admired the modest dimensions of such dwellings, he called the entire block ""an atrocity,"" writing it off as ""the nadir of the small house in New York."" The early owners were the usual assortment of the well-to-do: lawyers, businessmen and others. In 1894 The New York Times reported that Mrs. Thomas Fuller, of 252 West 75th Street, had returned from her country house and ""will receive on Fridays until further notice."" Another resident was Emma H. Lockwood, the secretary of the Audubon Society of New York State, who campaigned to end the use of the feathers of wild birds for women's hats; she lived at 243 West 75th. In 1896 she told The Evening Telegram that she had found her effort ""utterly discouraging"" and wished that fashionable women could see ""the hunter who rips the plumes from the poor half-killed"" herons, egrets and other birds. Perhaps it was Miss Lockwood who put the help-wanted ad with the return address of 243 West 75th in an 1899 issue of The New York Sun seeking ""a Protestant woman"" for cooking and laundry who was willing ""to go to the country for the summer.""

The private houses off Broadway lost their cachet quickly, and in the early 1920s three apartment houses went up on the block: 240 and 250 West 75th, designed by George F. Pelham, perhaps for the Paterno family; and 245 West 75th, by the developer-architect Fred French, who later built Tudor City. A walk down this block is as good as a Saturday-afternoon double feature; the contemporary observer should find the fizzy mix of style and substance not alarming but refreshing. Going east from West End Avenue, note that the stone on the house at No. 254, the one with the porch-under-the-arch-over-the-oriel, has been painted. That generally produces a tsk-tsk from preservationists, but the result is an agreeable contrast between the hot red brick and the yellowy cream of the paint. Next door, No. 252 has been reconstructed in the last few years into a puzzling modernist work. Over what appears to be a glass curtain wall, the owners have installed a screen of open slats in deep red, with vertical accents in very dark gray. The ground floor is a near blank wall of blackish panels, perhaps metal rectangles.

Across the street, French's apartment building at 245 West 75th is a medieval-style work, of which the city has dozens. But this one is full of delights: the off-center half-timbering on the upper section, the irregular crenelations at the roof, the slight chamfer at the corner. Go up close to the brick on the ground floor: within the mortar bedding, French put thin strips of slate, a cunning little decorative detail. Pelham's apartment house at 250 West 75th is a homey mix of Gothic and medieval, with irregular stones surrounding the doorway and windows. The house at No. 236 has been treated to another agreeable paint job; note the mid-20th century infill on the doorway and half-round window. Its neighbor at No. 234 has an owner who has done extensive work on the house. Much rings hollow, but the red paint picking out the swags in the cornice is a nice trick. Merritt would surely not recognize Nos. 241 and 243 West 75th, details sheared off, facades coated with grim gray stucco -- they look like something out of the Communist bloc. Their little tragedy only serves to point up the lively, riotous vitality of this oddball, out-of-the-way street. No masterpieces, no grand statements, no capital-L landmarks, just great street architecture, the kind that rewards close looking."

After a yearslong fan campaign on social media to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, Warner Bros. announced Wednesday that the studio would allow Zack Snyder to recut the 2017 comic-book film ""Justice League"" for a planned debut on HBO Max in 2021. ""Since I got here 14 months ago, the chant to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut has been a daily drumbeat in our offices and inboxes,"" said Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of Warner Media Entertainment. ""We are thrilled to finally deliver."" The move will return Snyder to a cinematic comic-book universe where he once served as the primary architect. In the early 2010s, as Warner Bros. searched for a way to compete with Marvel Studios and its lucrative stable of big-screen superheroes, the company tapped Snyder, the ""300"" director, to reinvigorate several well-known DC Comics characters, beginning with Superman (played by Henry Cavill) in the 2013 blockbuster ""Man of Steel.""

Snyder added Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) to the crew for the 2016 ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" but the film's dark tone and dismal reviews spooked Warner Bros. executives, who pushed Snyder to lighten up as he began shooting an even bigger sequel, ""Justice League."" After a troubled production, Warner Bros. announced in May 2017 that Snyder would be stepping down from ""Justice League"" in the wake of his daughter's suicide, and the studio tapped ""The Avengers"" director Joss Whedon for extensive reshoots.

Whedon scripted 80 additional pages for the endeavor, but his quippy tone and more colorful aesthetic proved to be at odds with Snyder's grim, chiaroscuro take on the crime fighters, and the reshoots presented a significant scheduling problem: Cavill had already moved on to ""Mission: Impossible -- Fallout,"" and the mustache he grew for that film had to be inelegantly erased from his new Superman scenes. Whedon's patched-together ""Justice League"" was released in November 2017 to scathing notices, earning significantly less than Gadot's solo film, ""Wonder Woman,"" which had debuted just a few months earlier. Though that seemed to spell the end of ""Justice League"" as a franchise, Snyder's fans continued to clamor for his director's cut, and last November, Affleck and Gadot added their online voices to the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement. Warner Bros. Pictures chairman Toby Emmerich then contacted Snyder to gauge his interest in remaking the film for the soon-to-launch streaming service HBO Max, and the director assented. Since the Snyder cut of ""Justice League"" was never completed, the studio will probably pour $20 million to $30 million into an extensive, effects-heavy postproduction process to bring it up to snuff. It may also prove to be significantly longer than Whedon's two-hour version: In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Snyder said that he was mulling a four-hour director's cut of ""Justice League,"" or even a six-part episodic series that could restore several trimmed subplots, including separate story lines for the Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). Though this is an unprecedented about-face for Warner Bros., the move makes sense as studios reel from a pandemic-forced shutdown: Snyder's ""Justice League"" guarantees HBO Max a high-profile project that can be fashioned out of already-shot footage, and it provides a visibility bump for its stand-alone superheroes. Gadot's sequel ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was moved to a late-summer berth after movie theaters closed for the season, while new films starring Jason Momoa's Aquaman and Miller's Flash may not be able to go into production for a long time.

There's even a chance that Snyder's revised take on ""Justice League"" could pre-empt the studio's fresh look on Batman: Matt Reeves was in the middle of filming a Batman reboot with Robert Pattinson when Hollywood shut down, and its summer 2021 release has been delayed as the studio scrambles to figure out how to resume production. Would Warner Bros. really give us two completely different takes on the Caped Crusader in such short succession? Better add some new bulbs to the Bat signal."

One member, Michael Palin, far right, said after her death, ""Python benefited so much from her quiet, persistent enthusiasm.""





Nancy Lewis, whose single-minded belief that Americans would find a quirky British comedy troupe amusing was instrumental in getting that troupe's breakthrough show, ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" broadcast on American television, died on Dec. 20 in Manhattan. She was 76. Her husband, the actor Simon Jones, said the cause was leukemia. Ms. Lewis was head of publicity for Buddah Records, an American company, when in 1971 it struck a distribution deal with the British label Charisma Records that included two albums by Monty Python. The troupe had become famous in Britain after the debut of ""Flying Circus"" on the BBC in 1969 but was virtually unknown in the United States. Ms. Lewis championed the albums and then the television series, finally getting it on the air on PBS in 1974. The next year, when ABC broadcast an edited compilation of the show in its weekday late-night slot, she urged the troupe to go to court to try to stop a second such broadcast on the grounds that the editing ruined much of the Pythonesque humor, which relied on running gags, incongruity and absurdity. The suit didn't stop the second broadcast, but on appeal it did establish that the Pythons owned the copyright to the ""Flying Circus"" episodes, an important precedent.

Michael Palin, one of the troupe's six members, posted a tribute to Ms. Lewis on his blog after her death. ""Python benefited so much from her quiet, persistent enthusiasm,"" he wrote. Nancy Carol Lewis was born on Feb. 20, 1943, in Detroit to Mack and Carol (Schulz) Lewis. ""Heavy-duty fundamental Protestant religion ruled -- dancing was one of many major sins,"" she wrote of her childhood in an essay years later. Yet she developed a taste for Elvis Presley and other early rock 'n' roll. After graduating from Redford High School in Detroit, she earned a bachelor's degree in film and television production at Michigan State University in 1964. While in college she was a campus correspondent for Billboard, and after graduating she went to New York and then London, where the rock scene was exploding. She found work writing for a pop music magazine, Fabulous, and in early 1965 interviewed an emerging band called the Who. She didn't think they'd be around long. ""They didn't seem to like each other very much, and they were such different people, I just could never see them lasting,"" she told the writer John Swenson. She would soon be the group's publicist. She also helped promote Jimi Hendrix, Joe Cocker, Traffic and other acts in the 1960s.

Ms. Lewis alternated between the United States and England, working for Island Records and Track Records before landing at Buddah in 1971. Among her proudest accomplishments there, Mr. Jones said, was helping to introduce the English band Genesis in the United States. It was part of the Charisma distribution deal, which brought Ms. Lewis a stack of the label's releases. ""There were quite a few interesting records,"" Ms. Lewis wrote in a program note for ""No Naughty Bits,"" a play by Steve Thompson that was based on the Pythons' case against ABC and that was produced in London in 2011. ""but what really caught my eye were two LPs at the bottom of the pile -- 'Another Monty Python Record' and 'Monty Python's Previous Record.'""

She began taking the troupe's records to FM radio stations, which she knew were willing to try new things and play longer cuts. The Pythons started developing American fans, but there was still a reluctance to import the TV series. Converting the episodes to the format used in the United States was expensive, and there was a fear that ""Flying Circus"" was too full of Britishisms to interest Americans, not to mention too saucy. But Ms. Lewis kept at it, and on Aug. 12, 1974, Mr. Palin was able to write in his diary (which he later published in book form): ""Stop Press: Writing my diary at 11:15 when the phone rings. It's Nancy from New York, almost speechless with good news. As from October, the entire Python first series is being screened on American TV by PBS."" PBS affiliates began showing the series, and Ms. Lewis became the Pythons' American manager. In 1975, when ABC (which had bought the rights to the show's fourth season from Time-Life) broadcast the first installment of the intrusively edited compilations, it was Ms. Lewis who brought the butchery to the Pythons' attention. They were displeased.

""Any reference to bodily function, any slightly risque word, anything, as Douglas Adams put it, 'to do with life,' was single-mindedly expunged,"" Mr. Palin wrote in his diary. ""Our reaction,"" he added, ""turned from disbelief and amazement to anger and outrage."" Ms. Lewis was among those who pushed the troupe to sue ABC. The case led to a sometimes comical proceeding in federal court in New York in which the Pythons, seeking an injunction to stop the second broadcast, tried to put across why the unabridged versions of their sketches were funny and the edited ones were not. Ms. Lewis was among those who testified. Morris E. Lasker, the judge, agreed that the editing had caused the material ""to lose its iconoclastic verve."" But he denied the request for an injunction on the grounds that ABC would suffer substantial losses if the broadcast, less than a week away, were canceled, and that the ownership of the copyright for the material was unclear. An appellate court ruled the next year that the troupe owned its material. Ms. Lewis continued to represent the Pythons in the United States. It was while working on the 1983 film ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life"" that she met Mr. Jones, who was in the cast. They married in late 1983. (Ms. Lewis went by Nancy Lewis Jones thereafter.) Mr. Jones, in a phone interview, said Ms. Lewis had also helped the Pythons on their individual projects. When Mr. Gilliam got into a dispute over the editing of his acclaimed 1985 movie, ""Brazil,"" Mr. Jones said, it was Ms. Lewis who clandestinely showed Los Angeles critics Mr. Gilliam's cut of the movie. The Los Angeles Film Critics Association gave the film its best picture, best director and best screenplay awards."
10554,A Geopolitical Earthquake Just Hit the Mideast,The Israel-United Arab Emirates deal will be felt throughout the region.,"President Trump, with officials from Israel and the United Arab Emirates, on Thursday announced an accord between the two Mideast countries.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/14/opinion/14friedman_print/13friedman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=56ad1e260b3fc9e4842d31b05a30a29634f0f7e381f09398c0575b545edda901&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/opinion/israel-uae.html,790ea955-2bc4-582f-b384-4b16fe0062d5.jpg,"For once, I am going to agree with President Trump in his use of his favorite adjective: ""huge."" The agreement brokered by the Trump administration for the United Arab Emirates to establish full normalization of relations with Israel, in return for the Jewish state forgoing, for now, any annexation of the West Bank, was exactly what Trump said it was in his tweet: a ""HUGE breakthrough."" It is not Anwar el-Sadat going to Jerusalem -- nothing could match that first big opening between Arabs and Israelis. It is not Yasir Arafat shaking Yitzhak Rabin's hand on the White House lawn -- nothing could match that first moment of public reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. But it is close. Just go down the scorecard, and you see how this deal affects every major party in the region -- with those in the pro-American, pro-moderate Islam, pro-ending-the-conflict-with-Israel-once-and-for-all camp benefiting the most and those in the radical pro-Iran, anti-American, pro-Islamist permanent-struggle-with-Israel camp all becoming more isolated and left behind. To fully appreciate why, you need to start with the internal dynamics of the deal. It was Trump's peace plan drawn up by Jared Kushner, and their willingness to stick with it, that actually created the raw material for this breakthrough. Here is how.

The Kushner plan basically called for Israel and the Palestinians to make peace, with Israel being able to annex some 30 percent of the West Bank, where most of its settlers were, and the Palestinians getting to establish a demilitarized, patchwork state on the other 70 percent, along with some land swaps from Israel. The Palestinians rejected the deal outright as unbalanced and unjust. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who basically helped to write the very pro-Israel plan, said he intended to proceed with the annexation part of the plan by July 1 -- without agreeing to the part that his political base of Jewish settlers rejected: Palestinians later getting a state on the other 70 percent. (I wonder if Trump's ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a pro-settler extremist himself, encouraged Bibi to think he could get away with this.) It didn't work, because Kushner, who was hearing regularly from Egypt, Jordan and the gulf Arabs that such a unilateral Israeli annexation would be a total deal-breaker for them, told Bibi, ""Not so fast."" Kushner persuaded Trump to block Bibi's cherry-picking of the plan by taking annexation now. This was causing Netanyahu to lose support from the settlers -- and, at a time when he is on trial on corruption charges and facing daily protests outside his home over his poor performance in leading Israel out of the coronavirus epidemic, left him sinking in the polls. So what Trump, Kushner, Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, the de facto leader of the Emirates, and Netanyahu did was turn lemons into lemonade, explained Itamar Rabinovich, one of Israel's leading Middle East historians and a former ambassador to Washington.

""Instead of Israeli annexation for a Palestinian state, they made it Israeli non-annexation in return for peace with the U.A.E.,"" said Rabinovich in an interview. Kushner, he added, ""basically generated an asset out of nothing, which Israel could then trade for peace with the U.A.E. It was peace for peace, not land for peace."" This process apparently started after the U.A.E.'s ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, published a letter in Hebrew in the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot in June directly warning that Israeli annexation of the West Bank would undermine the quiet progress Israel had made with the gulf Arabs. The U.A.E. had been mulling going for more open diplomatic ties with Israel for a while, but it was the discussions over how to stop annexation that created a framework where the U.A.E. could be seen as getting something for the Palestinians in return for its normalization with Israel. The Netanyahu dynamics here are fascinating, or as Israeli writer Ari Shavit remarked to me: ""Netanyahu is trying to get out of his own personal Watergate by going to China. He's like Nixon in reverse.""

What he meant was that Netanyahu had been doing everything he could to appease the right-wing forces in Israel -- with shiny objects like annexation -- so they would side with him in his corruption trial against Israel's court system and attorney general. By taking this deal, Netanyahu, as Nixon did with China, abandoned his natural ideological allies -- the settlers who supported him because they thought he would deliver annexation -- ""and this will force Netanyahu to become more dependent on the center and center-right in Israel going forward,"" said Shavit. ""This deal may help save Israeli democracy by now depriving Bibi"" of the full army of right-wing forces ""he needed to destroy the Israeli Supreme Court.""

The Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas, was also stripped of something by this deal, which may force him to the negotiating table. It stripped him of his biggest ace in the hole -- the idea that the gulf Arabs would normalize with Israel only after the Israelis satisfied the demands of the Palestinian Authority with a state to its liking. This deal will certainly encourage the other gulf sheikhdoms -- Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- all of which have had covert and overt business and intelligence dealings with Israel, to follow the Emirates' lead. They will not want to let the U.A.E. have a leg up in being able to marry its financial capital with Israel's cybertechnology, agriculture technology and health care technology, with the potential to make both countries stronger and more prosperous. Three other big winners here are: 1) King Abdullah of Jordan. He feared that Israeli annexation would energize efforts to turn Jordan into the Palestinian state. That threat is for the moment defused. 2) The American Jewish community. If Israel had annexed part of the West Bank, it would have divided every synagogue and Jewish community in America, between hard-line annexationists and liberal anti-annexationists. This was a looming disaster. Gone for now. And 3) Joe Biden. Biden, if he succeeds Trump, will not have to worry about the thorny issue of annexation, and he should have a much stronger pro-American alliance in the region to work with. The big geopolitical losers are Iran and all of its proxies: Hezbollah, the Iraqi militias, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Houthis in Yemen and Turkey. This is for a number of reasons. Up to now, the U.A.E. has kept up a delicate balance between Iran and Israel, not looking to provoke Iran, and dealing with Israel covertly. But this deal is right in Iran's face. The tacit message is: ""We now have Israel on our side, so don't mess with us."" The vast damage Israel inflicted on Iran through apparent cyberwarfare in recent months may have even given the U.A.E. more breathing room to do this deal. But there is another message, deeper, more psychological. This was the U.A.E. telling the Iranians and all their proxies: There are really two coalitions in the region today -- those who want to let the future bury the past and those who want to let the past keep burying the future. The U.A.E. is taking the helm of the first, and it is leaving Iran to be the leader of the second.

When the Trump administration assassinated Qassim Suleimani, the head of Iran's Quds Force, the foreign-operations branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in January, I wrote a column saying that America had just killed ""the dumbest man in Iran."" Why? Because what was Suleimani's business model, which became Shiite Iran's business model? It was to hire Arab and other Shiites to fight Arab Sunnis in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Syria -- to project Iran's power. And what was the result of all this? Iran has helped to turn all four into failed states. Iran's clerical leadership has become the largest facilitator of state failure in the Middle East -- including its own -- which is why so many Lebanese blame it and Hezbollah for their country's mismanagement that led to the devastating explosion last week in Beirut's port. I have followed the Middle East for too long to ever write the sentence ""the region will never be the same again."" The forces of sectarianism, tribalism, corruption and anti-pluralism run deep there. But there are other currents -- young men and women who are just so tired of the old game, the old fights, the old wounds being stoked over and over again. You could see them demonstrating all over the streets of Beirut last week demanding good governance and a chance to realize their full potential. The U.A.E. and Israel and the U.S. on Thursday showed -- at least for one brief shining moment -- that the past does not always have to bury the future, that the haters and dividers don't always have to win. It was a breath of fresh air. May it one day soon turn into a howling wind of change that spreads across the whole region. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Yet if the level is so high, why have so many companies' income tax bills added up to zero? That's what a new analysis of 258 profitable Fortune 500 companies that earned more than $3.8 trillion in profits showed. Although the top corporate rate is 35 percent, hardly any company actually pays that. The report, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning research group in Washington, found that 100 of them -- nearly 40 percent -- paid no taxes in at least one year between 2008 and 2015. Eighteen, including General Electric, International Paper, Priceline.com and PG&E, incurred a total federal income tax bill of less than zero over the entire eight-year period -- meaning they received rebates. The institute used the companies' own regulatory filings to compute their tax rates.

How does a billion-dollar company pay no taxes? Companies take advantage of an array of tax loopholes and aggressive strategies that enable them to legally avoid paying what they owe. The institute's report cites these examples: Multinational corporations like Apple, Microsoft, Abbott Laboratories and Coca-Cola have ways of booking profits overseas, out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. (Those companies were not among the 258 whose rates were calculated by the institute, which said it could not verify the breakdown of their profits between the United States and other countries.)

Citing evidence in the report, Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, introduced a bill on Thursday to eliminate tax loopholes that encourage companies to shift activities offshore. ""The truth is that we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations,"" Senator Sanders said. ""Offshore tax haven abuse has become so absurd that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is now the 'home' to more than 18,000 corporations."" Others, like American Electric Power, Con Ed and Comcast, qualified for accelerated depreciation, enabling them to write off most of the cost of equipment and machinery before it wore out. Facebook, Aetna and Exxon Mobil, among others, saved billions in taxes by giving options to top executives to buy stock in the future at a discount. The companies then get to deduct their huge payouts as a loss. Facebook used excess tax benefits from stock options to reduce its federal and state taxes by $5.78 billion from 2010 to 2015, the institute found. Individual industries have successfully lobbied for specific tax breaks that function as subsidies: for instance, drilling for gas and oil, building Nascar racetracks or railroad tracks, roasting coffee, undertaking certain kinds of research, producing ethanol or making movies (which saved the Walt Disney Company $1.48 billion over eight years, the report says).

These industry-specific subsidies mean that the goodies were not evenly distributed. Utilities logged an effective tax rate of just 3.1 percent over the eight-year period. Industrial machinery, telecommunications and oil, gas and pipeline companies paid roughly 11.5 percent. Internet services paid 15.6 percent. In just two sectors -- health care and retail -- companies paid more than 30 percent of their profits in federal income tax. ""One of the things that jumps out pretty starkly is there's a real gap between the tax rates paid by different industries,"" said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the institute and a co-author of the study. ""When the biggest companies aren't paying their fair share, that means the rest of us are left to pick up the slack. It means small business and middle-income families are paying more."" But Tara DiJulio, a spokeswoman for General Electric, called the report ""deeply flawed and misleading."" ""G.E. is one of the largest payers of corporate income taxes,"" she said. ""Over the last decade, G.E. paid $32.9 billion in cash income taxes worldwide, including in the U.S., and pays more than $1 billion annually in other U.S. state, local and federal taxes."" She added: ""The tax code is complex and outdated, which is exactly why tax reform must happen this year. G.E. has long been advocating to simplify and modernize the tax system -- even if it means we pay more in taxes."" Tax reformers have long argued that the nominal 35 percent federal rate on corporate profits more often than not functions like a strike-through price -- an artificially inflated number that sounds high but rarely applies. Thanks to a variety of loopholes and tax-dodging methods, those 258 corporations paid an average rate of 21.2 percent. (Other studies, including a new one by the Congressional Budget Office that compares corporate income tax rates in various countries, have found that average and effective rates in the United States are lower than the nominal rate.)"

Is the future of men's wear nonbinary people? It is if the designers behind the indie label Krammer & Stoudt are to be believed. In just five seasons, Mike Rubin and Courtenay Nearburg, who are married, have proved themselves a pair worth watching. (Last month Mr. Rubin, 59, was awarded the Fashion Group International's Rising Star award.) The couple's shrewdly assembled collections have played on influences that ranged unfettered from the German Neo-Expressionist dandy Markus Lupertz to the Orange County surf culture memorialized in the novels of Kem Nunn (sometimes referred to as surf fiction's dark lord) to the live-rough transients known as gutter punks. This season, Krammer & Stoudt summoned shades of the playwright Sam Shepard to create a collection ostensibly influenced by Mr. Shepard's seldom-performed ""Cowboy Mouth"" (written with Patti Smith), and yet more notably inspired by the thrill Ms. Nearburg felt when she stumbled last year upon Terra Juano, a model known on Instagram (@Renegades_) as TJ, or Skinnybonejones.

Dressed for the Krammer & Stoudt show in a rejiggered hooded Army M65 fishtail parka, its body elongated and its sleeves shortened; a patch-pocket wool shirt that looked like a supersize version of a standard-issue Pendleton; a pair of drawstring wool trousers Mr. Rubin based on a favorite pair of vintage Capri pants; and a high-crowned Esenshel rabbit velour hat with a brim the size of a cartwheel, TJ looked like an incredibly cool butch girl or a very pretty femme boy or both at once or something altogether in-between. Like many of the models cast for the show -- among them Madison Paige (@madspaige), Arta Gjonbalaj (@artagee), Rain Dove (@raindovemodel) and Merika Palmiste (@merikatheone) -- TJ identifies as nonbinary. And the lineup may reflect a reality the fashion world has been struggling to accommodate -- mashed-up men's and women's shows is one example -- for some time. ""There is this evolution happening -- as opposed to a revolution -- of people recognizing themselves outside of gender specificity,"" Ms. Nearburg wrote in an email before what would be the first men's wear show in this observer's memory in which not a single model was male.

""Krammer & Stoudt has a loyal following among nonbinary people, L.G.B.T.Q. women and straight women,"" she wrote. ""Often we are asked if it's 'okay' for these people to buy our clothes. Of course it's okay."" What is more, Ms. Nearburg said on Monday, recognizing an inevitable tropism away from traditionally defined gender identities opens up not only potential new markets, but also many design possibilities. ""The practical reason for doing this is that people like TJ and Mads and those in their generation or younger are not comfortable confining themselves to a gender definition any more,"" Ms. Nearburg said. Yet, as she learned during her years in the 1990s punk scene in Austin, Tex., gender play as a way of subverting societal norms is one of fashion's time-honored tools. Back when her club uniform was a sleeveless man's T-shirt, a leather biker jacket and trousers, Ms. Nearburg found that her apparent androgyny made her attractive across the spectrum of gender identities. ""I was hit on by straight men, gay men, gay women, straight women,"" she said. ""That was part of my inspiration for doing the casting this way,"" she said. ""We're deliberately not casting feminine-presenting men because we're doing a masculine show. It's still men's wear we're dealing with here. We wanted masculine-presenting women, androgynous women, gay women who consider themselves female, nonbinary women, because we wanted to demonstrate how that space is opening up at a culturally regressive time."" There was something else. ""You look at people like TJ and Madison and they are just so badass and cool,"" Ms. Nearburg said."

Lupus is a potentially fatal autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the skin, joints and internal organs. Its cause is unknown.

Researchers studied 54,763 civilian women enrolled in a larger health study. They used questionnaires to determine exposure to trauma, including serious car accidents and sexual assault, and examined medical records to find diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder. Over the 24 years of the study, they found 73 cases of lupus.

Compared to women without trauma, women with PTSD were almost three times as likely to have lupus. Exposure to trauma, even without having symptoms of PTSD, more than doubled the risk of developing the disease.

The study, in Arthritis & Rheumatology, controlled for oral contraceptive use, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, education and other characteristics."

Smith for The New York Times



Every Plant Has a Story. You Just Need to Dig.



As a matter of habit, Greg Grant leaves his varmint gun at home when he gives a garden tour. But on a late winter Saturday afternoon in Arcadia, Tex., while Mr. Grant was tramping between a stand of native bamboo and a spray of spider lilies, Sonny Boy Desalvo Fontenot caught wind of an armadillo. Sonny Boy, one of Mr. Grant's four critter dogs, started barking and baying, and Acer, the Jack Russell, joined in. Next, the rat terriers got into it. And the botanical lecture came to a temporary halt. ""We didn't bring a gun,"" Mr. Grant said, as he peered through the woods for the dog pack. ""They're not happy until you're all involved."" The armadillo -- or maybe a skunk? -- had worked its way into tree roots above the red clay banks of Grandma's creek. And the furious barking had persuaded the animal to stay put. Mr. Grant, 55, has roamed these acres since he was a boy. He is, in fact, the fifth generation of his family to occupy the little house up the hill. He's the seventh generation to live here in Shelby County, in the piney woods between Dallas and Shreveport, La. And as the area's pre-eminent horticulturist and de facto natural historian, Mr. Grant knew how to handle a cornered armadillo: walk away.

Rain check on the country hospitality, thanks. The home gardens that Mr. Grant has been restoring here for the past 30 years leave no room for fussiness. He plants and weeds with a tractor disc and a Bush Hog. He manages invasives, woody brush and weeds with a gas can and a drip torch. On one hand, the way he gardens is practical. Mr. Grant has been purchasing empty buildings and property up and down the road: He maintains three houses, the church picnic grounds, the derelict town store and the mail cubbies salvaged from the old Arcadia post office. And you can't manage 50 acres with a hand trowel.

All of Mr. Grant's parcels lie along a two-lane farm-to-market road, running south to north. You could walk it in 20 minutes. But this being Texas, we hopped in the truck. Mr. Grant rolled past his second house, white with a pyramidal roof, which previously belonged to Miss Lou, the late shopkeeper. Behind the building lies his next project: 20 acres of longleaf pine savanna. Or the start of it, at least. Two centuries ago, the longleaf -- Pinus palustris -- covered 90 million acres of the American Southeast: vast reaches from the Carolinas to East Texas that supported more than 200 bird species. Logging swallowed big swathes of the savanna; cotton and sugar plantations chewed up the leftovers. Today, less than 3 percent of the ecosystem remains. The longleaf pine, with its tufts of needles, some 18 inches long, looks a little like the bearskin hat worn by the Queen's Guard, stuck on a teetering rack. Starting a few years back, Mr. Grant transplanted 12,000 trees (""not all of them survived""). Next, he scattered an understory of grasses: little bluestem, big bluestem, splitbeard bluestem, broomsedge bluestem, et cetera. Controlled burns each spring clear out the oaks and hardwoods that predominate everywhere else.

With its boxy geometry and dogtrot porch -- three rooms on one side of the breezeway and two on the other -- the folk-style house looks like a collaboration between Donald Judd and Annie Oakley. Mr. Grant said: ""Anyone can look at a plantation home and say it's important to preserve that. And everybody did. But I think darn few people could look at the most rudimentary, simple, vernacular house and say, 'Those are important and need to be saved.' And nobody did."" Back in the truck, Mr. Grant pointed to a tumbledown shack on the west side of the road. (Preservation plan B? Ruins.) This home last belonged to Crazy Larry, he said. ""It was my grandmother Ruth's sister -- who died in a car wreck -- her husband's second wife's son."" Along with being the keeper of the bulbs and buildings no one else wants to claim, Mr. Grant has become the caretaker of half-forgotten names. He estimates that of the 500 people who once occupied the community of Arcadia, he could classify half as kin. (The current population stands at 57.)

Mr. Grant sometimes applies a country term to his background and pastimes: ""redneck."" Be that as it may, Mr. Grant has also written six books. His latest, ""The Rose Rustlers"" (written with William C. Welch and published last fall by Texas A&M University Press), describes the hunt for lost Southern roses, and the effort to repopularize them in Texas gardens. For a time, Mr. Grant worked with Dr. Welch at the Antique Rose Emporium, near College Station, Tex. This specialty nursery would grow out cuttings discovered by the Rustlers in cemeteries and unkempt yards, then return these robust and fragrant roses to new gardens. A decade later, Mr. Grant established his own heritage farm to spread the hardy but hard-to-find bulbs that he had collected from his neighbors. These tales feed the lectures that Mr. Grant gives to garden clubs. Over the years, he has delivered more than 1,500. ""Every plant has a story,"" Mr. Grant will say. ""If you don't have a story, I will give it a story. 'You bought a plant at Lowe's, you fell and skinned your knee, and the cat peed on it.' That's the story: It starts there.""

This old plant stuff also became the germ plasm that Mr. Grant has tapped to breed and select new ornamentals. The goal: plants that will thrive in Texas and beyond. A well-adapted narcissus, for instance, will bloom beyond a year or two. Twenty is a reasonable minimum; 200 would be better. ""I went to horticulture school to learn to grow things,"" he said. ""And now what I grow is plants that grow without me. I wasted my parents' money."" Mr. Grant has introduced more than 50 cultivars: roses, bluebonnets, mums, phloxes, salvias, verbenas. These plants carry the names of friends, colleagues, grandparents, first ladies (""Laura Bush"" is a disease-resistant petunia) and beloved dogs. Several of his bulletproof best-sellers earned the label ""Texas Superstars,"" a crown in commerce. Jerry M. Parsons, a retired professor of horticulture and an early mentor, said Mr. Grant possesses a matchless eye for color and variations in foliage. ""It's not a trick,"" Dr. Parsons said. ""It's a gift from God, is what it is.""

From Mr. Grant's habit of socializing with elderly gardeners, his mother, Jackie Grant, said, ""I always thought he would marry an old woman."" Not so. The new Mrs. Melanie Grant, 47, first dated Mr. Grant when she was an undergraduate at Louisiana State University. He was a graduate student and the adviser of the horticulture club. A quarter of a century later, she tracked him down, like a lost rose, on his garden blog. ""I Googled Greg,"" Mrs. Grant said. ""He leaves an impression on everyone, not just me."" Mr. Grant said, ""Notice she didn't say 'good impression.' Just 'impression.'""

He continued, ""I was always married to my job, my career in horticulture."" He'd created a homestead tailored perfectly to one (and only one) person. Mr. Grant recalled that people would tell him, ""No woman is going to live in that house with you."" This assessment proved correct. ""She came in and looked at the bedroom and said, 'I'll never spend a night in this house.'"" ""And I didn't,"" Mrs. Grant said. ""I called it 'The Museum.' It was not livable."" ""It didn't have central air and heat,"" Mr. Grant said. Mrs. Grant said, ""In the summer! In Texas!"" Grandma Emanis's old house includes both heat and air now. Cable TV, too. Mr. Grant has turned his novel domestic arrangement into an opportunity to do something quite familiar: that is, overhaul the garden. He compiled an inventory of Mrs. Grant's favorite plants -- a cape jasmine gardenia, sweet olive, daisies, blackberries. Within a couple of months, he'd put them all in the ground. ""I've got to take the house from horse barn to Pottery Barn,"" Mr. Grant said. It'll take a generation or two."

The Buckeyes, 5-0 and ranked fourth, were faced with the prospect of not meeting the six-game threshold to qualify for the Big Ten title game on Dec. 19 after Michigan on Tuesday canceled this weekend's rivalry game between the teams because of a coronavirus outbreak within the program.

Now, after the conference's Administrators Council, which includes athletic directors and senior women administrators, changed the rules and eliminated a minimum-game restriction, Ohio State will face No. 14 Northwestern in Indianapolis for the conference title. The Buckeyes will also have a competitive advantage for that game, with an effective bye this week after the Michigan cancellation, while Northwestern plays Illinois on Saturday.

The conference said in a statement that the decision was based on ""a competitive analysis,"" because even if Ohio State had lost to Michigan it would have still finished ahead of Indiana, the second-place team in the conference, whose one loss in seven games came to Ohio State, 42-35, on Nov. 21."

If there were ever sentient beings in the Ophiuchus cluster, a faraway conglomeration of galaxies in the southern sky, they are long gone. A few hundred million years ago, a mighty cosmic storm swept through that region of space. Hot gas suffuses the cluster, but the storm blew a crater through it more than a million light-years wide, leaving just a near-vacuum, a nattering haze of ultrahot electrical particles. The culprit, astronomers suspect, was a gigantic outburst of energy from a supermassive black hole -- the biggest explosion ever documented in the universe, according to Simona Giacintucci, a radio astronomer at the Naval Research Laboratory and the leader of the research team. In a statement issued by the lab on Feb. 27, Dr. Giacintucci compared the effects of the explosion to the eruption in 1980 that ripped the top from Mount St. Helens in Washington. Except that ""you could fit 15 Milky Way galaxies in a row"" into the crater punched out of the gas by this eruption, she said. The latest radio observations of the galaxy cluster were described in a paper in the Astrophysical Journal.

The alleged outburst would rank as the biggest explosion yet discovered in the history of the universe: the energetic equivalent of one billion supernova explosions, unleashed in a torrent that probably lasted 100 million years. A hundred million years of bad space weather. That is extreme, but it may not be the worst scenario. Ophiuchus is relatively close to Earth, only about 390 million light-years away. If astronomers look farther afield, they might see evidence of equally outlandish events, said Norbert Werner, an astronomer at Masaryk University in Brno in the Czech Republic and at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, whose observations with NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory helped lead to the discovery. A black hole with several billion times the mass of the sun presumably squats at the center of the Ophiuchus cluster, in a galaxy known only by a number, WISEA J171227.81-232210.7. Black holes are best known for their ability to swallow matter and energy, including light, and remove it from the universe forever. But they have another trait: They belch, and when a black hole belches, you don't want to be anywhere nearby. Paradoxically, belching black holes are the brightest objects in the universe, producing the fireworks known as quasars and other violent phenomena. Galaxy clusters are the largest conglomerations of matter in the universe, containing the equivalent of trillions of suns. But most of that matter is in the form of intergalactic gas so hot that it radiates X-rays, which astronomers use to spot clusters far out in space. When this gas cools and sinks to the center of the galaxy, it provides the fuel for outbursts by which a supermassive black hole can affect realms of the cosmos far beyond the originating galaxy.

On the way to disappearing, the gas swirls around the edge of the black hole like water around a drain. Pressures in this doughnut of doom squeeze powerful jets of particles and radiation out the top and bottom of the disk, fire-hosing the universe. In 2003, observations with the Chandra satellite found that regular pulsations of a giant black hole in a galaxy in the Perseus cluster of galaxies were generating waves across intergalactic space with the frequency of a B-flat 57 octaves below middle C. The black hole was ""singing."" By blowing periodic bubbles in the gas around it, the black hole was preventing stars from forming. Other singing black holes were subsequently found. In 2016, a sharp discontinuity appeared in Chandra's X-ray maps of the Ophiuchus cluster. Dr. Werner, then at Stanford, wondered if it represented the edge of another black hole bubble. He and his colleagues ultimately concluded that it was not, ""because it would have to be the result of the most powerful outburst that we have ever seen in the universe,"" he wrote in an email. But Dr. Giacintucci and her colleagues persisted. They examined data from the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton X-ray satellite, which also revealed an ""edge,"" and from a pair of radio telescopes: the Murchison Widefield Array in Australia and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in India. The radio telescopes clinched the case. The region lacking X-rays on the other side of the ""edge"" was full of radio noise, exactly as expected if a beam of powerful high-energy particles had blasted that region clean. ""The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove,"" said Maxim Markevitch of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and a member of Dr. Giacintucci's team. Dr. Werner said that the black hole would have had to swallow about 270 million solar masses of material to have created such a big blast. The storm could have raged for 100 million years. It takes a long time to digest a small galaxy worth of suns."

60838,A Designer Who Makes Impalas Do the Limbo,"Marvin Shivnarain's 1964 Impala SS, with hydraulics and some added chrome, is relatively tame by lowrider standards.","SCRAPE Marvin Shivnarain with his wife, Marsha, and son, Jayden, in their 1964 Chevrolet Impala SS lowrider.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/02/automobiles/02EGO-span/02EGO-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=221&w=600&s=2f34592c47837523ef4b0831d2fab9e446eb920d27df76aa8b4795d5bffff948&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/automobiles/collectibles/02EGO.html,7c820032-8358-5bd6-adea-5b291c3a10bf.jpg,"MARVIN SHIVNARAIN, a 39-year-old graphic designer, opened the trunk of his 1964 Chevrolet Impala SS to reveal six large car batteries strapped in a line and four golden hydraulic pumps that shone in the afternoon sun. ""Each one of these pumps goes to a cylinder on each corner of the car,"" Mr. Shivnarain said, describing the mechanism that makes the chassis of his Chevy, a lowrider, rise when the hydraulic cylinders extend and drop down when the pressure is relieved. At the moment, the Impala was bottomed out, whiskers off the ground. ""That's a lot of power,"" he said, referring to the batteries that provide electricity for the hydraulic pumps. ""It's very easy to burn through metal and to cause a giant fire by just touching the wrong wire with the wrong metal."" ""There've been mishaps,"" he said. Mr. Shivnarain recalled the first time he installed hydraulics, in a Ford Thunderbird during the early 1990s. He had not reinforced the sheet metal where the cylinders attached. A cylinder shot through the car -- the lowrider equivalent of slipping on a banana peel -- leaving him stranded in Manhattan.

""Just stuck there for hours and hours,"" he said, shrugging. ""You can't tow it -- it's too low. Basically, I almost dragged the car home."" Mr. Shivnarain was goaded into reliving those trying times one recent afternoon. He was wearing a blue T-shirt and jeans, and hosing down the Impala behind his house in this quiet Long Island suburb -- an unlikely place to find a lowrider, much less a garage like Mr. Shivnarain's. The garage is tall and white with an overhang on one side that shelters a vehicle lift. One of the two big barn doors was open wide. Spray nozzles for his airbrush gear and canisters of paint lined the door's shelves. Mr. Shivnarain was a teenager, living in nearby Hempstead, when he began airbrush painting on jeans and T-shirts. One day, a close friend hired him to do airbrush work on his 5-liter Mustang. ""I was a little afraid of it,"" Mr. Shivnarain remembered. ""And he's like, 'What's the worst that can happen? If it doesn't come out good, we'll sand it off and I'll get it repainted. But if it works out good, I'll give you 200 bucks.'""

Just like that, a career was born. Lowrider Impalas were the music video car of choice for rappers tall (Snoop Dogg) and small (Skee-Lo). Before he bought the silver '64 Impala SS convertible he was washing, Mr. Shivnarain owned a standard 1964 convertible, which he sold to a man in Australia. ""He owned a limousine business,"" Mr. Shivnarain said. ""And he said they loved the lowriders out there. They were booking it left and right for weddings and all kinds of things."" Mr. Shivnarain remembered the car fondly. ""It was all built up,"" he said. ""It had hydraulics, candy green paint -- a nice looking car. But it wasn't an SS, you know?"" The SS -- the abbreviation for Super Sport -- was the top level of trim for Impalas. His current car is relatively tame by lowrider standards. It has hydraulics; the instruments have been replaced by a row of electronic readouts. But it lacks the dazzling finish of his previous car. There is some rust along the edges. Mr. Shivnarain plans to give the Impala the full lowrider treatment. But, he said, he has too many customer cars awaiting paint to work on his own. Mr. Shivnarain has also cut back the amount of time he spends doing airbrush graphics, a change necessitated by the pain lingering from an assault about six years ago. Leaving a restaurant in Hempstead with his brother and some friends, he said, two men approached; one pointed a gun at Mr. Shivnarain's head. He managed to bat down the assailant's arm, but the gun went off and Mr. Shivnarain was hit in the side. His brother and a friend were also shot. The three men recovered from their wounds, but Mr. Shivnarain said there was still a bullet lodged close to his spine, and it becomes painful if he's on his feet for too long. Now he does more of his design work at the computer -- his company is called Artist Technicians -- and spends less time doing custom paint for customers.

His 2-year-old son, Jayden, ran around the backyard, stopping every once in a while to dip a blade of grass into the soapy water. Mr. Shivnarain spoke about California, the epicenter of the lowrider culture, which can be traced to the 1940s. ""When I'm out there, it's like a history lesson,"" he said. ""I'll be with guys all the way down in San Diego and up to Montclair. They all have different stories of what a lowrider is to them. I'll reach out to the older lowriders, and they have some of the best stories from the '70s and '60s."" ""When we started out in 1992, there were no lowrider shops anywhere in the five boroughs,"" Mr. Shivnarain said. Hence, the catastrophes. In 1994, when Mr. Shivnarain and his friend Kenneth Joseph, known as Bean, started the Drastic Auto Club for lowriders, they contacted Mario De Alba Jr., who opened Mario's Auto Works in Montclair, Calif., with his father Mario Sr., in 1986. ""They were superstars,"" Mr. Shivnarain said, before correcting himself. ""They are superstars."" Three other De Alba brothers (Albert, Greg and Adrian) also work at the shop, as does Albert's son, Albert Jr. ""And that's what's so cool about California, they learn right from their father, they learn right from their grandfather,"" Mr. Shivnarain said. ""They're learning the right way."" Eventually, Mr. Shivnarain and the other members of his car club acquired the skills needed to build a proper lowrider, including audio-video installation, body repair and hydraulic systems."

""It is still a great orchestra, but there is somebody sleeping next to you and making little snores. That is what the string beans are."" Mr. Paradiso, 72, has been the head of the New York SoHo chapter of the Accademia Italiana della Cucina, the Italian Academy of Cuisine, for more than a decade. He addressed his criticism to 30 or so Accademia members (""accademici,"" so designated by demure green, red and white pins affixed to their lapels, which differ in design according to rank) and their guests, who gather each month to review an Italian restaurant. For the 66th anniversary of the Accademia this summer, they dined at Osteria 57, a pescatarian restaurant in Greenwich Village.

Members, who need not have any culinary training or experience, assess each dish not only for its gastronomic merit, but also for the food's adherence to what they regard as the authentic cooking of Italy -- the motherland, for some, the grandmotherland, for others. ""Many restaurants that call themselves Italian -- they do not create real Italian food,"" said Mr. Paradiso, a businessman and engineer who lives in Great Neck, N.Y., and left Italy in his late 20s. ""If somebody doesn't know the difference between good and not good, he thinks it is the real Italian cuisine. That's where we intervene. We protect against the imitations. "" Francesco Genuardi, the consul general of Italy in New York, said the accademici ""focus on Italian cuisine as an essential part of our culture. It's not just a colorful part of our life, but a part of our tradition, our history, our economy."" Despite its international reach -- 7,800 members in more than 40 countries -- the Accademia is only one of many culinary organizations in Italy.

""The reputation of them in Italy is, I would say, next to zero,"" said the food writer Elizabeth Minchilli, the author of ""The Italian Table,"" who has lived in Rome for more than three decades. ""It seems like an expat type of thing. I have never, ever, ever heard of them."" Founded by Milanese intellectuals in 1953, the group was recognized as a cultural institution by the Italian government in 2003. This is not unusual in Italy: A consortium founded in 1934 vouches for authentic Parmesan, and a nonprofit association founded in 1984 safeguards Neapolitan pizza. When the Accademia started, ""it was a fantastic operation,"" said Laura Lazzaroni, the editor in chief of Food & Wine Italia. ""It was the result of a group of very smart people from the arts, literature and journalism, who had a sincere love and appreciation for food, and knew food."" But today, she said, ""It's not something that people are aware of that much anymore."" The SoHo accademici take their work seriously. Each pays $250 in annual dues, as well as the cost of dinners.

They see themselves as guardians of Italian cuisine as it splinters to adapt to tastes abroad. Mr. Paradiso, who is also a lifetime member of the Accademia's board in Italy, says Italian restaurants in the United States can be divided into three categories: the real thing; Italian-American restaurants, where the cuisine comes from ancestral family memories; and imitation Italian places, the lowest rung. Many lovers of Italian food would strongly disagree with Mr. Paradiso's taxonomy. But over the course of the anniversary dinner, several accademici insisted that New York has only a handful of true Italian restaurants. Il Gattopardo, an 18-year-old restaurant across West 54th Street from the Museum of Modern Art, is a clear favorite; they awarded it an eight on their scale of five to nine, modeled after the grading system in Italian public schools.

They also awarded an eight to San Carlo Osteria Piemonte in SoHo, to 10 Corso Como in the seaport district and to Via Vai Astoria in Queens, among others. They have never given a restaurant a nine. ""It is very difficult to reach the sublime moment of having a dish, or a meal, that puts you in a different level,"" said Mr. Paradiso, who recalled that the only time he personally gave a nine was after he ate a lobster in Italy ; he nearly wept as he chewed. ""A nine requires many, many things that I don't think you can find in the United States."" Every chapter is led by a ""delegato"" like Mr. Paradiso. The SoHo group, which Mr. Paradiso opened with the blessing of headquarters in 2005, has 36 members. The other local delegation, simply called the New York chapter, started meeting in the 1950s and has 34 members. Some attendees were from the New Jersey chapter, and accademici meet regularly in Boston, Houston, San Francisco and several other U.S. cities. The SoHo chapter does not review New York's many red-sauce Italian-American restaurants. ""For us, an Italian-American restaurant is a foreign restaurant. It is a different cuisine,"" Mr. Paradiso said. That style derives from the era when Italian immigrants, coming from scarcity, turned to the abundant cheap cuts of meat in their new country.

""To me, there has to be a feeling of Italy in the dish,"" said Aurelie Paradiso, 42, Mr. Paradiso's daughter, an architect and an accademica . ""It has to remind us of home."" At the end of the nearly three-hour dinner, the chef, Riccardo Orfino, thanked them for attending. Then the accademici gathered up the notes they'd taken. Groups of four or five had given each course a rating, and then rated the restaurant. Ultimately, they awarded Osteria 57 an eight. Excellent, but with a caveat. ""In my opinion, it was very well done,"" Mr. Paradiso said, ""but I would not put the string beans next time."" Mr. Scelsa nodded in agreement, though he had no complaints. ""It's not an Olive Garden,"" he said, pushing back his chair. ""That's for sure."""

A man born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Toronto and schooled at a Yeshiva and a Japanese-American man raised on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, were married in the rare books section of the Strand Bookstore in Greenwich Village before a crowd of 200 people, against a backdrop of an arch of gold balloons that were connected to each other like intertwined units of a necklace chain or the link emoji, in a ceremony led by a Buddhist that included an operatic performance by one friend, the reading of an original poem based on the tweets of Yoko Ono by another, and a lip-synced rendition of Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" by a drag queen dressed in a white fringe jumper and a long veil. The grooms met on the internet. But this isn't a story about people who swiped right. Adam J. Kurtz, 29, and Mitchell Kuga, 30, first connected Dec. 1, 2012, five years to the day before their wedding.

Among those who liked the video was a stranger Mr. Kurtz had already admired from afar. It was a guy named Mitchell who didn't reveal his last name on his Tumblr account, just his photographic eye for Brooklyn street scenes and, on occasion, his face. Mr. Kurtz had developed a bit of a social-media crush on him. ""I would think, 'He's not even sharing his whole life, that is so smart and impressive,'"" Mr. Kurtz said. Mr. Kurtz had learned from following Mitchell's Tumblr posts that the two of them had a mutual friend, a photographer named Paul Mpagi Sepuya. He went to Mr. Sepuya's Facebook page and scrolled through his friends looking for a fellow named Mitchell with dark hair and pierced ears.

Mr. Kurtz found Mitchell Kuga there and messaged him. The gist was, ""My pizza is here. You want some pizza?"" Then he added his cellphone number and immediately logged off Facebook. His hope was that Mr. Kuga would want to respond and that he would have to do so by texting. Mr. Kuga texted Mr. Kurtz five minutes later: ""Hi Adam, this is Mitchell."" Mr. Kuga was about to leave for work, at Momo Sushi Shack in Brooklyn, where he was a waiter. ""Adam said, 'When are you free?'"" Mr. Kuga said. ""I said, 'Next Tuesday.' He said, 'I mean tonight, when are you free tonight?' So I told him I was off at 1 a.m. and he said, 'I'll be there.'""

""We love Mitchell,"" he said to Mr. Kurtz. ""If you break his heart, I will kill you."" They went for drinks at a nearby bar and then went to Mr. Kurtz's apartment, where he had set out slices of pizza. They talked till 7 a.m. They soon began dating, and in the intervening months and years, they traveled to Paris, Brazil, Tokyo, Coney Island. They wrote each other love notes in perfect penmanship. On a birthday card to Mr. Kurtz, Mr. Kuga addressed it to, ""my babe my sun my emoji my rock my lol my jew boo my reason."" When they met, they both were relatively new to New York. Mr. Kuga had moved to the city from Oahu in 2010, after having studied magazine journalism at Syracuse University, from which he graduated in 2009. He is a freelance journalist who has written for Next Magazine and for Gothamist, including an article about Spam (the food product, not the digital menace).

He began to build a large social media following, particularly on Instagram, of those who enjoyed his wry humor in celebrating paper culture through digital media, as well as the witty items he began to sell online (like little heart-shaped Valentine's Day candies that say, ""RT 4 YES, FAV 4 NO"" AND ""REBLOG ME""). In 2014, Penguin Random House published his book ""1 Page at a Time: A Daily Creative Companion,"" which has sold 100,000 copies, his book editor Marian Lizzi said. ""Pick Me Up,"" a journal, was his follow-up in 2016. This year he published ""Things Are What You Make of Them: Life Advice for Creatives."" He has a line of stationery and notebooks through Abrams, and his specialty dining pieces and mugs are sold by Fishs Eddy. He now works full time as an author and artist.

Mr. Kuga also told his sister, Marisa, about Mr. Kurtz. ""It was his way of coming out to me,"" said Ms. Kuga, now 24, while sipping from a beer bottle at her brother's wedding. ""It wasn't a surprise to me that he was gay. But it showed to me how special this is. He finally wanted to put it into words."" It has been a more complicated situation for Mr. Kurtz, who first came out as gay to his parents when he was 15. They handled it as lovingly as a strictly religious family might, he said. Still, it has been tough for all parties to navigate. ""I don't know if they expected me to become a rabbi,"" he said. ""But I don't think they expected me to be gay and marry a Japanese Hawaiian man."" While some gay men and women in long-term relationships felt an overwhelming urge to marry as soon as gay marriage was legalized by the Supreme Court in June 2015, some younger gay couples felt otherwise. Including Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Kuga. ""A lot of us feel like marriage is not that important because it wasn't an option for so long so it isn't a factor that should determine the strength of a commitment,"" Mr. Kurtz said. ""It can be seen as a heteronormative idea."" Mr. Kuga struggled with ambivalence, too, sharing his thoughts in a piece posted to Instagram a week after the wedding. ""Growing up gay on an island during a time when gay marriage wasn't legal, marriage was never for me."" he wrote. ""I wasn't sad about this. If the books I read were any indication, being gay just meant resigning myself to a certain solitude.""

When the men changed their minds about marriage, it was out of pragmatism. It was the summer of 2016, and they were lying in bed talking. ""'I think we deserve the rights and protections that married people are afforded. I want to bury you,'"" Mr. Kurtz recalled saying to Mr. Kuga. (""Romance!"" Mr. Kuga interjected as the men told the story.) From that point on, they considered themselves engaged. A few weeks later they went to Chinatown to buy engagement rings and then posted the news on Instagram to make it real. At first they considered a courthouse wedding or something very small. But then they decided they wanted to host an event that brought together the communities that had helped foster and sustain their relationship. This included the staff of Momo Sushi, Mr. Kurtz's friends from Baltimore, a large contingent of people the couple met through social media and Mr. Kuga's family -- except for his father, who could not fly from Hawaii because of recent surgery.

The grooms kept the cost to about $10,000, and did so in part by relying on the Instagram barter economy. (For example, there was a photo-booth-like machine that a company provided to the couple free of charge, in exchange for a promotional post on Mr. Kurtz's Instagram feed.) After a cocktail reception, the grooms emerged, both dressed in black and wearing leis that Amy Kuga had brought from Hawaii. They were married by Hector Marcel, a Buddhist teacher and Universal Life minister. He asked all in attendance to tie red strings around one another's wrists in acknowledgment of their role in making and supporting the marriage.

""You are getting married to each other,"" he said to the crowd, before asking the men to read aloud the vows they had written. (Mr. Kurtz wrote his in crayon.) Mr. Kurtz, who is 6-foot-2, and Mr. Kuga, who is 5-foot-7, never let their eyes unlock. ""I love this wedding,"" said Guan Yang, the boyfriend of Mr. Kurtz's book editor. He nodded toward the chain of linked balloons. ""The amount of irony is just right."" After the ceremony there were toasts, including one that took on the feel of a freestyle poetry jam by Janea Kelly, a longtime friend of Mr. Kurtz's. She thanked the couple for giving the crowd an opportunity to celebrate love at the end of 2017, a year that ""felt like stepping on a Lego in the dark."" But it was Mr. Kuga's mother who returned to the importance of communities, reminding the guests that bonds are created in different ways. ""Adam has always been a part of our family, but now he is officially our son,"" she said looking up at Mr. Kurtz. ""It's only taken 30 years to get a child over 5 feet 8 inches."""
43861,MTV Mines the Past for Its Future: 'Total Request Live',"Remember the ""TRL"" studio and crowds in Times Square? Music? Carson Daly? MTV hopes you do, and will tune in again.","Jennifer Lopez on ""TRL"" with its host, Carson Daly, in 2004.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/31/business/31MTV2/31MTV2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=c83050e0f30cea7130e9b1b85568693a0448982dadebef08abe4c6bf6f431381&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/business/media/mtv-total-request-live-revival.html,cea10065-f91f-5fb9-af8d-e4c3e219a4ad.jpg,"Chris McCarthy, the president of MTV, at the site of the new ""Total Request Live"" studio in Times Square. ""If we're going to come back and reinvent MTV, the studio is a given,"" he said.



On a recent Wednesday afternoon, Chris McCarthy, the newish president of MTV, was standing at a corner of 44th Street and Broadway and gazing up at the second floor of Viacom's Manhattan headquarters. ""When you came into Times Square, you would say, 'Let's go to MTV,'"" he said, recalling a better time when MTV was, well, relevant. Mr. McCarthy, 42, was looking at the space that used to house ""Total Request Live,"" the MTV afternoon show from 1998 to 2008 that helped make the host, Carson Daly, a star and was a must-stop destination for musicians, Times Square gawkers and advertisers eager to reach a young audience. That was then. Ratings at MTV in the last five years have nose-dived, turnaround strategies have failed and the cable network's parent company, Viacom, has watched its stock go into free fall.

So, what's a media executive to do? Mr. McCarthy said ""TRL"" would return in October, and a massive studio facing Times Square was under construction in the hope of capturing the old magic. ""If we're going to come back and reinvent MTV, the studio is a given,"" he said. ""It is the centerpiece."" It is also the centerpiece in what Mr. McCarthy believes is the beginning of MTV's comeback. Though many observers say that is a long shot, there have been encouraging signs in recent weeks. Ratings for MTV's core audience -- 18- to 34-year-olds -- went up in June and July, the first time the network has experienced back-to-back months of ratings growth in four years. So far, those gains have come courtesy of re-engineered reality shows like ""Fear Factor"" and ""Wild 'n Out,"" a sketch comedy show.

The latest strategic pivot at MTV is vital to the fortunes of Viacom, which also owns other cable channels like Comedy Central and Nickelodeon. The company, which has experienced a chaotic year and a half, has tried to stabilize itself with a strategy targeting six core cable channels, MTV included. Viacom was also in the hunt to buy Scripps, the company that owns networks like HGTV and Food Network, before pulling out of the negotiations late last week. But no matter what, it's going to be an uphill climb. Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson Research, said MTV had several challenges, including a fickle audience that is preoccupied with social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. ""Looking at it month to month, week to week, you could see some early winds, but there's heavy skepticism of a multiyear recovery,"" he said. Mr. McCarthy, who oversaw turnaround projects at MTV's sister cable channels VH1, Logo and MTV2, is not lacking in confidence, saying that he and his team have already ""totally turned the business around after five years of decline.""

""I see that math, I see the shows we are about to green-light, I see that landscape for the next few months -- we're stable,"" he said. ""How do I know that? I could be wrong, but I haven't missed an estimate in the 12 years I've been doing TV."" Robert Bakish, Viacom's chief executive, said he was heartened by MTV's recent results and credited Mr. McCarthy, who took over in late 2016. ""When Chris got in, he analyzed the situation, we talked about it and he quickly arrived at the conclusion that the programming direction was wrong,"" Mr. Bakish said. ""He reset the brand filter, cleaned out the pipeline and began building a new MTV that's much more based on reality, unscripted and music content."" There have been many strategic shifts at the network in the last five years: heavy investments in scripted programming, a hiring spree for MTV News, and a seemingly endless stream of dark and dreary reality series. When Mr. McCarthy came aboard, he quickly killed more than 100 projects in development. He regarded the decision in 2015 to pour resources into MTV News -- which hired, among others, several prominent journalists from Bill Simmons's old website, Grantland -- as misaligned with the network's mission and pulled the plug. ""MTV at its best -- whether it's news, whether it's a show, whether it's a docu-series -- is about amplifying young people's voices,"" he said. ""We put young people on the screen, and we let the world hear their voices. We shouldn't be writing 6,000-word articles on telling people how to feel.""

Charlie Walk, the president of Republic Records, which has musicians like Drake and Lorde on its talent roster, said that in recent years MTV had abandoned the music business and that bringing ""TRL"" back was a big step in the right direction. ""Who's not going to support a platform that's covering all of the buckets of social media and cable to allow your artist to go on, play a video, perform a song and to talk about their new music that just got released?"" he said. ""How do you say no to that? We're going to give it a shot, a big shot."" There will be plenty, of course, who roll their eyes. ""It's the right route,"" he said. ""When you talk to artists and they say to you, unaware of what we're doing, can you bring back 'TRL'? We'd be crazy not to reinvent that."" ""MTV's reinvention,"" he continued, ""is coming by harnessing its heritage."" At least, that's the latest game plan."

The inquiry concerns Uber's use of a software tool called Greyball, which the company developed in part to aid entrance into new markets where its service was not permitted. The tool allowed Uber to deploy what was essentially a fake version of its app to evade law enforcement agencies that were cracking down on its service.

The New York Times reported on Greyball in March, raising questions about the legality of the practice. After the report, Uber said it would prohibit employees from using the software to thwart regulators.

The federal inquiry was disclosed in a transportation audit conducted by the City of Portland, Ore., published last week. In the audit, Portland officials said they had been notified by the United States attorney's office for the Northern District of California about the existence of the inquiry. The City of Portland said it was cooperating with the inquiry."
21777,"The Making of '1984,' George Orwell's Nightmare Vision of a World Without Truth","""The Ministry of Truth,"" by Dorian Lynskey, is a ""biography"" of the 1949 novel, an enduring icon of state power devoid of moral principle and human concern.","A poster for the 1956 movie version of ""1984.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/21/books/review/21Mendes/Mendes1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=269&w=513&s=8abcc76556adf712136aeb2f839eebb32a9ada0433fb3bd4fef2c3203a1dd8eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/books/review/dorian-lynskey-ministry-of-truth-1984.html,793eff8b-202a-53b5-8773-92cf9bbf686a.jpg,"Lynskey focuses much of his book on the origins and the afterlife of ""1984."" He devotes several early chapters to the rise of utopian and dystopian fiction, told through compressed portraits of figures like H. G. Wells (who ""loomed over Orwell's childhood like a planet"") and Yevgeny Zamyatin, the author of ""We"" -- a sort of precursor to ""1984."" And he documents the various political and cultural responses to the novel, which was a sensation from its first publication.

""1984"" has inspired writers, artists and other creative types, from Margaret Atwood to David Bowie to Steve Jobs, whose commercial introducing Apple's Macintosh computer famously paid homage to the novel. Its political fate, however, has been somewhat cloudier. What Orwell observed of Dickens, that he is ""one of those writers who are well worth stealing,"" has proved no less true of Orwell himself. Socialists, libertarians, liberals and conservatives alike have vied to remake him in their own image and claim his authority. Orwell's contested legacy may be rooted partly in his self-divisions. He was a socialist intellectual who hated socialists and intellectuals; an alienated soul who ""lionized the common man,"" as Lynskey puts it. Still, the filial (and often proprietary) attachment that Orwell's work tends to evoke in his admirers points to something else: the morally urgent yet highly companionable nature of his writing, which can leave one with the feeling of having been directly addressed by a mind worthy of emulation.

Lynskey largely refrains from participating in the quarrel over Orwell's and his novel's true teachings and rightful heirs. If anything, ""The Ministry of Truth"" can seem too remote at times from its subject matter. For a ""biography"" of ""1984,"" it contains surprisingly little sustained discussion of the work itself, mostly referring to it in brief, though insightful, asides that are dispersed throughout. There could have been more in-depth analysis of the dynamics of power in Orwell's totalitarian state, whose leaders, we are told, are the first to have dispensed with even the pretense of serving humanity. (They pursue power as an end in itself, not as a means to some alleged ideological goal, and exercise it by inflicting pain on others.)

Nor does Lynskey illuminate the literary or intellectual qualities that distinguish Orwell's novel from its many predecessors and descendants in the dystopian genre. In short, while we learn a great deal about the evolution and influence of ""1984"" as a cultural phenomenon, we sometimes lose sight, in the thick of Lynskey's historicizing, of the novel's intrinsic virtues -- of what makes it distinctive and accounts for its terror and fascination in the first place."

He was 68. The death was confirmed by the photographer-owned agency Noor Images, of which Mr. Greene, who lived in Paris, was a founding member. No cause was given, although associates said he had been treated for liver cancer for several years. Mr. Greene was one of the few African-American photographers who worked internationally. He traveled widely, making powerful images of conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq and the republics of Chechnya and Georgia, among other places. Some of his pictures were too raw for many publications.

Mr. Greene's commitment to telling the unvarnished truth extended to his assessments of the ethical questions facing photojournalism. He railed against the use of computer programs like Photoshop to alter the scenes of news images, a practice that he said turned photos into ""cartoons."" And he scorned photographers who staged images in an attempt to recreate a missed moment after arriving late to a news scene. ""We have to be ambassadors of the truth,"" he told Lens in 2015. ""We have to hold ourselves to a higher standard because the public no longer trusts the media. We are considered merchants of misery and therefore get a bad rap."" Mr. Greene had once aspired to be a painter, like Matisse, or a musician, like Jimi Hendrix, but he discovered his true instrument the first time he picked up a camera, he told Michael Kamber in the 2010 Lens interview. Mr. Kamber, a former conflict photographer himself and the author of ""Photojournalists on War: The Untold Stories From Iraq,"" compared Mr. Greene to a jazz musician. ""Stanley is like the Charles Mingus of photography,"" Mr. Kamber, the founder of the Bronx Documentary Center, said in an interview. ""Stanley is about his heart, his emotions and his feelings. His photos are very impressionistic, like a stream of consciousness.""

""He was one of those journalists who went toward the bullet,"" Ms. Tucker said, ""because that's where the story was."" Stanley Greene was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 14, 1949, and grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y. His father, also named Stanley, was an actor, producer, filmmaker and director; his mother, Javotee Sutton Greene, was an actress. His father, an activist devoted to black culture, was blacklisted as a Communist in the 1950s and was reduced to taking anonymous bit parts. Information on survivors was not immediately available. The younger Mr. Greene had a ""somewhat privileged yet traumatic childhood,"" his longtime friend Jules Allen said. ""There was a loneliness there that was insatiable, but he was blessed enough to at least partially deal with his pain through photography."" As a teenager, Mr. Greene joined the Black Panthers and was active in the antiwar movement. His dreams of becoming a painter gave way to photography, and he was encouraged in that pursuit by the renowned photojournalist W. Eugene Smith. In the 1970s, Mr. Allen and Mr. Greene shared a darkroom and a studio in San Francisco while Mr. Greene studied photography at the San Francisco Art Institute. Some of his early work was published in ""The Western Front,"" a book that chronicled the city's punk music scene in the 1970s and '80s.

He cut as striking a figure as some of the musicians he photographed. ""Stanley was a punk rocker who drove a Mustang,"" Mr. Allen said. ""He wore a black leather motorcycle jacket, a black beret, two scarves, three watches and four bracelets, as well as two great cameras and a bandoleer of film strapped across his chest."" Mr. Greene worked as a fashion photographer in the 1980s and moved to Paris, where he later joined the Vu photo agency. He worked extensively in Africa and the former Soviet Union. He was the only Western photographer in Russia's White House in 1993 during an attempted coup against the president, Boris Yeltsin. Trapped inside, amid shelling and gunfire, Mr. Greene continued to take photographs throughout the building, capturing two images that received World Press Photo awards. ""The fact that I thought I was going to die gave me courage,"" he wrote in ""Black Passport."" ""Courage is control of fear. I think that this incident is the one that steeled me. I'm no hero, but it made me so that once I commit to a story, I have to see it through."" A 1992 Moscow encounter with Kadir van Lohuizen, a fellow member of Vu, began a close friendship that would lead to their founding Noor Images, a collective of photojournalists, in Amsterdam. Given the emotional toll and the physical dangers of his work, Mr. Greene discouraged others from following in his footsteps.

""Though I'm bombarded by young photographers who ask me how to become a conflict photographer, I tell them, 'Get a life,'"" he wrote in ""Black Passport."" ""If they persist, I tell them about the consequences. I tell them there is no glory."" Even as his health was failing, Mr. Greene continued to work. He returned last month from a road trip through northern Russia, where he and Maria Turchenkova began a project on the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution. At the end of ""Black Passport,"" Mr. Greene reflected on the centrality of storytelling to the human experience. Wars are fought, he said, because people have different views of the same story. ""Photography is my language, and it gives me the power to tell what otherwise is not told,"" he said. ""Eugene Smith told me vision is a gift, and you have to give something back. He haunts me like that. It's not the bang-bang that compels me. It never was. At the end of the day, it is not about death; it is about life. ""The quest is to try to understand why human beings behave the way they do,"" he continued. ""The question is, How does this happen? And sometimes, the only way to find out is to go to where it is happening. One day the neighbors are talking to each other over the fence, and the next they are shooting at each other. Why is it that we don't consider life precious, and instead we literally let it drip through our fingers?"""

Isabelle Huppert: 'The Best Way to Please Is Not to Please'



BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- As she made for her booth, tucked into a remote corner of the Blvd Lounge at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel here, Isabelle Huppert expertly dodged the furtive stares of a roomful of diners. She had arrived on the arm of her publicist, who vanished as discreetly as he had arrived, leaving Ms. Huppert on her own to sit with a reporter, sip her cappuccino and ponder a question: Is she vain? Brusquely, she picked up a knife, inspecting her reflection in its blade. ""Is this what you mean?"" she asked lightly, brushing aside a stray wisp of hair. Was she being coy? Hard to say. Ambiguity, after all, is Ms. Huppert's stock in trade. It is part of the screen arsenal she has deployed in more than 100 films during the course of a four-decade career, and it is central to her role in ""Elle,"" a French-language psychological thriller in which she, as the victim of a vicious rape, responds with an eerie admixture of horror and calm. Her performance, which earned her a best actress award at the Golden Globes in January, drew fresh waves of attention when she was nominated this month for an Academy Award, an honor she seems to regard with a mix of anxiety and cool entitlement.

Would she bring home Oscar gold on Sunday night? ""Yeah, it's possible,"" she ventured, adding definitively after a pause, ""Yes, for me it's time."" That near boast, tempered by a flicker of amusement, hinted at the wickedly subversive streak that has made Ms. Huppert a muse to an international roster of directors, including Claude Chabrol, Otto Preminger, Bertrand Tavernier and Paul Verhoeven. Mr. Verhoeven, of ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Showgirls"" notoriety, directed Ms. Huppert in ""Elle."" Combined with an apparently uncontrived chic, that subversiveness has lately transformed Ms. Huppert, who is mostly known in the United States to an art house crowd, into a red carpet diva and the unlikely darling of the fashion set.

Never mind that Ms. Huppert, 63, long married and the mother of three, plays a grandmother in ""Elle."" Or that in her native Paris she has long been a front-row fixture at Dior, Chanel and Armani. When the cameras closed in on her as she claimed her Globe, writers breathlessly anatomized every facet of her look. As the popular Who What Wear website effusively reported, ""Her incredibly chic midriff-baring top and skirt along with an earful of edgy Repossi ear cuffs have landed the actress on a number of best dressed lists and left the internet buzzing."" The Fashion Law, another widely read blog, posted, ""It is difficult not to notice that Huppert is becoming a favorite not only of critics and fashion industry insiders but of those on the periphery, as well.""

Adding her voice to the mix, Vanessa Friedman, the New York Times fashion critic, posted on Twitter on the night of the Globes, ""Whoever made Isabelle Huppert's dress should take credit ASAP."" Ms. Huppert had selected that dress, Armani Prive, with care. ""It's important how personal and singular you feel in what you wear,"" she said. ""It's important that you keep your own identity."" Would she turn up again in Armani on Oscar night? ""I might,"" she offered playfully. Whether she is captured on camera in a cream-colored trouser suit, as she was at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards in January; in a full-sleeve high-neck Chloe gown at the British Academy Film Awards this month; or in a pale blue trouser suit, snapped alongside Nicole Kidman on the day they received their Oscar nominations, Ms. Huppert projects a singular authority. ""She has what the French used to call chien,"" said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York. He was alluding to the blend of tough chic and barely concealed sensuality that, Mr. Doonan maintains, defines Ms. Huppert's allure. And in viewing her image on Instagram, Ryan Lobo, a designer of the New York label Tome, responded with a single word: ""Queen."" On Instagram, Ms. Huppert is followed by no less a fashion personage than Nicolas Ghesquiere, the creative director of Louis Vuitton.

Still, the style world's renewed devotion has left Ms. Huppert nonplused. ""After all,"" she said, a bit disingenuously, ""I'm not a fashion person."" She had dressed for breakfast at the Beverly Wilshire in a crisply tailored jacket, its deep green and coral pattern setting off her shoulder-length russet hair. Who designed the jacket? Her features furrowed briefly as she removed it to check the label, exclaiming with what seemed genuine surprise: ""It's J. Crew. Can you imagine?"" The jacket, which she wore over a pale coral Chloe blouse and slim trousers, was consistent with a style Ms. Huppert has refined over time, a look that is mostly defined by slim trousers, tailored jackets and coats, understated evening wear, and the occasional provocative accent (those tiny Repossi cuffs snaking up her ear). Immaculately assembled as they may be, her ensembles are ""worn with the effortlessness that Frenchwomen seem to naturally possess,"" Allyson Payer of Who What Wear posted. It is the kind of assessment that Ms. Huppert is apt to greet with one of her ironic smiles. ""Because I'm French, people have a certain idea of my style,"" she said. ""I'm not quite sure what that means. And not quite sure what it is that I'm supposed to represent.""

There are times, it seems, when Ms. Huppert is all potential, her aloof, sometimes opaque, expression -- ""resting bitch face,"" as the fashion tribes would have it -- acting as a potent draw. ""It's intrinsic to her, that certain enigmatic je ne sais quoi,"" Mr. Doonan said. If her mystery tends to mesmerize devout fashionistas, it's not for the first time. Ms. Huppert herself is well aware that she has long fascinated fashion photographers, among them Richard Avedon, Guy Bourdin, Helmut Newton, Hedi Slimane and their illustrious like. ""Her face is like a window, it's so transparent,"" said Peter Lindbergh, who has shot her many times. ""When you photograph people, often that window is closed. Some people let you in, but there is a limit. But Isabelle, she is like glass."" She also has a chameleonlike quality that was captured in 2005 in a show of her portraits at MoMA PS1, subsequently gathered in book form, that volume, like the show, aptly titled, ""Isabelle Huppert: Woman of Many Faces."" Perhaps most famously, she posed, freckle-faced, for Newton wearing a white bathrobe that opened to expose a sliver of nipple, her expression in that instant a disconcerting blend of innocence and insolence.

Nor does she, in her acting, make an effort to seduce. ""I'm not really interested in pleasing,"" she said in her teasing contralto. ""I think the best way to please is not to please."" That refusal is one source of a sexual charisma that can defy analysis. ""I don't use the usual seductive tools,"" Ms. Huppert said. ""My sexuality is almost cerebral. It's never, 'Look at me, see how sexy I am.'"" On the screen she is permitted an erotic latitude not generally available to her contemporaries, in particular Meryl Streep, with whom she is often, if misguidedly, compared. As Michele in ""Elle,"" Ms. Huppert pursues her own sexual agenda, whatever the cost. In a recent fashion feature in The Reporter, she comes off as a steamy, self-obsessed vixen, aptly costumed in form-fitting black leather. She is also permitted a display of self-possession that doesn't quite square with the sexual hunger she is sometimes asked to portray on film. Some call it coldness -- a Brechtian detachment, as Mr. Verhoeven remarked -- or a chilly reflection of self-regard. Does that translate to vanity? Ms. Huppert wondered, returning to a topic that she clearly finds absorbing. ""If it does, I don't care."""

36321,'Ohio' as the Locus of 21st-Century Rust Belt Despair,"In Stephen Markley's debut novel, former classmates reunite to witness the toll contemporary American realities have taken on them all.",Stephen Markley,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/30/books/review/30Chaon1/30Chaon1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=335&w=640&s=8afe35d7dbdeaa03b3296de208b10d0501e1bf54f261e4a9c479b08cd50a8705&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/books/review/stephen-markley-ohio.html,2cd43502-dfcb-5081-9c7a-6ec3c24b37df.jpg,"Graduates' young heads are full of anticipation: What will we become? How will our friends turn out? Will we be the voice of our generation? It may be that our imaginations burn brightest at these gateway junctures, latching onto ideas about ourselves that prove difficult to ever let loose.

So, naturally, a class reunion is an irresistibly juicy narrative device for writers. The trope can take many forms, whether set at an actual alumni gathering, as in Mary Higgins Clark's ""Nighttime Is My Time""; or applied more loosely, as in Hanya Yanagihara's ensemble bildungsroman ""A Little Life."" Still, the cruel pleasures are the same: We get to see how those teenage hopes have played out in adulthood.

For the characters in 's first novel, ""Ohio,"" the future has not exactly gone according to plan. Set in the imaginary Ohio town of New Canaan -- which serves as a microcosm for all that has gone wrong with Middle America this century -- the story focuses on 10 members of the high school class of 2003 whose youthful friendships and various romantic entanglements still haunt them a decade later. Once they were the popular kids, celebrities of their small-town Rust Belt universe, but time has not been kind to them as they close in on their 30s, and in fact a few of them haven't survived to see 29.

The book begins with the funeral of a former football hero and soldier killed in Iraq. Shortly thereafter, another in the group dies of a drug overdose in Los Angeles, and the remaining eight either drift apart or lose touch altogether. But one night in the summer of 2013 the surviving members of the clique come together again, by sheer coincidence, back in New Canaan. The crew satisfies all the American High School Archetypes we know so well: the boorish football jock, the conniving mean girl, the smarmy prepster, the Christian athlete who discovers she might be gay, the opinionated jackass, the innocent, puzzled beauty. But they are never simply stereotypes."

When I arrived here last week, my Airbnb host warned, ""If it's hot outside, it will be even hotter inside."" Imagine, then, what it's like to be in the orchestra pit. Some of Wagner's operas -- his 10 major works are the only ones presented by the 142-year-old Bayreuth Festival -- run well beyond four hours. But the pit is cradled under the stage, virtually hidden from view. So conductors can get away with a lax dress code. ""I wear jeans and a T-shirt, maybe a polo, and I change every act,"" Christian Thielemann, the festival's 59-year-old music director, said in a phone interview before a performance of ""Lohengrin"" this week. For curtain calls, he quickly changes into what he calls his ""Mao suit,"" sweats through that, then escapes offstage for a cognac or whiskey and a shower. ""It's good that you don't see everything that happens here,"" he said with a laugh. ""It's funny, very human.""

Mr. Thielemann is something of a rarity, a conductor who has thrived -- so much so that his title, music director, is more or less unprecedented -- at a festival that is known to challenge even the most established maestros. The design of that sunken pit is the problem: Its idiosyncratic design makes for awkward delays as sound travels to and from the stage, and to the audience in the theater. Some guests never return after one season. But when the pieces of this aural puzzle fit together, the results are magical. Sound emerges from the pit perfectly balanced with the chorus and soloists, as if the performance were being edited in a recording studio and broadcast in real time. Mr. Thielemann's ""Lohengrin"" Prelude enveloped the house with a mysterious, sublime shimmer. ""When I need my Bayreuth ears, I have to cut my normal ears off, and then someone puts the new ears on,"" said Mr. Thielemann, who tends to speak poetically. ""At the end of the summer, the new ears are cut off, and then I have my old ears back."" For all his artistry, Mr. Thielemann approaches his work with a craftsman's care. Indeed, he's even a bit old-fashioned and regularly praises the traditional role of the Kapellmeister in German churches and theaters. His beliefs have also earned him a reputation as a conservative, even far-right, sympathizer.

Fair enough: It was after 3:30 p.m., and the curtain at Bayreuth is a strict 4 o'clock. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How do you change your conducting for Bayreuth? The sound is so different that you have to do certain things like a mechanic: You close a window here and you open another there, or you need some more hot water or cold water. It's kind of like an electrician or plumber, how you try to get the right mixture of sound. It's very much a Kapellmeister task. I know that in the English-speaking world, the word Kapellmeister has not a good sound: boring, uninspired conducting. But when you have these skills, the conducting becomes second nature, and then you can make your art. Where do you see yourself in the tradition of Bayreuth conductors? I have my own point of view, but yes, I think the traditional Kapellmeister tradition has been good for Bayreuth. If you see all the great conductors, they were Kapellmeisters: Karajan, Knappertsbusch and Furtwangler. They were successful here, but you will see they had this typical Kapellmeister career. What is your philosophy for hiring singers? I like singers who do not bark too much. It's strange, but the singers who give too much voice are not good for Bayreuth. And everyone, even famous singers, have to make an audition. It's not really an audition for the opera, but for the house. The house lives; I try to explain to them that the house is living as an animal. The house, like a dog, wants to sniff a little bit and see if you are nice to him. Not everyone wants to do it. Right-wing politicians have criticized theaters for taking stances on political issues and the refugee crisis. Where do you think the Bayreuth Festival does or should fit into this?

Don't forget Bayreuth is a provincial city. It is famous because the sister of Frederick the Great and Wagner, but it is very calm and in a good way provincial. I find the mentality is very laid back. You can see how because so many people are overweight: They love eating and drinking wonderful beers. It's very different from Berlin and the bigger cities, so the political earthquakes are far away. But there were protesters and counterprotesters at the opening night of ""Lohengrin"" as politicians walked the red carpet. They are carried out here just to appear on television. Don't misunderstand that. I don't know that they were really from Bayreuth. Protesters and politicians come, and you can write something for the newspaper, but one day after, everything is gone. It is a storm in a glass of water. Regardless, what should a theater's role be in engaging with politics? My opinion is that I'm a little bit overfed with politics in a theater. I think you should say something, but you also allow for other opinions. You have to have respect for even people you don't respect. So you think liberal theaters should make room for conservative opinions? Well, you are doing something wrong if your view harms another person. Certain opinions are for a good reason forbidden. That's when you're going too far. You know, if you say racist opinions or whatever. There are certain things that are forbidden. They are banned. That's very good. But you can still express things which are a bit uncomfortable. You cannot say every opinion; there is a limit, and you have to stop at a certain point. But before we come to that stop, there is so much space left, you see?"
40441,"March's Book Club Pick: 'Exit West,' by Mohsin Hamid","In this novel, refugees flee war and chaos through any door they can find.","Refugees at a transit camp in Idomeni, Greece, October 2015.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/12/books/review/12Nguyen-Cover/12Nguyen-Cover-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a7d9524b872c81fd7dfe467bcc693028aa2f92c323481ab572e04db3c71dee91&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/exit-west-mohsin-hamid.html,3cd2521d-8263-5f74-9341-32c7dbb0372e.jpg,"Hamid's enticing strategy is to foreground the humanity of these young people, whose urbanity, romantic inclinations, upwardly mobile aspirations and connectedness through social media and smartphones mark them as ""normal"" relative to the novel's likely readers. At the same time, he insists on their ""difference"" from readers who may be Western. Their city is besieged by militants who commit terrible atrocities, evoking scenes from Mosul or Aleppo. As for Nadia, she was ""always clad from the tips of her toes to the bottom of her jugular notch in a flowing black robe."" But while this robe seems to be a form of conservative Islamic dress, one of the starkest signs of difference between Nadia and non-Islamic readers, she is more daring than Saeed. She is the one who offers him marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms, and she is the one who initiates sex. The robe, it turns out, is camouflage to allow Nadia to be an independent woman.

The backdrop for ""Exit West"" is both the plight of refugees from places like Syria and the specter of Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism. Hamid takes full advantage of our familiarity with these scenes to turn ""Exit West"" into an urgent account of war, love and refugees. Politics also matters as it does in his other novels, which likewise dealt with pressing issues: the troubles of contemporary Pakistan (""Moth Smoke""); 9/11 and the tensions between being Pakistani and American (""The Reluctant Fundamentalist""); and naked capitalism and ambition in an unnamed country (""How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia""). Throughout his oeuvre, Hamid envisions an interconnected world in which East and West inevitably meet as a consequence of complicated histories of colonization and globalization. The dramas and love stories of individuals like Saeed and Nadia cannot be separated from these histories, even if, in their own lives, those histories are not necessarily preoccupations. Until, that is, those histories erupt.

When they do, people die. They do so often, unexpectedly and in violent circumstances. Hamid offers a few incidents like this, and in their spare detail they are enough, as when Nadia's cousin is ""blown by a truck bomb to bits, literally to bits, the largest of which, in Nadia's cousin's case, were a head and two-thirds of an arm."" Refusing to dwell on the morbidity of such a scene, Hamid declines to turn the destruction of the city and its people into a spectacle, the way they would normally be visible to those outside the country, watching its doom from a digital distance. Examining the destruction at a slight remove, Hamid discourages readers from pitying the city's residents. Instead, focusing on Saeed and Nadia, and removing the particularities of the city, the country and its customs, Hamid aims to increase the depth of a reader's empathy for characters who can be, or should be, just like the reader. The reader, of course, must think about what would happen if her own normal life was suddenly, unexpectedly upended by war.

Most likely, the reader, like Saeed and Nadia, would flee. They do so through the sudden, unexplained doors that appear throughout the city and that are portals to other places. While the city is unnamed, these sites of refuge are named -- Greece, London, the United States. In their concreteness, versus the deliberate vagueness of Saeed and Nadia's city, they call for identification from readers of the novel who live in these kinds of desirable places that the refugees want to go. The novel implicitly asks these readers why doors should be closed to refugees, when those readers might become refugees one day? How these doors work is not Hamid's concern. The doors can be manifestations of magic realism, fantasy or science fiction, or all three, but they simply stand in for the reality that refugees will try every door they can to get out."

The great halls of Grand Central, the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art each present different painted faces: Grand Central has a swath of the heavens at nighttime, redone 15 years ago; the natural history museum has murals of the life of Theodore Roosevelt, restored last fall; and the Metropolitan Museum, well ... where are the murals, anyway? Grand Central opened in 1913 with what is perhaps the greatest typo in the history of American architecture. The pastel artist Paul Helleu, seeking to reproduce the nighttime constellations in winter, got them backward. That's it; flat backward -- 200-plus feet of backward. When the terminal opened to adulatory reviews, this little detail did not appear; rather it was a commuter from New Rochelle, N.Y., who called the problem to everybody's attention. (To his chagrin, the present author, president of his high school's astronomy club, did not notice this until well into adulthood.)

The railroad, the architects, the artist, stumbled to explain that they meant to give railroad passengers the sense of looking down on earth from space, but it appears the ceiling mural had been copied incorrectly, working from the wrong side from a star chart. Or something. If the Apollo 13 crew had had to navigate on the basis of Helleu's mural, they would be well past Pluto by now.

Still, it is an agreeable thing, a sweep of turquoise with little white lights, although a couple of meteors would have given it some pizazz. The railroad gave Helleu the sky, but over at the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial, the American Museum of Natural History gave William Andrews Mackay the closet. He received three of them -- specifically, colossal recessed spaces that he filled to the edges with giant brightly colored scenes of Roosevelt's giant-size life. Finished in 1936, the murals are screened by large marble columns, so the observer can never take in the whole work. If Mackay beefed about it, the matter has not surfaced; surely in this mid-Depression year scores of muralists envied the commission. The hall itself has a rich coffered ceiling in the Classical mode, but the murals are strictly narrative passages, each panel crammed with depictions of Roosevelt's African hunting expeditions, the building of the Panama Canal and his role in settling the Russo-Japanese War.

During World War I, Mackay was a naval artist in what was called dazzle camouflage -- wild kinetic slices, wedges, stripes and polygons painted in brilliantly contrasting colors, like purple and pink. A Cubist take on Op Art is one way to look at it. He took no such liberties with T. R.'s career, but crowded each frame with dozens of scenes, like Columbus sailing the Atlantic in 1492, engineers and laborers on the Canal, Genghis Khan, a Shinto priest in prayer, the sons of Noah, a group of Grevy's zebras, all nestled together as if pasted into a collage.

And there is plenty of dazzle, too; but in this case it's a blinding set of yellows and reds. Indeed, the works are very hard to interpret: densely packed, starting well above eye level and extending up perhaps 30 feet, sectioned off into niches and chopped up by the columns. Binoculars help, slightly. Some may see the murals as pure jingoism. Others may find it heroic and inspiring that a single man could accomplish so much in a lifetime, a story barely covered by the one-page handout at the information desk. Nor is there a postcard or other evidence of the murals in the gift shop. If you visit, you will have the rare treat of seeing a work of art almost completely unmediated, unmerchandised. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Great Hall of 1902 was designed by Richard Morris Hunt just before he died in 1895, leaving tantalizing and sketchy ideas, like the four blocks of uncarved limestone at the top of the main facade on Fifth Avenue. His sons continued the work, but budget problems and infighting left many things undone or reduced in scope. For instance, the hall was to be in rich white marble instead of the present limestone. In most other Beaux-Arts buildings, the role of the sculptor and muralist is important: the architecture critic Henry Hope Reed has said a building is naked without such decoration. But the triple-dome ceiling at the Met is as bare as a baby's bottom, just a fluffy beige, the lighting adjusted to make the space mushy and indeterminate.

Little was written about the interior, and perhaps the only reference to a mural program appears in The New York Times in 1899, when a reviewer remarked that the neutral limestone was to be set off by murals that ""will supply the color necessary for an effect of brilliance."" That is hardly conclusive, but what if one were to dare to create a series of murals for the Metropolitan interior today? Jeff Greene, the founder of EverGreene Architectural Arts , which restored the Roosevelt murals, pauses at the thought, and says they would almost certainly be purely decorative, without narrative content. The agreement of a century ago about heroism, ideals, culture -- even our history -- no longer exists. ""Today,"" he says, ""it's like speaking Latin."""
60403,Electric-Car Makers' Quest: One Plug to Charge Them All,"As more electric vehicles come on the market, the need for a common standard for fast-charge connectors is growing.",QUICK FILL Nissan's Leaf comes with a socket for the Chademo fast-charging standard.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/28/automobiles/28STAN/28STAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=400&w=600&s=a07cafe70411eed44a7ac48b3c2a2b69a03f16c70886252cc945e20ba9a44d07&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/automobiles/electric-car-makers-quest-one-plug-to-charge-them-all.html,e6106b0f-8499-56f4-906c-a3cb2632d8a8.jpg,"WITH electric cars and plug-in hybrids at last trickling into the showrooms of mainstream automakers, the dream of going gasoline-free is becoming a reality for many drivers. Cars like the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt can cover considerable distances under electric power alone -- certainly enough for local errands and even most daily commutes -- while enabling their owners to shun gas stations. Indeed, charging the car's battery pack at home, or topping up at the office or shopping mall, will work fine for most drivers. But what about trips that are beyond the range of a single battery charge? Couldn't a driver in need simply pull up to a charging kiosk and plug in for a rapid refill? Sure, there are already public charging stations in service, and new ones are coming online daily. But those typically take several hours to fully replenish a battery. As a result, the ability for quick battery boosts -- using a compatible direct current fast charger, the Leaf can refill to 80 percent capacity in 30 minutes -- could potentially become an important point of differentiation among electric models.

But the availability of fast charging points has in part been held up by the lack of an agreement among automakers on a universal method for fast charging -- or even on a single electrical connector. Today's prevalent D.C. fast-charge systems are built to a standard developed in Japan by Nissan, Mitsubishi and Subaru in conjunction with Tokyo Electric Power. Called Chademo, which translates roughly to ""charge and move,"" it uses a connector that is different from the plugs in most electric cars. As a result, a Chademo-compatible car like the Nissan Leaf requires two separate sockets. Overcoming the limitation of a short driving range is vital to achieving acceptance by consumers who want uncompromised, do-everything vehicles. The potential solutions all have drawbacks. Larger batteries are expensive and saddle the car with added weight. An onboard generator turned by a gasoline engine, as used in the Volt plug-in hybrid and similar future models, are another possible solution, but such systems add cost and pounds -- and compromise the emissions-free image that attracts consumers to electric cars in the first place.

All electric cars come with a standard charging cable that can plug into a common 120-volt household electrical outlet. More than just an extension cord, this cable incorporates various safety features. ""There is no energy flowing through the cord until the car talks to the box,"" said Gery Kissel, an engineering specialist for General Motors, referring to the charging cord's electronics. ""It also has a G.F.C.I. and signals the car that the cable is connected, making it impossible for you to drive off if you forget that you're plugged in,"" he said, using the abbreviation for the safety provision known as a ground fault circuit interrupter.

The Leaf and the Volt, as well as future electric cars coming to the American market, can use these 120-volt cords interchangeably because they are all designed to the SAE J1772 standard. A task force assembled by SAE International, an organization of scientists and vehicle engineers, developed the design specifications for the J1772 standard through a committee of 150 carmakers, electrical equipment makers and utilities. Other groups, including the American National Standards Institute, are also working on standards and codes for electric cars. Charging an electric car on a 120-volt circuit, called Level 1 charging, is undeniably slow. The Volt requires about 10 hours to fully charge on 120 volts and the Leaf, with its larger battery, needs closer to 20 hours. For plug-in hybrids, which generally have smaller batteries, Level 1 charging works for overnight and at-work refills, but pure electrics need something stronger.

That next step, called Level 2 charging, uses a 240-volt circuit. Typically, this charging cable is not portable; instead, it's hard-wired to a garage or charging station, though the actual charger is built into the car. These higher-voltage cables also cost extra -- about $2,000, the majority of which goes to the installation. ""This is the type of charger we'll be seeing in parking lots,"" said Nancy Gioia, director for global electrification at Ford Motor. ""The hardware on 120 volts won't provide enough incremental range to satisfy customers."" With a 240-volt unit, the Leaf can recharge a depleted battery in less than eight hours and the Volt can do it in about four. These chargers use the same SAE J1772 connection

As you might expect, with electric cars just starting to reach volume production these chargers are not yet common. Level 2 charging stations are planned for each of Nissan's 1,100 dealers, but the Web site carstations.com lists only about 1,350 charging stations of all types scattered across the 50 states, mostly in California and the Northeast. The Leaf's navigation system can display nearby charging locations. In the long term, however, commercial chargers will proliferate, especially as private companies get into the business. Among these is NRG, a power utility, which announced in April that it would install 120 Level 2 charging stations in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth by the end of 2012. NRG will charge fixed monthly fees to use the stations, with a three-year contract. For unlimited usage the rate is $89 a month, or $1,068 a year -- the equivalent of 7,000 miles in a car that gets 25 m.p.g. with gas costing $4 a gallon. The NRG charging stations will incorporate not only Level 2 chargers, but also D.C. fast chargers. Fast chargers have complex hardware -- a permanent installation, not an onboard system -- that requires a connection to 480-volt three-phase alternating current. Sensitive circuitry is needed to convert this high-voltage A.C. power into direct current without frying the car's battery. As you might expect, such chargers are expensive -- at least $20,000 for the charger and another $20,000 for the installation. The payoff is the ability to charge a Leaf's battery to 80 percent capacity in half an hour, compared with six hours on a Level 2 charger or roughly 15 on a Level 1. Or put another way, 10 minutes on a D.C. fast charger can add about 30 miles of range. The SAE committee is working on a modification of the J1772 connector to incorporate this high-powered D.C. charging as well as the existing Level 1 and 2 charging in a single connector. ""BMW prefers the SAE 1772 approach to having a single connector,"" said Rich Steinberg, manager for electric vehicle operations and strategy at BMW North America, echoing the view of many carmakers. The revised J1772 prototype will not be ready until this fall, according to Peter Byk of SAE, and the final version is unlikely to be ready until late 2012.

At least in the view of the Leaf's maker, there is no disaster in the offing. ""A Chademo charger could conceivably be reconfigured as an SAE charger,"" said Mark Perry, product planning director at Nissan North America. ""It could even have both plugs to accommodate all electric vehicles."" As the only fast-charging game in town for now, 17 Chademo-type fast chargers, manufactured by AeroVironment of California, will be installed on Interstate 5 from the southern border of Oregon to the northern border of Washington this year. The plan is to eventually extend them all the way to the southern border of California. Still, the experience will have its shortcomings. Consider a Nissan Leaf that can go about 70 miles at highway speeds on a full charge. At the 80 percent charge delivered by a fast chargers, that drops to 56 miles, which you'd cover in 48 minutes at 70 m.p.h. That means travelers would spend as much time charging as they would driving. To match the convenience of a conventional car on the highway will require a combination of much greater electrical range with an even faster charging time, neither of which is around the corner. But for urban use, each new charger installation will improve the utility of all electric cars."

46877,Marcella Hazan and Her Namesake Bean,"Steve Sando grows the Marcella bean in California, prodded by the woman widely considered to be the Julia Child of Italian cooking.","Marcella Hazan, shown here in a 2008 photo.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/06/dining/06BEANS2/06BEANS2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=0661bf6d84639cb94a21b0db703e94a2715126e11203da1ab7eaac01cc15ca25&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/dining/marcella-hazan-rancho-gordo-beans.html,197280b2-0fbe-50d5-824f-1aefe11dc451.jpg,"Six years ago, Steve Sando was scrolling through mail orders at his specialty-food company, Rancho Gordo, when he spotted one that stopped him short. He fulfilled the order -- for several pounds of beans and a copy of his first cookbook -- and inscribed the book. ""I was a little gushy,"" he admitted. Soon after, he received a Facebook friend request from the buyer. So began an online correspondence with the celebrated cookbook author that produced the Marcella bean, which Mr. Sando has raised, and named after her.

Beans may have originated in Latin America, but no one worships at their altar quite the way Italians do. For Mr. Sando, 55, whose business in Napa, Calif., is known for its heirloom beans, receiving the request from the Italian-born Mrs. Hazan, then 85 and widely considered to be the Julia Child of Italian cooking, was like a priest getting a text from the pope. Jason Henry for The New York Times ""To Marcella, one of the ultimate pleasures in life was warm beans with good olive oil,"" said her husband, Victor Hazan, 87, who lives in Longboat Key, Fla., where Mrs. Hazan lived before her death in 2013. Like the current pope, Mrs. Hazan enjoyed communing with her disciples. ""She loved to talk to anyone who shared her moral sense about cooking,"" Mr. Hazan said. ""Food had to be genuine -- made to satisfy, not to impress."" Not only did she often call people who sent fan mail, but she also insisted on having her name listed in the phone book, and frequently fielded questions about her recipes. ""She enjoyed it,"" Mr. Hazan said. ""Of course, if she was in the middle of watching a movie, she'd say, 'I'll call you back.'"" She and Mr. Sando, however, were more kindred spirits than mere acquaintances. ""They were as friendly as can be for two people who never met,"" said Mr. Hazan. At first, they bonded over their mutual affection for Italian pop music; Mr. Sando lived in Milan in the late 1980s -- long after Mrs. Hazan immigrated to the United States -- and hosted a radio show. They traded notes on their favorite singers.

Inevitably, the conversation turned to beans. Mr. Sando asked Mrs. Hazan which ones she missed most from Italy, expecting her to choose a variety famous among the ""bean people"" he knew -- the lamon, for instance, the cranberry bean grown in the Venetian province of Belluno, or the zolfino, the pale yellow Tuscan bean that he described as ""delicate, almost gelatinous orbs."" Jason Henry for The New York Times Instead, she picked the sorana, calling it ""the most precious bean grown in Italy."" Mr. Sando had never heard of it. ""Grow them,"" Mrs. Hazan wrote to Mr. Sando, ""and you have a customer."" The sorana is a variety of cannellini grown in small quantities along the Pescia River near the town of Sorana. Uncommon even in Tuscany and virtually impossible to find in the United States, it is perhaps the most prized bean in the land of the so-called mangiafagioli (bean eaters), which is a bit like being the most sought-after grape in Burgundy. The bean's renown had been established by at least the early 19th century, when the opera composer and gourmand Gioachino Rossini -- he of ""The Barber of Seville,"" the famous tournedos and the lovely sentiment that ""appetite is for the stomach what love is for the heart"" -- accepted several pounds of sorana as payment for correcting another composer's score. ""The wonderful thing about the bean is that its skin is impalpable,"" Mr. Hazan said. ""Each bean is just a single sweet, creamy substance."" Mr. Sando got to work. For his business, he scouts heirloom beans and contracts a network of farmers to grow them in California's Central Valley, as well as in Oregon and Washington. He and his staff spent many months chasing down sorana seeds, poring over European catalogs, interrogating exporters and tracking down farmers until, at last, he purchased a modest amount and had them planted. As the beans grew, he sent Mrs. Hazan updates. ""I'd email: 'They're in the ground! I can't wait to send you some!'"" he said. The first harvest was meager, even for characteristically low-yielding heirlooms, but there were enough beans to do two things: attempt a second planting and send a small bag of them to Mrs. Hazan.

But before Mr. Sando could ship it, he heard the news that echoed throughout the food world: Mrs. Hazan had died. A few months later, on a whim, Mr. Sando asked Mr. Hazan whether he could name them after his wife, as a tribute. He knew he would have to rechristen them anyway. Growers of the sorana in Italy have established a protocol to protect the location and traditional methods of production, so his beans weren't technically soranas. Mr. Hazan agreed, and the new crop, harvested in September, yielded a hearty supply, which is now available for sale on the Rancho Gordo website. To prepare the Marcella bean, Mr. Sando channels the woman whose books taught him the joys of uncomplicated, ingredient-driven food. He eschews chicken stock, ham bones and other flavoring agents, and instead opts for water, olive oil and salt, occasionally ""tarting up"" the liquid with aromatics like carrot and garlic and herbs like thyme or sage. He serves the beans in a bowl with a splash of the cooking liquor or piles them on toast, always with more olive oil and salt. The keys, he says, are particularly gentle cooking of the beans -- no stirring and the most placid of simmers, with bubbles that barely break the water's surface -- and extra vigilance. ""If you don't cook them long enough, you'll think, 'What's the big whoop?'"" he said. ""But cook them too long and they'll fall apart."" After that, just stay out of their way. ""Remember,"" he said, ""it's about the bean."""

But there's nowhere to go.





'If No Tourists Come, I Have No Business': New York's Tourism Crisis

Outside Kennedy International Airport's Terminal 4, the long line of New York City yellow cabs that in years past rotated like a conveyor belt to meet the demand of passenger arrivals has disappeared. The wraparound rows where riders line up to hail a cab are empty. Where usually a dozen cabs idle to pick up travelers, last Thursday two were parked. The drivers can wait for hours before picking up a single passenger. ""I have no fares. There's no flights coming in, no tourists visiting and there's less people on the streets,"" said Jean Metellus, a 71-year-old Queens resident who has owned his taxi since 1988. ""So there's no business, but we still have to pay the bills."" The pandemic and the global travel restrictions introduced in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus have decimated the American tourism industry, taking with it the livelihoods of millions of people. The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group that promotes travel to and within the country, projects that the United States will see the number of international visitors plummet nearly 80 percent this year, to only 18.6 million, compared to 79 million arrivals last year.

Now citizens from countries across the world -- including Britain, China and Brazil, the three most important markets for tourists visiting New York -- are banned from entering the country. At the state's five regional airports in July, international arrivals were down by 93 percent, according to Port Authority data, compared to July 2019. At Kennedy alone, the number of arriving international flights fell 70 percent in six months, to 2,121 in July, down from 7,034 in January. In August, fewer than 400,000 international passengers arrived at Kennedy, down a whopping 89 percent from more than 3.5 million during the same month the previous year. The city's food and beverage sector has lost nearly 200,000 jobs since March. The occupancy rate for hotels is down to about 40 percent, a decrease from the more than 80 percent in August 2019, according to the hospitality analytics firm STR. Demand for taxis and ride-app services in June was down by 71 percent, according to New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission, though lately those numbers have begun to rebound.

In Times Square, the vibrant street signs still shine, but more than half of the hotels in the area have closed and foot traffic has cratered. At Columbus Circle, pedicab bikers hunch over their handlebars, looking at their phones. Red tour buses continue to make daily rounds, but they drive empty past abandoned landmarks as their agents scavenge the sidewalks for local tourists. Souvenir shops across Manhattan that would receive up to as many as 30 customers an hour stand empty with no buyers for the marked-down suitcases, trinkets and ""I  NY"" T-shirts. ""If no tourists come, I have no business,"" said Prince Mahamud, who runs a souvenir shop on Canal Street in Chinatown, on a recent weekday. ""Souvenirs are for tourists,"" he said as he lifted a tiny green plastic figurine of the Statue of Liberty. ""No New Yorker is buying this."" In 2019, New York's tourism industry marked its tenth consecutive year of growth, bringing in almost $7 billion in state and local taxes and supporting more than 403,000 jobs, according to NYC & Company, the city's tourism marketing agency. The stream of tourists and the dollars they brought in dried up in March. No landmark or neighborhood was spared.

""It's been a rough few months,"" a doorman at the residential section of the Plaza Hotel said last Tuesday, as he adjusted his blue mask and pointed toward the closed hotel guest entrance. ""They've all gone."" He was not only referring to hotel guests, but to fellow employees, who are still out of work as the hotel remains closed. As of August, the comptroller's office projected a loss of at least $1.5 billion in all taxable tourism sales for 2021. Nationally, the U.S. Travel Association forecasts a 75 percent drop in international travel spending by the end of year, to $39 billion from $155 billion in 2019. ""Tourism in the city, especially international tourism, will not return to pre-pandemic levels until there is a feeling that travel is safe, and many stores and restaurants cannot survive a prolonged loss of business,"" Mr. Stringer said, adding that ""massive federal support"" is needed to tackle the tremendous scale of the issue.

On a recent Thursday, a tour bus operator stood on the corner of 48th Street and Seventh Avenue trying to sell bus tickets. Misbah Saley, 47, used to manage a team of tour agents, but his company laid off staff in response to the pandemic and he is back in the field, acting as an agent and dispatcher. ""It's been very bad and very slow,"" he said. Before the pandemic, Mr. Saley said he would sell 2,000 to 3,000 bus tickets a week. Now he sells about 450, mainly to tourists from the tristate area. ""This business has been completely reliant on tourism. Not only are we not seeing customers from other parts of the world, but we're not seeing customers from farther than other parts of the state."" A historic draw to the area was Broadway. Every year, the shows contribute more than $15 billion to the local economy and support 97,000 jobs, according to the Broadway League, a trade group. This year, after closing in March, the dark theaters have no plans to reopen until 2021 at the earliest.

Monique Scott, a 30-year-old freelance performer with a focus in musical theater, came to New York City with dreams of performing. With no gigs currently available, she is now working a part-time job at a fitness studio to make ends meet. ""A lot of performers, represented or not, are in limbo,"" Ms. Scott said. ""We're all just sitting on our hands and not practicing our craft. We just had to dismiss all the things that we've worked so hard on and are in debt for."" The evaporation of the stream of tourists to Times Square is evident beyond Broadway. ""Before all this, I couldn't count the number of customers I'd have in a day,"" said Ossama Elsayed, a 43-year-old hot dog and pretzel vendor who recently moved his cart from Times Square to a new spot on West 46th Street and Broadway. ""Today, I've had only three customers,"" he said. ""I'm making no money,"" he continued. ""I have three kids to take care of and my wife is not working. I need this work to pick up.""

In Grand Central Terminal, more than half of the restaurants, bakeries and breakfast spots are closed. The transportation hub, which buzzed no matter the hour of the day, is now so quiet one recent visitor could hear the rolling wheels of a faraway suitcase. The Grand Central Oyster Bar largely depends on travelers and commuters. Restaurants in New York City were able to open indoor dining at 25 percent capacity last week, but without the heavy foot traffic of travelers in the terminal, the Oyster Bar, which reopened last week, has been sitting mostly empty. ""We're down about 90 percent of all business, maybe even more,"" said Sandy Ingber, the executive chef. ""We put out an email blast to 25,000 people from our database. And still, we've got nobody here."" About 80 percent of customers at the restaurant since reopening had been local return customers. Mr. Ingber sees about 80 to 100 guests a day and operates on a shorter schedule, he said, compared to 1,000 to 1,500 a day he would see this time of the year in 2019. ""We're waiting to see if the cold drives people indoors,"" Mr. Ingber said. ""But as far as the Christmas season goes, I don't think we'll see much of a difference.""

Making the most of the newfound calm on Mulberry Street in Little Italy, local New Yorkers, who until now had avoided the area because of the throngs of tourists, are increasingly visiting the neighborhood. Last week, Julia Gold, a 23-year-old waitress at the Italian restaurant Gelso & Grand, was serving about four tables at the restaurant's outdoor dining area. ""The biggest difference for us is that there are more local, young New Yorkers coming to eat here. It's been nice,"" she said. ""Honestly, we're still very busy, especially on weekends and nights. It's hard to say, as this is all uncharted territory for everybody, what the future of dining out is supposed to look like. But I've found that locals are dying to come out and eat and be served.""

Hotels that have reopened since lockdown are also reporting local interest, especially from those seeking luxury experiences. ""We are navigating our way through these new challenges one day at a time,"" said Isabelle Hogan, the chief concierge at The Mark Hotel on Manhattan's Upper East Side. ""We have been pleasantly surprised to see that although NYC may lack 'tourism,' a luxury hotel experience is still desired by locals, who either want a change of scenery from their apartment or are between homes."" Roger Dow, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Travel Association, says the resumption of international travel will be gradual and the most urgent need in the interim is federal support, which is being held up in Congress. Since approving nearly $3 trillion in economic relief this spring, Congress and the White House have failed to reach agreement on another economic package. On Tuesday, President Trump called on Congress to pass relief for airlines and small businesses, after retreating from negotiations on a broader coronavirus relief package. ""The key thing for people to understand is that the travel business is really 83 percent small businesses,"" Mr. Dow said. ""Even though you've got the big names of the airlines, cruise companies and hotel companies, the majority are small business operators, restaurants, shops, tour guides, all people that really can't afford to hang on very long.""

""There's normally so many people out here, and look, nobody is coming here,"" said Mr. Mahamud, the shopkeeper on Canal Street. ""This was a visitor area. It's central and Chinatown is famous."" The 34-year-old Brooklyn resident has cut the price of most of his products nearly in half to try to attract more business. Five dollar pens, he's now selling for $3. Twenty- to fifteen-dollar toys, he's now selling for $5. His business used to rake in about $2,000 a day, but now, he said, he only takes in about $200 to $240 a day. ""I'm hoping, by Christmas, it comes back,"" he said. ""But people are afraid. And if people have no money, they aren't buying. People are struggling to pay rent and buy food. So they aren't coming here."""

The change, announced Tuesday, will affect the four most prestigious categories: album, record and song of the year, and best new artist. (Record of the year recognizes a single recording, while the song prize is for songwriters.) The new rule will go into effect immediately, with members voting on nominations this fall for the 61st annual show next year.

""This change will better reflect the large number of entries in these categories and allow voters greater flexibility when selecting this year's best recordings,"" the Recording Academy, the organization behind the awards, said in a note to its members.

The revision comes after a rough season for the Grammys, when both the show and the management of the academy came under fire. At this year's ceremony, in January, the sole woman nominated for album of the year -- Lorde -- did not have a solo performance spot, and just one woman was given a solo award in one of the handful of televised categories (Alessia Cara, for best new artist)."

Why stop there? Given carte blanche to break down boundaries, Ms. Neuwirth went all-out. Her director, Polly Graham, and libretto collaborator, Catherine Filloux, are women -- as is Rei Kawakubo, the couture titan of Commes des Garcons, who designed the costumes. Among the stars is the queer cabaret artist Justin Vivian Bond, trading Joe's Pub in Manhattan for one of Europe's grandest stages. Ms. Neuwirth's inspiration is Virginia Woolf's ""Orlando,"" a fictional, often funny biography that blurs both genre and gender. While the novel ends on the day of its publication, in 1928, Ms. Neuwirth sails on into the present, telling the centuries-long life story of a poet -- a man of Elizabethan England who later becomes a woman overnight and never seems to age -- in three hours.

It is, though, a triumph of orchestral writing. Conducted by Matthias Pintscher with a mastery of Ms. Neuwirth's organized chaos, the score is a wry and sweeping musical analogue to Woolf's novel, a journey through time with references so fleeting you can rarely locate them with complete confidence. One suggestion of Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" comes and goes like a whiplash. In a program note and interviews, Ms. Neuwirth has described aiming for a kind of androgyny in sound. She dissolves the line between what's acoustic and digital, what's onstage and off. Unsettlingly, the second violins are tuned ever so slightly lower than the firsts. A choir singing from a loft above the auditorium chandelier creates a cognitive dissonance, with another performing simultaneously onstage. As with Ms. Neuwirth's previous operas -- including an adaptation of David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" -- the score calls for a substantial library of samples; the live electronics and sound design are by Ms. Neuwirth, Markus Noisternig, Gilbert Nouno and Clement Cornuau. A punching bag that appears onstage in the first scene is outfitted with microphones and incorporated into the music as the young Orlando beats it with a bat. But for all her ingenuity, Ms. Neuwirth treats the vocal writing like an afterthought. It has some wit -- the soprano Constance Hauman, as Queen Elizabeth and two other characters, sometimes performs in a parody of operatic voice -- but many in the cast aren't given enough to make a strong impression. Kate Lindsey, an intense mezzo-soprano, sings Orlando as a young man at an uncomfortably low register, then higher after her transformation into a woman; in a show about androgyny, this feels like a misfire.

The opera hews closely to the novel during Act I. The young man becomes a favorite of Queen Elizabeth; experiences heartbreak during the Great Frost of 1608; and writes poetry, hoping to share it with a celebrity in the field, Nicholas Greene (the baritone Leigh Melrose, with vocal swings reminiscent of Mr. Eddy in Ms. Neuwirth's ""Lost Highway""). Presiding over all this is the Guardian Angel: Eric Jurenas, whose smooth and full-bodied countertenor was a highlight. Orlando becomes an ambassador abroad, where one day he wakes up as a woman -- in a rose-and-mint dress with a mane-like collar of flowers -- and the effectively second-class life that comes with that new gender. By the end of Act I, in a departure from the novel and the beginning of the opera's more glaring politics, she speaks of sexual abuses against children in Victorian-era Britain and vows to rewrite history for women. It's a hefty promise for Act II, and Ms. Neuwirth never quite delivers on it. We meet Shelmerdine, Orlando's husband-to-be (Mr. Melrose again), who shares her mid-length wavy hair and angular features -- and, eventually, her child, played by Mx. Bond (who prefers that gender-neutral honorific). Then the plot speeds through the 20th century in a prolonged montage of a world in which swords have been replaced by atomic bombs, and boundaries of identity have been torn down like the Berlin Wall. The action comes to a standstill once, during World War II, when Orlando stands alone on the empty stage as the names of victims of the Holocaust are projected on curtains; the score samples a 1928 recording of the slow movement from Bach's double violin concerto, played by Arnold Rose and his daughter Alma, who died at the Birkenau concentration camp in 1944. A slowly building alarm creeps into the rending music, then the stage is cleared with a sonic blast -- one so powerful it shakes the seats of the theater. As the dust settles, so to speak, the onstage screens show the bombed-out Vienna State Opera in the aftermath of the war.

There's no time to grieve, though: Time keeps sprinting toward the present, past the brightly modish 1960s and the late '80s, when a publisher tells Orlando that ""genre-bending"" would be disastrous for her career as a writer. Sprinkled throughout are quotations from the lyrics of pop songs like Lady Gaga's ""Born This Way"" and the trippy ""Coming,"" which closes Sally Potter's 1992 film adaptation of ""Orlando."" When Orlando's child enters (visibly struggling through a part that doesn't play to Mx. Bond's gifts), the opera's politics become increasingly caustic, even sophomoric. Mx. Bond denounces the patriarchy; Orlando is alarmed by the rise of nationalism, as President Trump's likeness and voice are distorted until nearly unrecognizable; and a chorus of children warns ""Our planet is in danger!"" These moments, which lose sight of Orlando's story and contain all the subtlety of protest signs, grow tiresome as the hours go on. Then the plot arrives at the day of the performance. In Woolf's novel, the present is a ""terrifying revelation."" But on Sunday, it was just a sign that the opera was ending -- at last. Through Dec. 20 at the Vienna State Opera; wiener-staatsoper.at.

Those who were young during Bill Clinton's first term as president may know David Lowery as the wry alt-rocker who sang Cracker's trippy 1993 hit ""Low."" Those who are about a decade older likely think of Mr. Lowery instead as the wry college-rock guy who sang Camper Van Beethoven's surreal 1985 song ""Take the Skinheads Bowling."" Fans of all ages can enjoy this show, where Mr. Lowery will front both bands on a double bill.

212-414-5994, highlineballroom.com ANDERSON EAST at Music Hall of Williamsburg (Jan. 12, 9 p.m.). A Nashville journeyman with a taste for classic 1960s soul, Anderson East takes his deepest swig yet of that genre with his new album, ""Encore."" Blink and you might think you're listening to an above-average Otis Redding impersonator, or Joe Cocker's long-lost nephew. Mr. East will celebrate the album's release on Friday evening with this Brooklyn show.

888-929-7849, musichallofwilliamsburg.com HAMILTON LEITHAUSER at Cafe Carlyle (Jan. 16-20 and 23-27, 8:45 p.m.). As the lead singer of the 2000s indie-rock band the Walkmen, Hamilton Leithauser perfected an instantly identifiable vocal style -- gruff, romantic, a little desperate, a little louche. Mr. Leithauser has continued to explore these moods since that group went on hiatus in 2012, most recently via a fetching duet with Angel Olsen. His latest venture is this 10-show solo residency at the upscale Upper East Side supper club Cafe Carlyle.

THE SHONDES at the Silent Barn (Jan. 12, 8 p.m.). Loud, outspoken and as passionate about the radical possibilities of romance as it is about radical politics, this Brooklyn-based group is well suited to cut through the nihilistic noise of 2018. This Friday night show at Bushwick's Silent Barn, coming more than a year after the band's most recent album, ""Brighton,"" is a welcome chance to hear what the Shondes have been up to lately. With Perennial and Alecks.

silentbarn.org WAX IDOLS at Elsewhere (Jan. 12, 6 p.m.). This group's most recent album, ""American Tragic,"" from 2015, is a minor masterpiece of darkly glamorous goth-pop. If you didn't hear it then, it's not too late to discover its delights now -- and you'll be ahead of the game when Wax Idols' follow-up, ""Happy Ending,"" which the band's charismatic singer-songwriter, Hether Fortune, has described as a macabre concept LP, arrives later this year. In the meantime, this show at the multilevel Brooklyn event space Elsewhere is a good choice for anyone seeking wintry thrills. With Future Punx and Desert Sharks.

HARRIS EISENSTADT'S 'POSCHIAVO 50' AND PLAY at the Owl (Jan. 18, 7:30 p.m.). Mr. Eisenstadt, a drummer, is also possessed of a cinematic compositional voice. He wrote 50 short pieces during a residency at the Uncool Festival in Switzerland last year, and he's been gradually unveiling them at the Owl, playing one show per month since November. For each concert he's enlisted one or two different collaborators; at this one he'll be joined by two fellow percussionists: Patricia Brennan on vibraphone and Chris Dingman on marimba. Also on the bill is Play, a trio led by the drummer Vinnie Sperrazza and featuring the pianist Jacob Sacks and the bassist Masa Kamaguchi. Play investigates the repertoires of mid-20th-century composers, usually in a briskly swinging style.

718-774-0042, theowl.nyc BILLY HARPER QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 12-14; 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Harper was of the most consistently exciting tenor saxophonists to emerge in the late 1960s and early '70s. He seemed to wield his horn like hot iron; his book of compositions, meanwhile, read as an insurrectionary tract, while fusing concepts from John Coltrane and Joe Henderson. His powers are undiminished, though we haven't seen a leadership recording from him in roughly a decade, and he does not headline his own shows in New York often enough. Catch him here with Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Francesca Tanksley on piano, Hwansu Kang on bass and Aaron Scott on drums.

Mr. Harrell boasts a smoky surety on both trumpet and flugelhorn; at 71, he's making some of the best music of his career, employing his bop-Romantic sensibility in midsize ensembles that feature some fabulous supporting actors. Through Sunday, he performs with Danny Grissett on piano, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Adam Cruz on drums. After a break on Monday, the band plays six more nights with Jaleel Shaw joining on alto saxophone, and the drummer Joe Dyson subbing for Mr. Cruz. 

212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com KEYON HARROLD AND FRIENDS at the Blue Note (Jan. 15-18, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). In the fall Mr. Harrold released a bold, expansive album, ""The Mugician."" It finds his trumpet coaxing an electrified ensemble into all sorts of approaches -- slow-jam, vague Caribbean groove, contemporary jazz balladry -- then tearing into them with animated, inventive soloing. He will draw on that material here, likely with special guests. (The album features a long list of guest vocalists, and when he played the Blue Note last January, Mr. Harrold brought along the rapper Big K.R.I.T. and the vocalist Bilal.)

212-475-8592, bluenote.net ANNA WEBBER at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 18, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The compositions of Ms. Webber, a saxophonist and multi-reedist, play in fresh ways with chime and repetition and schematics. The synced-up interactions she has with her band don't feel clinical or bolted down; they're open and resonant and exposed to the wind. Here she leads a remarkable septet, featuring Jeremy Viner on tenor saxophone and clarinet, Jacob Garchik on trombone, Chris Hoffman on cello, Matt Mitchell on piano, Chris Tordini on bass and Ches Smith on drums and vibraphone.

15524,The Risk in Suspending Vaccine Patent Rules,The system that built a coronavirus vaccine in record time relies on robust intellectual property protections.,"A Covid-19 vaccine trial in Soweto, South Africa, in June.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/10/opinion/10cueni-02/10cueni-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine-patents.html,4422807d-31cf-5cc7-a1fe-09dd25f0cc4a.jpg,"Companies can afford to license patents for free, or sell drugs at cost, precisely because they know that their intellectual property will be protected. That's not a flaw in the system; it's how the system ensures that pharmaceutical research will continue to be funded.

Take ""messenger RNA,"" the technology platform that supports the vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Ozlem Tureci and Ugur Sahin, the wife-and-husband team at the helm of BioNTech, began exploring the use of mRNA more than 25 years ago and founded their company in 2008. Theoretically, mRNA can instruct the body to engineer proteins, including ones that increase immunity against infectious pathogens, cancers and rare genetic conditions. But the Covid-19 vaccines are the first truly successful applications of this technology. Scientists eager to explore future uses of mRNA will struggle to find investment if intellectual property protections are snatched away when others deem it necessary.

Critics of intellectual property rights cite public investment in research as a reason to waive patent protections. They correctly point out that governments bankroll important, early-stage research across the sciences. It's true that without public funds from agencies like the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority or the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, global drug companies might not have developed Covid-19 vaccines so quickly. But here, the funding principally helped reduce risk and accelerate production timelines -- the research and development were still driven by scientists in the private sector. Further, governments have neither the money nor the risk tolerance to take over the role of businesses in developing pharmacy-ready medicines.

There is no available substitute for private funding in bringing new medicines to market. Directing government labs to manufacture medicines, for example, would politicize drug development, empowering politicians and their appointees to decide which research lines were worth funding.

There is also no reason to fear a Covid-19 vaccine monopoly. According to the World Health Organization, there are 214 Covid-19 vaccine projects around the world; 52 are in clinical trials, with 13 in the most advanced phase of testing. Seven have been approved for emergency or limited use in various countries. In short, we are rapidly headed for a competitive marketplace, the opposite of a monopoly.

There are, to be sure, serious obstacles to distributing Covid-19 vaccines quickly and fairly around the world. But they have nothing to do with intellectual property. The challenge, rather, is speedy manufacturing. A study from the U.S. Defense Department estimated that it would cost $1.56 billion over 25 years to build and operate a facility producing three vaccines. Facilities cost less in developing countries like India, but only marginally. The equipment required to manufacture vaccines -- bioreactors, centrifuges, cold storage and the like -- is expensive everywhere. That's why Covid-19 vaccine production is taking place almost exclusively in existing facilities.

Dismantling patent protection would do nothing to expand access to vaccines or to boost global manufacturing capacity. Research scientists develop vaccines in record time because they have the security and resources that come with a robust system of protection for their intellectual property. That system is crucial to allowing companies to create the vaccines we need for wide distribution.

Property records show that Mr. Lewis bought the sponsor unit in 2008 for around $10 million.

Ms. Roosevelt, citing a strict confidentiality agreement, declined to comment on the transaction. The buyer was identified in city records as Michael B. Kim.

Mr. Dorsey said he would put 28 percent of his wealth, in the form of shares in his mobile payments company Square, into a limited liability company that he had created, called Start Small. Start Small would make grants to beneficiaries, he said, with the expenditures to be recorded in a publicly accessible Google document. ""Why now? The needs are increasingly urgent, and I want to see the impact in my lifetime,"" Mr. Dorsey said in a series of tweets announcing his plans. ""I hope this inspires others to do something similar.""

Oprah Winfrey has donated more than $10 million of her personal wealth to Covid-19 relief efforts, while other Hollywood personalities -- including Justin Timberlake, Dolly Parton and Rihanna -- have also made contributions. Last week, the Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said he would donate $100 million to American food banks through a nonprofit, Feeding America. And Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, has also organized relief campaigns through Facebook and his own philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Even so, Mr. Dorsey's contribution stands out for the sum he is putting in and for how much of his net worth that represents. Square declined a request for an interview with Mr. Dorsey. Twitter declined to comment. In creating a limited liability company, Mr. Dorsey is following a model that Mr. Zuckerberg has used. In 2015, when Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, set up the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, it was organized as an L.L.C., holding much of their wealth to fund charitable causes. At the time, critics said the vehicle was a self-serving maneuver that allowed Mr. Zuckerberg to engage in private lobbying, for-profit investment and political donations. Mr. Zuckerberg pushed back, saying a limited liability company gave him and his wife more control over how their resources would be put to use.

Mr. Dorsey, who has been criticized in the past for his lack of transparency around philanthropic efforts, said he was creating an L.L.C. for flexibility and pledged to use the Google document to update the public on its latest grants, stock transfers and sales. He said the first $100,000 donation would be to America's Food Fund, a high-profile effort committed to feeding the hungry. It was started in a GoFundMe page last week by Leonardo DiCaprio, Laurene Powell Jobs and Apple. After the most pressing matters of the pandemic are resolved, Mr. Dorsey said, he plans to shift the aim of Start Small to supporting initiatives around universal basic income, under which Americans would get a base level of regular income from the federal government, and women's health and education efforts. Universal basic income has been a pet issue for some Silicon Valley progressives, made more popular in recent months by the now-ended presidential candidacy of Andrew Yang, a Democrat who ran partly on the idea. ""Life is too short, so let's do everything we can today to help people now,"" Mr. Dorsey tweeted, followed by an emoji of a peace sign hand gesture."
46714,"Hillsong Unites Believers and Those Old Agnostics John, Paul, George and Ringo","More than a thousand worshipers attended a Pentecostal singalong whose set list included Beatles hits like ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Here Comes the Sun.""",Members of Hillsong Church attended a Beatles-themed Christmas show at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Sunday.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/21/fashion/21HILLSONG1/21HILLSONG1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b188a3c95047a4c2db9e81e68bd38aade273c636aa70c13aa8cc6be2be55fd12&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/style/hillsong-christmas-beatles.html,f97d950b-145d-53bb-913e-29f137d54969.jpg,"Hillsong Unites Believers and Those Old Agnostics John, Paul, George and Ringo

The Beatles did not have a great relationship with Jesus Christ. In 1964, the band's publicist told the Saturday Evening Post that the boys were ""completely anti-Christ."" In 1966, John Lennon said the Beatles were ""more popular than Jesus"" -- a remark that would haunt him until the end of his life. But Christianity is a storied colonizer, and on Sunday, when a group of performers at a Hillsong megachurch in Manhattan made a rapid switch from singing ""All You Need Is Love"" to their own hymn, ""O Come Let Us Adore Him,"" the transition was seamless. Hillsong, a Pentecostal megachurch that was founded more than 30 years ago in Sydney and spread on the back of a hugely successful Christian recording label, has between 9,000 and 10,000 members in New York -- most of them young, racially diverse and screamingly fashionable. On Sunday, more than 2,300 of them packed the 2,200-seat Hammerstein Ballroom for the first of two evening services, after which was to come a musical production.

""I just Googled churches in New York, and this was the first option that came up,"" she said. It stands to reason that someone at Hillsong has mastered SEO. The church has made inroads with digitally-savvy young professionals in more than 20 cities worldwide, including four in the United States. Its New York members are WeWork employees, N.Y.U. musical theater majors, social media mavens, life coaches and Netflix actors. The service, led by six singers of various races and genders with uniformly excellent hair, came to a close and it was show time. Nathan Finochio, a teaching pastor at Hillsong and the mastermind behind the production, emerged on a stage in the crowd's midst, clad in an electric blue uniform like the one Paul McCartney wore on the cover of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" (Mr. McCartney is Mr. Finochio's favorite Beatle.) He and 102 other performers, dressed as if they had gotten lost on the way to SantaCon, belted that record's title track.

The show went quickly. The three kings reached Joseph and Mary, both played by black actors, within the initial minutes. Mr. Finochio and the other performers interspersed dialogue and sermon, performing versions of ""Blackbird"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" during which Mary handed Baby Jesus to a responsible reindeer so she could cut a rug with Joseph. As George Harrison's ""Here Comes the Sun"" played to celebrate Jesus's return from Egypt, the crowd on the second-floor balcony turned on their cellphone flashlights to mimic candles and waved their arms in devotion. The band's lyrics and arrangements were largely left alone; the Beatles may have talked a big old atheist game, but it's not difficult to see the religiosity in their songs. (At least, apparently, the ones Ringo didn't have a hand in.)

Backstage after the show, Mr. Finochio, who has Christ-length hair and a deadpan sense of humor, admitted that he had been so nervous that he verged on panic. His production came together with many happy accidents, including a notably diverse cast that reflected Hillsong's membership. Had he meant to imply that baby Jesus -- swaddled in blankets and barely perceptible -- was black, too? ""The Holy Spirit is technically his biological father so he would be mixed-race,"" Mr. Finochio said.

He was thoughtful when asked why he thought that millennials, who are stereotypically averse to institutions, religious or otherwise, were attracted to Hillsong. He quoted something often attributed to St. Augustine -- ""the church is a whore, but she is my mother"" -- and said that skepticism for the church was healthy. He seemed less able to explain the attraction. But he said that the joy displayed in the show was a fitting example of Hillsong's appeal. ""Sometimes Christians suck at partying,"" he said, pointing out that a group of people who feel assured that they are going to heaven should have less trouble lightening up. ""Christians should be known as the biggest partyers in the world."""
50636,G.M. Job Shift From Mexico Tests a Trump Premise,"Far from a reversal of globalization, a General Motors deal bringing auto jobs back to Canada from Mexico underscores the primacy of markets.","A General Motors plant in Oshawa, Canada. The company agreed to cease manufacturing at an engine factory in Mexico.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/21/business/TRADE1/TRADE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=0ac88d6bf1f1485b6b78157a8dc5a63fc1409c4e3b571b54e51386ff08d91571&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/business/economy/gm-jobs-move-north-at-a-price.html,ce73de5a-d125-58d3-9a1b-5e4b5e8a9384.jpg,"In the realm of international trade, it is a truism seemingly as consistent as gravity: Jobs and investment flow from north to south, while manufactured goods travel the other way around. Factories in the United States and Canada shutter as work shifts to Mexico and Central America, where human hands do it more cheaply. So the established order of trade was by all appearances turned upside down on Tuesday, as General Motors agreed to cease manufacturing an automobile engine at a factory in Mexico while moving jobs to a plant in Canada. One might reflexively assume that this turn effectively validates a central promise made repeatedly by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential aspirant. Loudly and frequently, Mr. Trump has vowed to yank jobs back to America from Mexico, using shame, executive fiat and his uniquely Trumpian form of threats to make it happen. Here was apparent proof that such a goal was doable. Except life turns out to be more complicated than that. The General Motors deal does indeed signal that work can today wind up transferred seemingly anywhere -- never mind the well-pounded pathway of north to south. In an era of increasingly sophisticated manufacturing that relies more on computers and robotics than low-wage hands, centers of innovation like Canada and the United States will exert a greater pull than before.

This plays well to Mr. Trump's premise that a robust era of American job growth awaits, if only the nation selects a president with the audacity to set aside the niceties of trade agreements and begin acting like a self-interested superpower, dictating the terms of commerce. And it speaks to one group of voters that has embraced him -- dispossessed factory workers prone to blaming globalization for lost jobs, declining wages and financial anxiety. But consider this deal more of a caveat added to the dominant narrative than some revolutionary twist to the story of globalization. Making dash mats at a plant in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Donald J. Trump has vowed to pull jobs back to America from Mexico. ""You can bring some jobs back, but they will likely be more of a drip than a big flow,"" said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economic adviser in the Obama administration, and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. ""Trump has a very nostalgic view of globalization, circa 1950."" ""Broadly speaking, the trends that have hurt communities here in terms of trade and trade deficits are very much ongoing, and if that gets turned around, it's not going to be about bringing all the old jobs back,"" he said. ""It's going to be about forging new sectors like advanced manufacturing.""

Which is to say, sectors where a handful of highly skilled people with degrees and technical prowess earn a good deal of money. And lesser-educated workers -- the ones who lost jobs to China and Mexico and are now embracing Mr. Trump -- continue to be left behind. Far from representing a reversal of course, the G.M. deal then underscores how multinationals are fine-tuning their approach to making things. They are increasingly differentiating between more labor-intensive manufacturing -- tasks like stitching bluejeans and snapping together cellphone cases -- and more advanced, machine-intensive pursuits that rely on automation and software. Given that state-of-the-art products fetch a higher price, it is presumably worth paying a premium to the limited numbers of humans involved in their creation -- and especially since this buys proximity to the minds that dream up lucrative new visions. The Canadian plant getting the jobs sits near Waterloo, the birthplace of the BlackBerry, which is something like Canada's Silicon Valley. The union in Canada won something headline-grabbing -- jobs retrieved from Mexico. But it also relented on a major objective sought by G.M.: Workers gave up the fight to retain old-fashioned pensions that pay out fixed amounts. They accepted newfangled plans that see benefits fluctuate with the markets.

Far from proof that Canadian workers have somehow recaptured the upper hand in jockeying for the spoils of globalization, this deal is just the latest evidence that companies have effectively used international factories to permanently tilt the power dynamics in their favor. For decades, global automakers have been on the march for lower costs. In the United States, they shifted factories from union strongholds like Michigan and Wisconsin to Southern states like South Carolina and Alabama, where union ranks were weak and local rules limited labor organizing.

Then, they kept moving south, to Mexico, exploiting a series of trade deals -- not least the North American Free Trade Agreement. A quarter century ago, the then-American presidential candidate, Ross Perot, spoke of a ""giant sucking sound"" in warning that factory work was being vacuumed up by Mexico, with American communities abandoned. For workers in Canada and Mexico, the impacts were evident. They had to satisfy the demands of auto manufacturers locked in an increasingly global competition. They had to make concessions. Otherwise, the car companies could employ their demonstrated power to leave them behind, moving the work to places where labor was cheaper and more pliable. The G.M. deal affirms this reality. Labor paid a price for gaining jobs in Canada -- downgraded retirement. Above all, the deal underscores the potency of markets in shaping what happens in commercial life, a force far more powerful than demagogues making dubious promises about tearing up trade deals."
60121,"A Homeowner With No Savings, but Some Options","Susanna Wilson, 70 and with no savings, is afraid she will never be able to retire. A financial planner suggests a risky solution: a reverse mortgage.","Susanna Wilson, 70, makes little girls' dresses to supplement a meager Social Security check.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/your-money/RURAL/RURAL-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=135bc3920aa5c92d4dbb721c0e44504297b9db4211ff7a53525126d01d4c9640&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/your-money/24RURAL.html,1c8173ad-9a9d-5176-acc7-7081043a2f88.jpg,"I F you're worried that you haven't saved enough for retirement, you're probably right. Most of us haven't. In fact, the Employee Benefit Research Institute found the majority of American workers had put away less than $25,000 for their golden years. But even those people are in better financial shape than Susanna Wilson, 70, who saved nothing. Her only dependable income is a Social Security check of about $900 a month. ""I can never retire,"" she said, her voice trembling as she stared at the floor of her living room in Grass Valley, Calif. ""Probably about every two weeks when the bills are due, that's when I get really worried. I think 'How am I going to pay this one?' "" It should never have come to this. Ms. Wilson attended the University of California, Berkeley, in the late 1950s, though she left before graduating to move to New York and marry her college sweetheart, the Minimalist sculptor and sometime rock musician Walter De Maria.

Ms. Wilson spent her prime earning years engaged in various creative endeavors in New York, mostly as a designer. Her clothing line, O'Susanna, found a home in the late 1970s at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's. Glamour and Seventeen magazines featured Perfumes by Susanna, including a popular fragrance called Strawberry Love. In her 40s, Ms. Wilson moved to California and became a publicist. At her peak, she made around $65,000 a year, she said, and not a penny of that made its way into a retirement fund. ""One thing kind of led to another,"" Ms. Wilson said. ""I've always put all my money into my businesses. And I always thought the business I was in was going to be a great success."" She also raised a daughter, Corie, 36, who lives in Los Angeles with her two children and is not in a position to help her mother financially. Now twice divorced and living alone with her Shetland Sheepdog, Rooney, Ms. Wilson subsists on those government checks, plus a one-day-a-week job at a local jewelry store that pays $12.50 an hour. She received no alimony from either divorce. Ms. Wilson also makes little girls' dresses under her O'Susanna label, at a vintage Singer Featherweight sewing machine in her dining room. But she sells only about six a month for around $200. Grass Valley, an old gold mining town of 12,300 residents in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, isn't an expensive place to live. But Ms. Wilson isn't the only one struggling. Her friend Molly Fisk, 55, a poet and teacher, was visiting the house and joked that her retirement planning was ""all tied up in MasterCard futures. Sad but true."" Ms. Wilson would probably manage on her current income, though not without sacrifice, were it not for the debt she had accumulated. All told, she averages about $1,400 in monthly income, including Social Security (adjusted for one of her former husbands' earnings). A third of that goes toward fixed expenses like utilities. She pays $300 toward a mortgage balance of $5,477. She inherited the house, fully paid off, from her parents, but took out the mortgage a few years ago to pay for repairs.

The balance of her income goes toward the monthly minimum payments on $9,000 in credit card debt, racked up for daily living expenses. ""I think I might just have to declare bankruptcy,"" she said. ""I just can't live with that."" Before she takes that drastic step, Ms. Wilson should consider some other options, said Elizabeth Rutter Baer, a certified financial planner in Lansing, Mich. She worries that Ms. Wilson is ""extremely close"" to the edge and isn't getting anywhere with her debt payments because she keeps putting more expenses, like food, on her credit cards. Yes, she could try to find other income, Ms. Baer said. But that's a short-term solution. At some point, despite her excellent health, Ms. Wilson may not be able to work. ""Bankruptcy is possible, but my advice is, let's liquidate assets and get those debts paid off,"" Ms. Baer said. To that end, Ms. Baer recommended something she said she had never before suggested: a reverse mortgage. Such mortgages allow homeowners to tap existing home equity to receive a lump sum or monthly checks. Unlike a home equity loan, however, borrowers don't have to make any repayments until they no longer live in the home. The strategy can be risky, with high fees and sometimes poor counseling for borrowers. Reverse mortgages are available only to homeowners 62 or older. ""Susanna is the ideal candidate,"" Ms. Baer said. ""This is one instance where it could work."" The house is valued from $150,000 to $200,000. Ms. Baer said Ms. Wilson should work with a bank to see if she could wrap the current mortgage into a reverse and then take cash out. Ms. Wilson is already making phone calls to explore the idea. Ms. Baer also noted that Ms. Wilson was part owner, with her two brothers, of several tracts of timberland in northern California. The land's value has dropped because of the economy, but Ms. Baer said that shouldn't stop them from selling it. ""Whatever the purpose of this land was before, today's the rainy day,"" she said. ""It may not be that much, but at this point $25,000 would change her life, totally."" Ms. Wilson said she was discussing this with her brothers and a real estate agent."
3748,"Without Places to Gather, Debut Novelists Reimagine Book Promotion",First-time novelists with books out or coming soon talk about their changes of plans and how they're spending these unusual days.,From left: Hilary Leichter; Gabriel Bump; Celia Laskey; <br />Emily Nemens,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/16/books/16DEBUTS-GRID/16DEBUTS-GRID-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c773eff30bb9edf6d05447b4f153632624f45e232bcffc7d82361b1d0f7b48d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/books/debut-novels-book-tours.html,b7d0b797-12a1-5c13-a4ad-10f079dbe6fc.jpg,"For many first-time novelists, years of hard work (and often solitary time) culminate in seeing their book come into the world: going to festivals and bookstores to read sections aloud and connecting with readers face to face, inhabiting with others the worlds they built. But with social distancing guidelines discouraging gatherings of more than 10 people, publishing a debut has changed in ways that authors couldn't have foreseen just a few weeks ago. We spoke to several debut novelists about their books, their plans to promote their work and their days during this unusual time. My book is a dark comedy about a young man, Claude McKay Love, coming of age on Chicago's South Side, trying to navigate universal teenager angst while dealing with societal pressures. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I spent most of February touring and giving interviews. I was supposed to go on my final leg this upcoming week. By last Wednesday, as the severity of this situation clarified, after a few events canceled, we decided to cancel everything. It seemed silly to put people at risk of contracting and spreading the disease for a reading.

How are you spending it now? Now, my class at University at Buffalo has moved online. I also teach writing classes at Just Buffalo Literary Center. They've wisely closed. Until further notice, I'm hunkered down with my girlfriend, our dog and cat, video games, movies, writing projects and books. I'm editing my second novel. It's about an underground society that forms because America and the world are crumbling. Coming back to that work during these times is, well, surreal. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? Publishing and promoting a book is a stressful, maddening, exhausting, anxiety-inducing and wonderful process. This book has taken up almost all my head space the past few months. It was the most important thing to me. This crisis has brought me back to reality. I'm no longer afraid of bad reviews, empty readings or a lukewarm reception. I'm afraid for the world. I also feel a deeper appreciation for literature's ability to transport us away from the present. ""The Cactus League"" is a community novel that charts the path of Jason Goodyear, the Los Angeles Lions' fantastic but flawed left fielder, as the Lions make their way through spring training in Scottsdale, Ariz. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? My publicist and I worked together to build out an ambitious schedule of events at independent bookstores, schools and festivals, with the understanding that those readings and conversations really do sell books.

I was fortunate to complete the first half of my tour in February -- though I was in several Covid-19 hot spots, including Seattle, just days before the outbreak was detected there, and those happy, carefree -- and crowded -- gatherings now seem a bit ominous. I had a second leg charted -- visiting spring training and the Tucson Book Festival, then speaking to several university writing programs, including my graduate alma mater, Louisiana State University. I was supposed to be watching a Brewers spring training game right now! How are you spending it now? I'm trying to book podcast and radio interviews as much as I can, and I'm being pretty emphatic on social media about supporting not just my novel but all debut writers and independent bookstores (book events are a major driver of sales for them, too). I'm also spending a lot of time on triage at work -- by day I run The Paris Review. Making sure my colleagues were safe and healthy and ready to go remote, and postponing our 400-person awards dinner and fund-raiser, also have kept me plenty busy. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? I'd love to plug the new website bookshop.org. You can order online, but the sales are fulfilled by indies, based on your geography. It just launched -- in the nick of time. My debut novel, ""Temporary,"" is the story of a temporary worker who is assigned a series of surreal and improbable jobs on her quest for permanence -- she works as a pirate, an assassin, a ghost and even a bank robber. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I am a former theater kid, and a well-known ham, so more than anything I was looking forward to putting on a show. I think that when readers trek out to a book event, it's such a great way of saying ""thank you"" to do something a little bit different than a straightforward reading. For the Brooklyn launch, I had planned a performance of several sections of my novel, with a Greek chorus of readers, including the author Diane Cook, and the writer and podcast host Dennis Norris II. Coffee House Press, Emily Books and I had put together a tour of about 17 events in 12 different cities around the country.

I was devastated to see these events disappear. It took so much time and care to put a tour together. I have been saving airline miles and taking on extra work for years to make it possible. My family has been planning to come to New York for months, and after they canceled their flights (the right decision), I spent a good hour crying and watching ""Love Is Blind."" Writing a book can be incredibly lonely, and I was so looking forward to the chance to share it with the people I love and admire, in person. How are you spending it now? Books Are Magic was set to host my book launch on Friday, March 13 (I know, I know). In the face of everything happening in the world, and after obsessively refreshing Twitter, it became clear that the events around my book were kaput. And then! The writer and bookstore owner Emma Straub had me and my editor, Emily Gould, stop by the store yesterday to film a short Q. and A. for Instagram. They even let me sing a couple of songs on my ukulele. And yesterday evening, my husband, along with the debut author Emma Copley Eisenberg, hosted a surprise digital book launch over Zoom. There were so many friends from near and far, and my mom was even able to join the video! People were on the chat with their babies, their toddlers, their dogs. Whole families were able to attend! There were old friends from high school and college, and friends from Twitter and the writing world who I have still never met in real life. It was incredibly moving. I had had a glass of wine, and so the evening ended with some vocal stylings, impressions of Idina Menzel and Audra McDonald, and a group rendition of ""So Long, Farewell"" from ""The Sound of Music."" That's something that never would have happened at a live event. It had a different, cozy energy, kind of like a literary sleepover.

""Under the Rainbow"" is about what happens when a queer task force is sent into the most homophobic town in America. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I had a launch event on March 10 that was quite sparsely attended, and I was supposed to be a panelist at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books in April, which was just moved to the fall. I have another April event called Literary Orange that I suspect will be canceled, and even if it isn't, I don't think I'll feel comfortable attending. How are you spending it now? At home, anxious in old pajamas, which is basically my default setting! I'm spending a lot of time on Twitter and Instagram, trying to interact with people who are willing to amplify books coming out right now. Is there anything else you want to add or has been on your mind in connection with this? I think certain themes from my novel could really resonate with people right now: being trapped in a place you don't want to be (the most homophobic town in America, your tiny apartment), disruption of the status quo. Individual people are doing a lot to help -- next week I'm going on the Debutiful podcast for what the host is calling a Virtual Book Tour episode that will work just like a tour event, with a short reading followed by questions about the book. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book?

Definitely been a hard hit, especially this being my first novel -- I wanted to go all out. I was going to the A.W.P. conference in San Antonio to be part of two panels there. For the book release, I was going to do a church drag show. And then I thought, I didn't want my book to have the pandemic looming over it. We could have gone through with it, but I didn't want that looming over it. I wanted it to be something celebratory. I was going to fly to L.A. next week and do two events there, and then the San Antonio Book Festival. I still have my ticket to go to New York mid-April, but am going to reassess. How are you spending it now? Yesterday, when I announced that I wasn't going to do the event here and was canceling the rest of the California tour, some people started reaching out to me. Friends with different skills asking if I wanted do a live reading, to video myself and post it on different sites. What's been happening today is reimagining what it will look like, mainly through the internet. It's not ideal, because I like seeing and hearing people, touching people, doing something live. The feeling is different. But it's about the circumstances and accepting what you can't control. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? A lot of the queer community is talking about elders and H.I.V., how to really tap into resources for folks that actually need them. And having conversations about how the queer community went through something like this, and we have avenues of how to deal with this. People are asking for people's Venmos, donating $50 or $100 to folks -- some underground economy starting. ""New Waves"" is a novel about how work culture bleeds into how we approach all the things in our personal life -- grief, racism, the internet, etc. It's funnier than how I just made it sound, though.

How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I had a launch event at Books Are Magic, which had a really great turnout. At drinks afterward, a running theme was: ""This is the last time I'm going out for a while."" So I'm lucky that for pub day, I had a crowd of friends, family and strangers that felt celebratory. The rest of my tour will likely be postponed. It's disappointing, but there are larger things at stake than my in-your-feelings literary novel. How are you spending it now? Mostly texting and DMing with other writers who had books coming out around now. There are some people who are really crushed. I'm also on a handful of email threads with other authors -- most of whom I've never met, just people who are in the same boat. A sinking tide bums out all boats, I guess. I'm trying to figure out some more creative ways to keep up the energy around my book and others that dropped in the past few weeks. Everyone keeps suggesting doing livestreams in lieu of the events that have been canceled. I don't think it's a terrible idea, but I'm not entirely confident that these are ways people want to experience readings. There might be an upside, though: I think it may push authors and editors to think of creative, ambitious ways to do digital projects. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? A lot of the authors, publicists and editors I've talked to feel defeated by the circumstances. I get it. I'm definitely discouraged a bit, too. But there's an opportunity here, if we can all figure it out. The reality is that book events, while still effective in some ways, are becoming increasingly irrelevant. Which makes sense. Reading is a private, intimate act. Book tours have been a way to try and make these things social. (How many events do you go to that feel like they drag on for too long?) They're also expensive, and unless you're one of a handful of already well-established authors, publishers are seeing them as an expense with very little return. I'm hoping these hurdles encourage us to think about how book promotion can be reinvented.

""The Mountains Sing"" is a journey into Vietnam's 20th-century history via the lives of four generations of the Tran family. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? My publisher and I, as well as independent bookstores, several universities and cultural organizations worked for months together to develop a very exciting book tour which would take me to meet readers in many cities. I have my tickets to fly all the way from Indonesia, where I am currently based, to the United States. I planned to present my book in unique Vietnamese ways, including singing and performances. I had my ao dai dresses tailor-made for the events. I was very looking forward to conversations with writers whom I most admire, including Viet Thanh Nguyen, Thi Bui, Isabelle Thuy Pelaud, Wayne Karlin, Madeleine Thien, Karl Marlantes and Ethelbert Miller, and I am devastated the book tour has been canceled. How are you spending it now? I am searching for online ways to interact with readers, via social media and press interviews. According to the Vietnamese saying, ""trong cai rui co cai may -- good luck hides inside bad luck,"" this difficult time reveals the amazing and supportive spirit of the literary community. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? I fought my whole life to be able to become a writer, and now I need to fight against the coronavirus situation for my debut novel in English to reach readers' hands. My heart goes out to everyone who has been affected by this calamity. Amid all this, there is a need to keep the book business afloat by lending a hand to indie booksellers, publishers, authors. Books help keep us calm and are essential during this time of social distancing. For those reasons, I will be buying as many books released this month and next month as I can.

""Lakewood"" is about a young black woman who joins a government-sponsored research study in an attempt to pay off her family's debts. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? I was scheduled to go to several independent bookstores, read at some university-sponsored events, talk at a high school, go to Booktopia (a small literary festival in Vermont this year) and give craft talks for organizations like Literary Cleveland. How are you spending it now? I'm working with some other writers to possibly do some digital readings via Instagram Live. I'll still be on some podcasts and guest-editing some Instagram feeds. I'm going to Skype into some book clubs. We're trying to reschedule book tour stuff for late April, early May, but that feels optimistic. I'm worried about the independent bookstores that are impacted by this. A lot of them have been incredible advocates for me and ""Lakewood."" I'll probably spend way more of this time encouraging friends and family to buy my book, any book, from them via online sales. Before, I would've been telling people to come out and get into the stores. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? One thing that has changed during book promotion for me is that at the beginning of it, the majority of people wanted to talk to me about race and the implications of it in ""Lakewood."" A lot of comparisons to ""Get Out"" were made. Now, because so much of the book's plot speaks toward economic inequities, toward the deep inequity in the U.S. health care system, we're now talking about how uncomfortably relatable the book has become to many more people due to Covid-19. The only positive I can take at the moment from this pandemic is that maybe it will help the unconvinced understand how cruel it is not to have easily accessible and affordable health care. It's about an Iranian bus driver in Tehran who reluctantly gets involved in politics and pays a heavy price, getting thrown into jail because he attended a strike organized by a union and spending a lot of time in solitary confinement.

How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? We had a few events lined up. The book launch was March 24, scheduled to be at the Center for Fiction, and I was excited to be in conversation with Shirin Neshat, the Iranian visual artist and filmmaker. Then I was heading to Australia in late April for the Sydney Writers' Festival (which is canceled, too), and then another festival in New Jersey. It was about half a dozen events, all of them canceled. Some postponed -- well, hopefully all postponed. Then there is the baby my wife just had yesterday, who was overdue, a week after due date. I was looking forward to the birth of these two things, one human, one book. One born all right, the other one ... facing a lot issues. How are you spending it now? I'll still be doing an NPR interview. To be honest with you, I'm so preoccupied with the baby that I don't care very much at the moment. It's kind of a blessing in disguise. I was concerned that I would be away from my family, and it's nice to be with them. I also teach at CUNY in Harlem. Those classes are also canceled. It's weird to think -- it feels like everything was put on hold as soon as he was born. Is there anything else you want to add or that's been on your mind in connection with this? I don't really know. It's a very weird coincidence. To have your life, all of these events of intensity meeting at one point within the span of a couple days. It's very complicated. I haven't really thought through it that much yet. If you have any kind of belief in the fact that no coincidence is entirely coincidental, then this is good material for obsessive thinking. ""Catherine House"" is a gothic literary suspense novel set at a mysterious cultlike college with a dangerous secret agenda. How were you planning to spend your time promoting and talking about your book? We were planning to do podcasts and interviews, book giveaways, social media pushes, bookseller dinners, media events and, of course, launch events at bookstores when it comes out."

In an interview here, the vice president of Indonesia characterized higher interest rates and a weakened currency as the ""new normal."" Boediono, the country's vice president, who uses only one name, said that Indonesia would face a tougher international financial environment in the coming months and should give greater emphasis to a stable currency, stable prices and a stable trade balance and not just pursue economic growth. ""We have been addicted, so to speak, with an easy-money environment for four years,"" said Mr. Boediono, the main architect of Indonesian economic policy since the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998. ""We know that we have to make some adjustments, and maybe by next year, we have to really, fully adjust to a new normal, so to speak, where easy money is no longer"" available. But in Mumbai, the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India suggested that India faced less of an international threat after the Federal Reserve decided on Wednesday to continue its economic stimulus, at least temporarily. The governor, Raghuram Rajan, lowered a key interest rate on Friday by three-quarters of a percent, although he raised another less important rate by a quarter of a percent.

India pushed interest rates up sharply over the summer to make financial investments there more attractive and slow the fall of the rupee. Reversing part of that increase now ""will provide a boost to growth, reduce the financing distortions that are emerging in the market, and reduce the strain on corporate and bank balance sheets,"" Raghuram Rajan, the new governor, said Friday at his first news conference on monetary policy. In monetary terms, India is zigging while Indonesia is zagging, despite the many common challenges that have pummeled their currencies and stock markets in recent weeks. Both must balance a need to preserve economic growth for large, heavily poor populations, while at the same time preventing a buildup of inflation that might discourage longer-term investments -- a tricky balancing act that has bedeviled policy makers in the United States and other affluent countries over the years. India, with a population of about 1.2 billion, and Indonesia, population 250 million, are both struggling to modernize their infrastructure while stuck with complex land ownership laws that make it hard to redevelop cities rapidly. Both are wrestling with costly but politically popular fuel subsidies that are driving up government budget deficits, and both have indignant publics demanding an end to endemic corruption.

But deaths linked to cough syrups in Gambia have brought attention to poor regulations and testing capacities Economically, both have sizable current-account deficits compared to their economic output, together with nearly double-digit inflation in consumer prices. Perhaps most important, both face national elections next year that limit their ability to make politically unappetizing economic decisions: India will elect a new Parliament by the end of May, while Indonesia will elect a new legislature in April and a new president in July.

While Indonesia's ports and highways still have shortcomings, as does the country's bureaucracy, they are good enough that the country has emerged as one destination for the many companies shifting operations away from China in response to surging blue-collar wages there. India's bureaucracy remains stifling, and the potholes and traffic on the country's roads are so bad that vehicles scarcely move faster than walking speed in some areas; in other areas, sometime gruesome crashes are a regular occurrence. Above all, India's is the more fractious democracy. Indonesia gave political independence to its central bank in 1999, right after the Asian financial crisis. The Bank of Indonesia raised short-term interest rates last week, but the country's business community remains supportive -- Sofjan Wanandi, the influential tycoon who is the chairman of the Employers' Association of Indonesia, said in an interview this week that business leaders were ready to pay even higher interest rates as needed to control inflation. By contrast, the Reserve Bank of India is subject to the dictates of the government. The Confederation of Indian Industry, the country's most powerful business group, representing the large companies that tend to receive most of Indian bank loans, has been lobbying heavily in recent weeks for a full cut of one percentage point in lending rates. Emerging markets around the world have seen an exodus of investment, falling currencies and tumbling stock markets since May. That was when the Fed began signaling that it was preparing to start cutting back its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities -- purchases that had helped keep long-term interest rates low. Vice President Boediono of Indonesia, a former finance minister and governor of the central bank, said Friday that the Fed's decision on Wednesday to defer a reduction in economic stimulus offers Indonesia a breathing space but does not remove the necessity for prompt action by policy makers here.

While avoiding specifics, Mr. Boediono appeared to hint that he did not expect recent market shifts to be reversed quickly. He said that Indonesia had to adjust ""interest rates, even our exchange rate, to a new normal."" He called for a series of supply-side measures to address bottlenecks in the economy that could fuel inflation. These measures included easier land acquisition and permits for infrastructure projects as well as a new system of online education that would span Indonesia's huge archipelago, which stretches a similar distance as Seattle to Tampa. ""Work hard on the supply side, then you can achieve a safe level of inflation without having to really tighten your monetary policy with the costs to growth and so on,"" he said. President Xi Jinping of China is scheduled to come to Jakarta next week. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia will hold discussions with him on some issues, including the South China Sea, Mr. Boediono said, declining to elaborate. Mr. Boediono said that he would discuss with President Xi the possibility of expanding the bilateral swap agreement between the two countries, but said that the amount of the expansion had not yet been decided. An expanded agreement would allow Indonesia to borrow more dollars from China if needed to buy rupiah in currency markets someday during another period of exchange rate volatility. Mr. Boediono was elected vice president in the summer of 2009 when President Yudhoyono won a second term. Legislative elections are scheduled for next April and presidential elections for next July; President Yudhoyono is not running for a third five-year term because of term limits. As a technocrat with a limited political base, Mr. Boediono has not been expected to run for president. He said on Friday that he had no desire for public office after his term ends in October next year and hoped to focus on online education thereafter."
27764,'Watchmen' Season 1 Finale Recap: Worthy Adversaries,"Damon Lindelof's provocative ""remix"" of the beloved comic finished the season with confidence, completeness and no shortage of stylistic bravado.","Regina King in a scene from the Season 1 finale of ""Watchmen.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/15/arts/15watchmen-recap/15watchmen-recap-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5ecb1676e5ee4d5e7a70774dd7eba0f0a8c18de0d04cc4c308094ec87ecd852a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/arts/television/watchmen-finale-recap.html,716276db-402f-5005-869e-3ca635d381a5.jpg,"The first feeling after watching the finale of ""Watchmen"" is relief. Whew. Damon Lindelof has flown this plane through heavy turbulence -- and a hailstorm of frozen squid -- and landed it safely, which is no small achievement in itself. It was a crazy idea to riff around the consensus choice for the best graphic novel ever written, and to riff so boldly, too, by rewriting a new racial identity for Hooded Justice and plotting drastically new courses for characters like Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan. (All without Alan Moore's blessing, which he has given to no adaptation of the book.) It was audacious to shift focus from the Cold War and nuclear arms to white supremacy and racism, inviting intense scrutiny from all comers. And so, at a minimum, we can appreciate that Lindelof and company have finished the season with confidence, completeness and no shortage of stylistic bravado. All the major characters have their roles to play, including Adrian Veidt, who had been stranded on a distant moon for eight episodes, and various diabolical plots have been articulated and foiled, which is what superhero stories are supposed to do. There's even a neat little button at the end that either closes the entire series on a note of ambiguity or opens the door for a second season on a cliffhanger. (Lindelof has suggested that another showrunner could pick up where he left off.) Yet the further ""Watchmen"" has gotten from its debut, the more distance it has gotten from the issues that were ostensibly at its heart. Here's a series that started with the Tulsa massacre of 1921 and came back to Tulsa in the present day, suggesting how much the city -- and by extension, America at large -- had been shaped by violent white supremacy. As much as the presence of costumed adventurers had changed history, handing the country a victory (and a 51st state) in Vietnam and extending Richard Nixon's term in office, it wasn't so transformed as to blot out racism. It just appears under a different guise. Or mask.

But after the astonishing sixth episode, ""Watchmen"" has shifted focus away from heroes like Sister Night, Looking Glass and Hooded Justice -- all humans of limited resources and power -- and paid more attention to Ozymandias, Dr. Manhattan and Lady Trieu, who have the ability to alter the course of history all by their lonesome. That's not a mistake on Lindelof's part, and not an unfruitful path to follow. The type of power they have or seek tends to be morally corrosive, whether it's sought by Ozymandias, who seemed to think nothing of sacrificing three million innocent people to save billions more, or Dr. Manhattan, whose decisive role in winning Vietnam came with unintended consequences and who's accused of not doing enough to end starvation or clean up the environment. Handing the finale over to these characters amplifies the spectacle because they can change the world in a second, but it minimizes the century-long quest for racial justice that initially drove the show. Lindelof and his co-writer, Nick Cuse, seem aware of it enough to turn the Cyclops master plan into a feckless joke. Senator Keene's father, who drafted the bill that banned vigilantism by costumed adventurers, sending many of them into retirement or government work, turns up to see his preening son become a white supremacist superhero. He's joined by Jane Crawford and several pews full of witnesses and Seventh Kavalry goons, but from the moment Keene Jr. strips down to his skivvies and delivers his supervillain speech, it's clear that his comeuppance is nigh. The speed with which they're dispatched by Lady Trieu -- Keene liquefied in the chamber, the entire Seventh Kavalry zapped like bugs at a barbecue -- calls their ""supremacy"" into question. The real battle in the finale takes place between ""worthy adversaries,"" Trieu and Veidt, two characters with big brains, bottomless wallets and the arrogance to believe they can rule the world. Their stories connect through Trieu's origins as Sample #2346 in Veidt's secret sperm bank, hidden behind an Alexander the Great painting, which her mother raids in 1985. Questions that were teased out in previous episodes get answered, like what Trieu intends to do with that mysterious device she's been building and who Veidt was signaling with that gruesome arrangement of bodies on some distant moon. Between Trieu's quantum centrifuge, the teleportation device and the special cell designed to hold Dr. Manhattan, the powers of a God are suddenly accessible to multiple parties. The ""Watchmen"" finale gets around to a point that it happens to share with the ""Silicon Valley"" season finale last week: One person shouldn't have enough power to change the world alone, even if his or her intentions are good. Trieu does get to give a big, satisfying speech to the leaders of Cyclops before wiping them out -- or most of the speech, anyway -- but when she steps into that chamber, ready to absorb Dr. Manhattan's essence, she's just another narcissist and megalomaniac whose powers are not to be trusted. When Dr. Manhattan exiles himself to Mars in the comic, with his line about how he's tired of humanity, ""of being caught in the tangle of their lives,"" he is also acknowledging his own limitations as an agent of change. That's the thinking behind Laurie Blake's ""joke"" about the heroes meeting God at the Pearly Gates: that they're all doomed to fall short of their ideals and perhaps make some catastrophic mistakes in the process.

This final episode may fall short in following through on the racial themes it introduced at the start, but it does circle back to Bass Reeves and ""trust in the law."" When Cyclops and Trieu are eradicated, and Dr. Manhattan's powers seemingly die with him, Laurie gets to arrest Veidt for dropping the squid on New York, which is our first glimpse of a recognizable, human-scale form of justice. No masks, no righteous vigilantism, no superpowers. Just the transparent business of applying the law, which is of course fraught with its own potential for abuse and corruption, but is preferable to the alternative. Which brings us to the cliffhanger that ends the season -- and perhaps the series. The show has not been subtle about the egg as an important symbol, and it leaves Abar contemplating one that may contain the essence of Dr. Manhattan's powers, which are now hers to claim. Given the themes of the episode, it's surprising that the cliffhanger isn't whether she destroys the egg or consumes it. It's about whether the transformation actually works or not. That's an answer another season can take up, but Lindelof is ending with a point about hubris. Like Dr. Manhattan, like Lady Trieu, like Adrian Veidt, and like all the costumed adventurers, Abar believes that she can do better. Not likely.
* None Veidt's jab at President Redford for not returning his calls (""Ha, as if some cowboy actor could retain the presidency"") seems like a nod to Christopher Lloyd's mad scientist in ""Back to the Future"" after he's told that Ronald Reagan is president in 1985. (""Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis?"")
* None It's not worth thinking through the long game Trieu and her mother -- and the clone of her mother, who is her daughter -- are playing with Veidt. But it does bring new meaning to the Monty Python number ""Every Sperm Is Sacred.""
* None One advantage of having a son instead of a daughter: Much easier to spell out an S.O.S. message in clone corpses.
* None Another practical takeaway from this episode: Never absorb atomic energy without filtering it first.
* None The rush to the finish didn't allow for a more satisfying exchange between Veidt and Looking Glass, whose entire life has been defined by the squid that Veidt dropped in New York. Then again, ""I saved humanity, you ignorant hayseed"" may be all that needed to be said."
43323,A Backlash Builds Against Sexual Harassment in Silicon Valley,A wave of revelations about investors mistreating female entrepreneurs has spurred the resignation of a prominent venture capitalist and calls for change.,"Dave McClure, the founder of 500 Startups, resigned on Monday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/04/business/04HARASS2/04HARASS2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d64b15918280bd20742968f773ca46ab19f1a1695c81d06dc30e1d29cb91561e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/technology/silicon-valley-sexual-harassment.html,abe575af-f0c4-54c3-aea2-15077b1a3385.jpg,"The upheaval over sexual harassment in the technology start-up industry mushroomed on Monday, with the resignation of a prominent Silicon Valley investor who said he had been ""a creep"" and more women saying they would come forward to talk about their experiences. Dave McClure, the founder of the start-up incubator 500 Startups, said he was stepping down on Monday after The New York Times reported last week that he had come on to a woman who was applying for a job at his firm. Mr. McClure apologized for his behavior over the weekend, in a post titled ""I'm a creep. I'm sorry."" Another partner at 500 Startups, Elizabeth Yin, also resigned this weekend, saying that she was quitting after the firm had covered up a separate harassment episode by Mr. McClure. Several other start-up investors have also issued mea culpas for not doing enough to prevent sexual harassment, with some around the world beginning to strategize over how to avert the episodes in the first place. The New England Venture Capital Association, a trade group, last week invited its members to sign an anti-discrimination and sexual harassment statement. In Australia, start-up entrepreneurs also issued a statement condemning the behavior. And women entrepreneurs, emboldened by the support, have over the last few days become more willing to share their stories.

""Women are more empowered than ever to not tolerate these things,"" said Sarah Kunst, chief executive of the fitness start-up Proday, who was propositioned by Mr. McClure after he had begun talking with her about a possible role at 500 Startups. Ms. Kunst said there were now ""countless discussions"" among women about speaking publicly about their experiences and how to end the behavior. The furor follows a string of revelations about how venture capitalists have mistreated women entrepreneurs over the years, an issue that was in the past largely swept under the carpet. The disclosures gained momentum after the implosion last month of a small venture firm, Binary Capital, whose partner, Justin Caldbeck, apologized to women after several spoke on the record about his behavior. The Times also spoke to more than two dozen female entrepreneurs who described unwanted advances, touching and sexist comments by investors. For years, the start-up and venture capital industry -- which is predominantly male -- has been immune to criticism about its behavior because the industry has created immense wealth by churning out hit companies, such as Facebook, Snap and Uber. The backlash now suggests that those successes are no longer enough to excuse the anything-goes conduct of some investors and entrepreneurs. With more women willing to speak openly about harassment and discrimination, Kate Mitchell, a founder of a Silicon Valley venture firm, Scale Venture Partners, said the industry was facing ""a tipping point."" ""The fact this behavior is pervasive and what we know seems to be the tip of the iceberg has made us understand the difficulty and reality of our challenge,"" Ms. Mitchell said. ""Actions need to be more aggressive and more all encompassing than what I previously thought.""

But even as the movement to grapple with harassment gathers momentum, some venture capital firms are privately grumbling about having to deal with the issue, said some investors. ""Some men have the feeling that the conversation has turned into a witch hunt,"" said Aileen Lee, a founder of Cowboy Ventures. ""They're asking when people will stop being outed."" That attitude belies a lack of understanding about the issue, said some entrepreneurs. Even though ""we've accepted why it's so important for a boss to not hit on someone who reports to him, many people still don't understand that those same power dynamics play out when founders seek to network or raise money,"" said Kathryn Minshew, the founder of the Muse, a company that helps millennials find jobs. A few years ago, Ms. Minshew told Wired about how she had been treated in the start-up ecosystem. Over the last week, she also told The Times that she had been harassed by male investors -- whom she did not name -- on multiple occasions. Sarah Kunst, chief executive of the fitness start-up Proday, had been propositioned by Mr. McClure. In one instance, she met an investor at a conference and set up a time to discuss her company. That day, the investor's assistant said he needed to move the meeting to the evening. At the meeting, he got very close to Ms. Minshew and put his arm around her. In another instance, an investor suggested the two sleep together after his firm had signed an agreement to invest in Ms. Minshew's company, but before the cash was in the bank. She was unable to accept his money after that episode, which jeopardized her ability to fund her company. ""It feels like the industry's acceptance and tolerance of this behavior is changing,"" Ms. Minshew said. ""I really appreciate how people in the industry are standing up and saying no, this isn't O.K.""

At 500 Startups, Mr. McClure's resignation was spurred not only by Ms. Kunst's coming forward, but by a separate internal report this April that said he had sexually assaulted an employee, according to a resignation letter by Ms. Yin, the 500 Startups' partner who stepped down over the weekend. Her letter was obtained by The Times. The sexual assault claim moved 500 Startups' management to remove Mr. McClure from day-to-day operations of the firm in May, according to Ms. Yin's letter. But employees were told the change happened because of growth issues, according to the letter. Mr. McClure continued to be active in the company's Slack channels, weighing in on firm decisions, according to screenshots of the conversations that were reviewed by The Times. After The Times reported on Mr. McClure last week, he wrote on the 500 Startups' Slack channels that he had ""not assaulted anyone (that I'm aware of)."" Aman Verjee, the chief operating officer of 500 Startups, also told colleagues and employees that there had been ""no formal finding of harassment"" and ""no legal complaint against 500 or Dave."" Investors in 500 Startups were not alerted to the change in management at the incubator until after The Times published the information on Mr. McClure and Ms. Kunst, according to Brad Feld, an investor in 500 Startups. The firm also said on Friday in an email to investors, which was obtained by The Times, that Mr. McClure ""will continue to be a significant contributor to the future success of 500."" On Saturday, Mr. McClure posted his public apology. ""My behavior was inexcusable and wrong,"" he wrote. But that day, the firm's leaders held a heated phone conversation, in which Mr. McClure admitted to initiating unwanted physical contact with the unidentified employee, according to Ms. Yin's letter. Ms. Yin declined to comment. Mr. McClure did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Axios earlier reported Ms. Yin's letter."

The streaming giant, which has roots in Silicon Valley, has tried to appease its top-shelf directors as it expands further into the movie business. But when it came to a wide theatrical release for ""The Irishman,"" the $159 million gangster epic from the director Martin Scorsese, Netflix fell short.

Netflix announced its fall releases on Tuesday with ""The Irishman"" set to debut in select theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Nov. 1 and then opening in theaters in cities across the country and internationally later that month. It will be available on Netflix on Nov. 27, the announcement said.

The main issue is theatrical exclusivity and when the film would be available on Netflix. The major chains wanted ""The Irishman"" to be seen only in theaters for a longer period than Netflix was willing to accept.

With three and a half weeks of theatrical exclusivity, the rollout of the Scorsese film is similar to the modest theatrical run for ""Roma,"" Netflix's 2018 film from the director Alfonso Cuaron, which won three Oscars."

More than three million people filed for unemployment benefits last week, sending a collective shudder throughout the economy that is unlike anything Americans have experienced. The alarming numbers, in a report released by the Labor Department on Thursday, provide some of the first hard data on the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, which has shut down whole swaths of American life faster than government statistics can keep track. Just three weeks ago, barely 200,000 people applied for jobless benefits, a historically low number. In the half-century that the government has tracked applications, the worst week ever, with 695,000 so-called initial claims, had been in 1982.

The numbers provided only the first hint of the economic cataclysm in progress. Even comparatively optimistic forecasters expect millions more lost jobs, and with them foreclosures, evictions and bankruptcies. Thousands of businesses have closed in response to the pandemic, and many will never reopen. Some economists say the decline in gross domestic product this year could rival the worst years of the Great Depression. And there was fresh evidence on Thursday of the relentless course of the virus itself. Cases in the United States now exceed 80,000, the most of any nation, even China and Italy, according to a New York Times database, and more than 1,000 deaths across the country have been linked to the virus. At least 160 million people nationwide have been ordered to stay home. Many hospitals are overwhelmed, while essential protective gear is in short supply. ""We are the new global epicenter of the disease,"" said Dr. Sara Keller, an infectious-disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Medicine. ""Now all we can do is to slow the transmission as much as possible."" The situation in the New Orleans area is particularly acute, with the city reporting more than 800 cases, a higher total than most states.

In New York, the state hardest hit, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reported a 40 percent increase in hospitalized patients in one day, to well over 5,000. The surge dashed hopes that had been raised a day before, when Mr. Cuomo said the state's social-distancing measures seemed to be slowing the growth in hospitalizations.

The terrifying speed of the U.S. economic collapse from the pandemic has spurred lawmakers to action. Late Wednesday night, senators agreed on a $2 trillion aid package that would provide cash payments to nearly all Americans and would expand the unemployment system, among other changes. Final congressional approval is expected on Friday. The legislative action has helped buoy financial markets. A three-day rally has lifted stocks in the S&P 500 index more than 17 percent, including a rise of 6.2 percent on Thursday, though prices remain far lower than they were a month ago. As staggering as the figures are for jobless claims, they almost certainly understate the problem. Some part-time and low-wage workers don't qualify for unemployment benefits. Nor do gig workers, independent contractors and the self-employed, although the emergency aid package passed by the Senate would broaden eligibility to include many of them. Others who do qualify may not know it. And the sudden rush of layoffs led to jammed phone lines and overwhelmed computer servers at unemployment offices across the country, leaving many people unable to file claims. The evening that Elise Quivey, 25, heard she was being furloughed from her job in Chicago as a web designer for a cruise ship company, she immediately clicked on the state's unemployment benefits website. The pages wouldn't load. The next morning, as she tried to fill out the online form, error messages kept flashing.

Days of calling have resulted in nagging busy signals. She is hoping that her claim made it through, and that she will receive aid within a few weeks, but she is not optimistic. ""There's so many things up in the air right now, and it's so stressful,"" she said. ""It's a wreck."" Despite the glitches, Thursday's figures suggest the scale of the problem. In a single week, the pandemic wiped out a year and a half of job gains. The past two weeks' claims alone would be enough to push the unemployment rate up to 5.7 percent from 3.5 percent in February -- a half-century low that now seems like ancient history. The worst could be yet to come. Mr. Herzon of IHS Markit said he expected a similarly large number next Thursday, when the Labor Department releases its report on new claims filed this week. Some forecasters think the unemployment rate could hit 10 percent this summer, which would equal the highest level from the last recession more than a decade ago. Back then, it took nearly two years for the jobless rate to reach that height. ""What is really hard to fathom is just how fast these numbers are going to escalate,"" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. Still, while there is little doubt that the numbers will get worse in the short term, some economists remain optimistic that the pain will be relatively short-lived. The congressional relief package is intended to, in effect, press ""pause"" on the economy, allowing idled workers and shuttered businesses to keep paying their bills so that they can spring back quickly once the health crisis eases. If it works, the recovery could be relatively swift; if it doesn't, the cascade of layoffs and business failures could stretch on far longer. Quintina Moore-Caraway, a ramp agent at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, was at work on March 13 when her supervisor called her over. She was being furloughed, without pay, at the end of her shift.

Ms. Moore-Caraway, 46, was barely getting by on the $10 an hour she earned at the airport. She has no savings, and no idea how she will pay her $688 rent bill on April 1. She hasn't been in the job long enough to qualify for unemployment, and the few places still hiring during the pandemic aren't near bus routes. ""Through all the hurricanes, floods, I've never seen anything like this,"" she said. ""On the movies I have, not in real life."" Low-wage workers -- many of them black, like Ms. Moore-Caraway, or Hispanic -- have been hit especially hard by the sudden economic reversal. Many work in the industries most affected by the outbreak, such as restaurants and travel, and few can work from home. They are also less likely to have sick leave or other paid time off, and they have less money saved to help overcome a missed paycheck. Black and Hispanic workers ""always bear the brunt"" of economic slowdowns, said Alix Gould-Werth, a researcher at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-leaning think tank. ""Now they're bearing the brunt of these twin crises, the health crisis and the economic crisis.""

""Where we maybe had eight months to prepare heading into the recession, we had five days to respond to coronavirus,"" said Cher Haavind, the department's deputy executive director. On Monday, nearly 100,000 call attempts were made by 10 a.m., when the call center normally receives 6,000 calls in an entire week. The department put in place a new process under which those filing claims submit their forms at specified times based on their last names. Even so, Ms. Haavind said, the crush of applications has strained not just the department's systems but also its employees.

""They are talking to stressed-out people, and they are also stressed out,"" she said. For laid-off workers, the anxiety is racking. Mere weeks ago, Bill Copperfield had steady work installing drywall in commercial buildings in Hawaii. Then he caught a cold and, in the suddenly cautious world of coronavirus, was told not to come to work, meaning he wasn't paid. By the time he was healthy again, the job had shut down and the state government was telling nonessential workers to stay home. He has tried repeatedly to file an unemployment claim, but hasn't managed to get through. ""So right now I am three weeks without income and I've got my rent coming up, I've got food I've got to buy,"" Mr. Copperfield said. ""Definitely I won't be paying bills this month."" Mr. Copperfield, 45, has been laid off in the past, including during the 2008-9 housing crisis, in which he ended up losing his home to foreclosure. But even then, he said, he was able to go out and find work as a handyman or even sell fish he caught. ""At least then I could go out and hustle work, even if it wasn't in my field,"" he said. ""Nobody can work right now, we're on like lockdown. And even if I could find side work, I'd be putting my family at risk."""

He was a creator of Area, the art-gallery-nightclub from the 1980s. He is also a conservationist with something of an obsession for turtles. And now he is the plaintiff in a federal lawsuit that accuses President Trump of violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, a once-obscure provision intended to prevent federal officials, including the president, from falling under the influence of foreign powers. Mr. Goode is an unlikely, reluctant and unusually prominent plaintiff in the high-stakes constitutional lawsuit. ""I do question the wisdom of it,"" he said over a cappuccino in the lobby of the Bowery Hotel, which looks like a British manor's library with a rain forest growing in it. ""Hopefully I am not going to get audited and harassed for the next three years, but it seemed like the right thing to do. I'm worried about veiled forms of retribution."" He was just back from a Rainforest Trust board meeting in Virginia and was headed to the West Coast outpost of his Turtle Conservancy in Ojai, Calif., where Galapagos tortoises and other creatures, some of which he has helped rescue from the black market, roam safely. His celebrity friends come there to roam, too. Their specific breeds, he doesn't want to mention.

Back to the Constitution. The foreign Emoluments Clause prohibits federal officials from accepting payment from foreign governments without the consent of Congress. It was written in the day when the founding fathers worried about kings trying to buy the favor of officials, and about such employees trying to make money off their positions. It hasn't been talked about much in the past 200 years. But because Mr. Trump maintains an ownership stake in the Trump Organization, with vast hotel, residential and commercial real estate holdings that foreign governments can direct business to, emoluments are once again a flash point.

The White House directed requests for comment about the suit to the Trump Organization, where a spokeswoman did not respond to emails. Sheri Dillon, a lawyer who represents the Trump Organization, has disputed that the Emoluments Clause applies to hotel rooms being rented by representatives of foreign governments, arguing that payments based on market rates for services do not represent an emolument. But in a news conference held just before Mr. Trump's inauguration, she said that the company would donate profits derived from foreign-governments to the Treasury.

Mr. Goode, whose hotels have catered to foreign dignitaries, isn't buying that argument. ""You can't say you are going to donate the money from foreign dignitaries because it's their collective entourages. How can you even quantify that?"" he said. ""The notion that the presidency doesn't benefit your business is really absurd."" Of particular interest is the Trump International Hotel in Washington. The Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States, for example, held a party there in February, according to NPR. And Politico has reported that a lobbying firm working for Saudi Arabia paid for a room at the hotel after Inauguration Day. Last month, a Washington artist named Robin Bell managed to project the words ""Pay Trump Bribes Here"" onto the hotel's facade. Mr. Goode had no hand in this, he said, but it tickled him. ""I love it,"" he said. ""Reminds me a little of what Louie Psihoyos does."" The emoluments lawsuit was originally filed on Jan. 23 by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal government watchdog group whose board includes constitutional scholars and former White House ethics lawyers. Some have argued, however, that the organization, known as CREW, lacked standing to file the case, saying that it is not sufficiently injured.

CREW disputes that it lacks standing. But it went looking for additional plaintiffs, which was not an easy sell. ""We spoke to a number of hotel owners. Eric was the only appropriate hotel owner willing to join the suit,"" said Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for CREW. Suing the president ""is a difficult decision for any person to make,"" said Noah Bookbinder, the group's executive director. In April, the suit was updated to add as plaintiffs Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a union that represents restaurant workers and owners, as well as Jill Phaneuf, an event-booker for the Glover Park Hotel, which is near embassies in Washington. Then it landed Mr. Goode. ""We really respect someone who is willing to stand on principle and take that plunge,"" Mr. Bookbinder said. Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional scholar who is among the lawyers representing CREW, said the addition of Mr. Goode helped buttress the suit's legitimacy. ""It makes it inconceivable that this lawsuit would be tossed out,"" he said, offering a bit wishful thinking, as the Justice Department, which is representing Mr. Trump, will almost certainly try to move at some point to have the case dismissed. Then Mr. Tribe's legal theory will really be tested. The lawsuit argues that Mr. Goode cannot compete in attracting hotel guests and diners representing foreign governments who believe they may gain favor with Mr. Trump by staying at his establishments. ""As a hotel and restaurant owner, Mr. Goode will be harmed due to a loss of revenue by defendant's ongoing financial interest in businesses which receive payments from foreign states, the United States, or state or local government."""

26342,"Twitter Will Ban All Political Ads, C.E.O. Jack Dorsey Says","The social media company's action is a stark contrast to that of Facebook, which is taking a hands-off approach to political advertising.",The action by Twitter is a stark contrast to how Facebook handles political advertising.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/business/30twitter/merlin_159753426_6bb65afc-cda3-4ef2-a2a8-575c45f1e342-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=c8080d10b995af298d49e9ab8bec779f9c3f50dde0671f7b731ca486e086a588&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/twitter-political-ads-ban.html,dc538099-1a13-5c41-abad-d23d9dc9ce12.jpg,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Twitter said on Wednesday that it would ban all political ads, putting a spotlight on the power and veracity of online advertising and ramping up pressure on Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to reverse his hands-off stance. Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, said political ads, including manipulated videos and the viral spread of misleading information, presented challenges to civic discourse, ""all at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale."" He said he worried the ads had ""significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle."" He added that he believed that the reach of political messages ""should be earned, not bought.""

Facebook has been attacked for that stance by Democrats, including the campaign of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Over the last two weeks, hundreds of Facebook's own employees also signed a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to reconsider how the company treated political ads. But Twitter's announcement that it would eliminate political ads, starting Nov. 22, prompted immediate attacks from the right. Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager for the 2020 election, said that Twitter's decision was a partisan act intended to silence conservatives. Mr. Parscale said in a statement that the move was ""a very dumb decision"" for Twitter's shareholders and he wondered if Twitter would also stop running ads ""from biased liberal media outlets"" that attacked Republicans. Democrats disagreed. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York praised Twitter and said ""if a company cannot or does not wish to run basic fact-checking on paid political advertising, then they should not run paid political ads at all."" Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, who is running for president, tweeted, ""Good. Your turn, Facebook.""

""I get that some people will disagree with our decisions,"" he said. ""But I don't think anyone can say we're not doing what we believe, or that we haven't thought hard about these issues."" Mr. Dorsey, 42, also did not mention Mr. Zuckerberg by name on Wednesday when he announced Twitter's new stance on political ads. But he pointedly and consistently took an opposite position to the Facebook chief executive, drawing a distinction between free speech and paid speech. In one veiled dig, Mr. Dorsey said the fight against online disinformation would be hampered if technology companies accepted payment for misleading political content. He said in the tweet that it was not credible for tech companies to say they were working hard against misinformation ""buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad...well...they can say whatever they want!"" Twitter had long allowed political ads, though it began taking steps recently to curtail them. After the 2016 American presidential election, Twitter started requiring advertisers to verify their identities and it published a database of political ads that ran on its service. More recently, it banned ads from state-backed media outlets after it traced misinformation about the protests in the semiautonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong to state-backed media outlets in China. Twitter said the ban would not greatly affect its advertising business, which is the main way that the company makes money. Ned Segal, Twitter's chief financial officer, said political ad spending for the 2018 midterm elections was less than $3 million. The company's annual revenue totals about $3 billion. The ban on political ads does not eliminate the toxicity that Twitter faces with political speech on its platform. The service, where politicians like Mr. Trump freely post messages, has said it will be lenient with world leaders who appear to violate its policies against violent speech on the site because it believes that preserving those tweets serve the public interest.

Twitter will face other challenges as it tries to determine what ads count as political. In addition to ads sponsored by political campaigns, Twitter also intends to ban ads that discuss political issues such as climate change. Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's head of legal, policy, trust and safety said in a tweet that Twitter defined political ads as those that ""advocate for or against legislative issues of national importance,"" including immigration and health care. Google, which did not immediately have a comment, has largely avoided the scrutiny over political ads, even though it -- like Facebook -- continued to run a controversial advertisement from the Trump campaign that made false claims about Mr. Biden. Google requires that someone who wants to buy a political ad must verify their eligibility to do so in the United States. Once the ads are ready to run, a Google team reviews the ad for policy violations, including misrepresentation or dishonest claims. An ad may be reviewed again if users flag it as problematic. Of the most recent 100 ads purchased on Google since July by the Trump campaign, seven were taken down for violating policy. Google declined to specify what policies were violated. Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said Twitter's prohibition of political ads reflected a return to the early goals of social media platforms. ""Social media platforms were seen as a great equalizer in terms of how humans consume information and how they connect with each other,"" he said. ""The concept of paid engagement or unequal engagement doesn't realize that vision."""
39341,Couture in the Shadow of the Women's March,What does female empowerment look like in a discipline defined by fantasy and tradition?,"Dior, couture spring 2017.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/27/fashion/27COUTURE-web-dior/27COUTURE-web-dior-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=83181dcf2582a36f2f3cebc8430eca0bcf851a386b891373c7d695f8f452d8dd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/fashion/couture-chanel-dior-maison-margiela-valentino.html,85ce1686-57fa-5d51-b395-5cd40e1b5446.jpg,"PARIS -- At the end of the Jean Paul Gaultier couture show -- after a stream of etched tuxedo suits, 1980s Crayola leathers and mega-shoulder furs with hibiscus prints; after the models had finally left the runway and the audience started packing up -- a man with a guitar slung around his neck appeared and perched on a stool by the side of the stage. Oops. Guess it wasn't over after all. Then up the curtain went again, to reveal ... a barefoot girl standing on a swing in an angelic silken nightie with a long blond braid trailing down her back and lacy sleeves like wings. She swayed to and fro for awhile to the strumming, then hopped off the swing and twirled down the catwalk before being swept off her feet by a shirtless stud in denim overalls, deposited in a wheelbarrow and carted off with great fanfare, into the sunset. Or at least backstage.

That was mostly a rhetorical question. There's a reason that Isabelle Huppert, just off her best actress Oscar nomination for playing a woman in ""Elle"" who, instead of falling to pieces after an attack, takes her vengeance into her own hands, attended the Armani Prive show not in the usual elaborate cocktail gown that celebrities favor for the front row, but rather a turquoise trouser suit and black mock turtleneck, and looked the cooler for it. When her fellow front-row celeb, Nicole Kidman, in a classic little black dress with statement jewels, knelt down to pay homage, you thought, ""I know what you mean."" It was, on the other hand, more difficult to figure out what Mr. Armani meant with the tangerine dream on the runway, from orange croc jackets to orange sequined slithers to long jeweled orange vests (there was some black, too). The issue of how relevant a historic discipline that is defined by making handmade clothes to order for the very few can be in a world roiled by social and political disruption was unavoidable this week -- in part because the couture shows began just after the Women's March on Washington, not to mention its sister marches all over the world, including Paris, and ended just before the March for Life. It seemed, at least to start, an unfortunate juxtaposition. It was hard not to think we were in the middle of a Marie Antoinette moment in the making.

Especially when Giambattista Valli situated his show of high/low ball gowns, minidresses cut to the thigh in front and streaming trains of mousseline and silk faille behind, in the Archives Nationales. The historic venue, that is to say, where the young queen's papers are kept (including the final letter she wrote before her beheading). The idea did not go over well with a French national trade union, which handed out leaflets in protest of the desecration-by-frivolity. Still, after it was all over, after we had finished the trek from one cultural monument to the other -- from the Musee Rodin, Invalides, the Centre Pompidou, the Palais de Chaillot, the Cirque D'Hiver (in case, you know, anyone was in any doubt about whether the French consider this particular discipline part of their patrimony) -- it was clear that behind the tulle and chiffon, the crystals and crepe, efforts were being made to bridge the gap between escapism and the contemporary. Couture is often treated as synonymous with the most extreme form of self-indulgence, in part because of designers' own tendency to self-indulge with the decoration (more sequins! more encrustation!) and the show decor. But at its essence it is, or is when it succeeds, about empowering the individual.

Elsewhere, the difference was in the details. At Christian Dior, the first woman to run the house, Maria Grazia Chiuri, performed a deceptive sleight of hand. In a tent in the gardens of the Musee Rodin, she constructed a verdant moss-covered maze around a magical tree dripping jewels and trinkets that recalled nothing so much as ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" She populated it with Little Black Riding Hood tailleurs and an array of evermore romantic evening dresses clasped at the waist by sculptural belts and crowned at the head. Yet, fancy though they were, the clothes had a shrugged-on insouciance. Oh, this old ball gown? Paired with barely there kitten heels that kicked up the moss as the models strode along, they looked as comfortable as a sweatshirt. Ms. Chiuri said she had been fascinated by the concept of transformation (hence the masked ball theme, and the set), but the real transformation was in taking a formal garment and giving it a palpable ease, so the woman inside could just, well -- get on with it.

Likewise, at Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli accessorized his Grecian columns and palazzo pants and Aphrodite dresses with flat leather-strap sandals, the kind found at many an Italian resort, and loosed -- or lost -- the structure from his clothes. Instead of being armored, or preserved in amber, femininity was being unbound, shrouded in crepe pleats and veils of tulle. The idea that flat shoes could represent progress may seem absurd. But this is a world where words like ""fairy and ""princess"" are used so often they have become cliches. In that context, a sandal and absolute simplicity can be a radical move. So was swapping out the paillettes and bugle beads, the way Riccardo Tisci did at Givenchy, and instead using small circular fabric ""mirrors"" as adornment on cold-shoulder prairie-queen silk gowns. The most complicated dress in the collection, one that took 2,000 hours to make, was made solely of linked dream catchers, each woven from black thread by hand in a different pattern.

And though Karl Lagerfeld constructed a mirrored Art Deco salon complete with cream suede sofas and calla lilies for Chanel, transposing rooms at 31 Rue Cambon to the echoing environs of the Grand Palais, what was most notable was not the surround, but rather the way the silhouette had been altered by adding a plain leather belt, cinched just at the lower ribs, to everything from boucle suiting to crystalline slips finished in a flounce of feathers. It could have been a discordant note amid the sparkling sophistication but instead it created an impression of streamlined modernity, and kept nostalgia at bay. It's worth noting that, while Chanel (like Gaultier) is one of the few houses left that still closes its show with a bride -- Elie Saab and Ralph & Russo also cling on, but most have jettisoned that anachronism -- this time around she had lost her veil and simply strode the runway in a long pink dress. There was a cascade of ruffles at the sleeves and skirt, but look closer and the latter was cut just high enough in the front to allow freedom of movement. Or, put another way: progress."
25291,"Kanye West Teases 'Jesus Is King,' a New Album With No Cursing","At his third listening party in three days, the rapper showed off a fresh side of himself with a gospel-tinged record that has yet to be released.",Fans lined up outside the United Palace Theater in Upper Manhattan on Sunday night.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/30/arts/30kanye-2/30kanye-2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4aa4c4ec092a81ccafe5cd32f802c33fa37f5b79a30a9d0a8a61973dba408e94&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/arts/music/kanye-west-jesus-is-king.html,98d606ff-5dc9-5eb0-ba7d-1c18816ec458.jpg,"Invited guests and fans who scored free tickets heard Kanye West's unfinished new album, ""Jesus Is King,"" at listening events over the weekend.





On Sunday night in Upper Manhattan, in a display of controlled chaos that has by now become routine, Kanye West once again ignored a promised album release date, opting instead to play the work-in-progress for a hastily assembled congregation of true believers. ""Jesus Is King,"" the rapper's gospel-influenced ninth album, was originally slated for release on Friday, Sept. 27, according to social media and his official website; after the day came and went, his wife, Kim Kardashian West, said via a post on Instagram stories that the LP would arrive on Sunday. By Monday morning , no new music was commercially available. Instead, West opted to spend the weekend hosting impromptu listening parties for the unfinished album in three cities -- Detroit on Friday, Chicago on Saturday, New York on Sunday -- sticking with the seat-of-his-pants rollout strategy that he employed for his previous two albums, ""The Life of Pablo"" in 2016 and ""Ye"" last year.

But while West's events for previous releases were live-streamed online for the broader public -- from Madison Square Garden and an idyllic Wyoming ranch -- his celebrations for ""Jesus Is King"" were more decidedly intimate. He invited V.I.P.s (Chris Rock, Alexander Wang) and fans who snagged free tickets released a few hours before to landmark theaters for a playback with brief commentary. Each gathering had its own line of ""Jesus Is King"" merchandise for sale.

In fact, the album's lyrics contained no curse words from either West or his collaborators (Ty Dolla Sign, Pusha T, No Malice) and instead focused almost exclusively on religious salvation. Across 10 tracks, with titles like ""On God,"" ""Water"" and ""Use This Gospel,"" West repeatedly invoked Jesus Christ, declaring on the opening track, ""Beauty From Ashes,"" ""Your light has healed me"" and ""I could tell you/He could show you."" ""Can I bring the gospel to New York right quick?"" West asked the responsive crowd, which included members of his roving choir, whose exaltations blended with and encouraged those of his fans. (Earlier in the day, West had brought his pop-up Sunday Service to the Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, in Queens.) In song, West also alluded to his public struggles in recent years with lines like ""I came to you empty/free of my pride"" and ""Told the devil that I'm going on a strike/I've been working for him my whole life."" On the track ""Selah,"" he referenced ""Yandhi,"" the album he had planned to release last November, and seemed to point to religion as the reason it was shelved: ""Everybody wanted 'Yandhi,'"" he rapped, ""and Jesus did the laundry."" Even the song ""New Body,"" a demo of which had leaked online, had been altered for content, turning its more secular, sexual lyrics to something more chaste and respectful.

West, who has been criticized for his unpredictable pronouncements on subjects like slavery and mental health and his support of President Donald J. Trump, faced the harshest reviews and lowest sales of his career in the wake of ""Ye"" last year. But instead of confronting his detractors head-on, as he has been prone to do, he opted largely for messages of hope and positivity in his new music. ""No more living for the culture,"" he declares on ""Jesus Is King."" ""We nobody's slave."""
48988,"In Dubai's Al Quoz, the Gritty Opposite of Glamorous","This unpolished area of nondescript warehouses unexpectedly houses some of Dubai's best creative enterprises, from galleries and shops to start-ups.","A cafe in the Al Quoz Industrial Area, now a center for artists and their followers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/22/travel/22HEADS1/22HEADS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=ef82f6903c15607800fea694a41134314b310b81c68510c17173dc1718524391&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/travel/dubai-tourism-al-quoz.html,af3940dd-59c6-5d11-8fb0-4928942ebaf6.jpg,"It's impossible not to recognize the moment you pass into Dubai's Al Quoz Industrial Area. Instead of the immense spires of gunmetal gray and glass that populate neighborhoods on either side, the buildings are two- or three-story warehouses in a Creamsicle orange that matches the sand that spills onto the road. It's an abrupt transition; the area is the unpolished opposite to the glamorous, glossy image that springs to mind when thinking of this part of the United Arab Emirates. In addition to its topography, Al Quoz is unique among neighborhoods of Dubai in that it has developed an identity, rather than having been assigned one. Dubai's neighborhoods have names like Media City, Knowledge Village and the International Financial Center: functional, polished campuses that attract denizens of their namesake industries with special economic regulations, jurisdictions and foreign ownership allowances.

Alserkal Avenue (alserkalavenue.ae), a gated compound of warehouses veneered in gray corrugated metal, was an early addition to the neighborhood in 2007, and now plays host to many of the creative initiatives that come to Al Quoz. The center's galleries and cafes are a natural habitat for international fashion types, bored-looking beauties sporting man buns and diaphanous separates. It's the brainchild of Abdelmonem Alserkal, 47, a good-natured, gray-haired real estate heir who created the arts hub from a disused marble processing factory owned by his family. Mr. Alserkal, elegant in his traditional white robes, met me in a space that was clearly once sleek but is now overflowing with clutter (including his extensive collection of Tintin figurines). His team has recently moved to new offices as the complex completes an expansion that will double its size. For the 50 new spaces, ""we had more than 400 applications,"" including galleries, shops and start-ups, he said.

Alserkal Avenue's expansion mirrors the rising international profile of the artists who call Al Quoz home. Last year, the Iranian sculptor Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian, represented by the Third Line gallery (thethirdline.com), headquartered at Alserkal, had a solo exhibition at the Guggenheim in New York. Artists and galleries began to decamp to the area in the mid-2000s. The cheap rents helped, of course, but so has the versatility of the structures.

""Art spaces need to build walls, break them down, change things all the time to suit their programming,"" said Ms. Pawani of thejamjar, which established itself in Al Quoz in 2007 (and moved to Alserkal Avenue earlier this year). ""If a gallery wants to set up in one of Dubai's prime areas, they will have to rent a shop space, which limits this kind of flexibility.""

A symbiosis emerged between the new tenants and old. The area's manufacturing and construction industries were convenient for both the raw material and skilled tradesmanship necessary to make art at scale. ""You also have neighbors where you can buy light fittings, glass and who can do carpentry, whatever you need,"" she said. Warehouses aren't the artists' only neighbors. As the city boomed in the 1990s, property developers bought up the inexpensive desert tracts in Al Quoz, inland from the Persian Gulf coast, to erect living quarters for their workers, most of them migrants from South Asia. These two-story barracks are rectangles of cinder block and concrete, built around a central courtyard and enclosed by high fences topped with barbed wire. Al Quoz is one of the only points in Dubai where the elite fashion set and these low-paid migrant workers cross paths. The chasm between these groups remains vast, but tentative connections are being established. Last year, the Palestinian artist Hazem Harb exhibited a video and sculpture installation focusing on the laborers building Alserkal Avenue's expansion; thejamjar has hosted a singing competition for construction workers as part of an ""American Idol""-style initiative, Champ of the Camp. For now, the man with perhaps the most insight into the changing neighborhood, and surely its most popular, is the Chai Guy, a Pakistani entrepreneur who cycles from labor camps to galleries with a samovar of spiced milky tea. At every stop he is met by throngs looking to trade 1 dirham (about 25 cents) for a sugary fix -- and a chat, if you happen to speak Punjabi."
41844,Facebook Scrambles to Police Content Amid Rapid Growth,"Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, said he would hire 3,000 more people to monitor posts and live video as the site nears 2 billion users.","The funeral in Thailand last month for an 11-month-old killed by her father, who broadcast her death on Facebook Live.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/04/business/04FACEBOOK/04FACEBOOK-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=342d0de96b7e696bb4b1a952841f0546fbef7d7390e5b58464e43c43778625ea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/technology/facebook-moderators-q1-earnings.html,826680c6-1e93-5993-a6ca-e130f5c45877.jpg,"SAN FRANCISCO -- As a business, Facebook is more successful than ever. On Wednesday afternoon, it reported another quarter of huge growth, with nearly 2 billion people actively using the service and revenue up 49 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago. But with the company's vast reach has come another kind of problem: Facebook is becoming too big for its computer algorithms and relatively small team of employees and contractors to manage the trillions of posts on its social network. Earlier Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, acknowledged the problem. In a Facebook post, he said that over the next year, the company would add 3,000 people to the team that polices the site for inappropriate or offensive content, especially in the live videos the company is encouraging users to broadcast. ""If we're going to build a safe community, we need to respond quickly,"" he wrote. ""We're working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner -- whether that's responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down."" He offered no details on what would change.

Most of the company's reviewers are low-paid contractors overseas who spend on average of just a few seconds on each post. A National Public Radio investigation last year found that they inconsistently apply Facebook's standards, echoing previous research by other outlets. Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at University of North Carolina who studies online speech issues, said that Facebook designed Live to notify your friends automatically about a live feed -- something guaranteed to appeal to publicity seekers of all sorts. ""It was pretty clear to me that this would lead to on-camera suicides, murder, abuse, torture,"" she said. ""The F.B.I. did a pretty extensive study of school shooters: The infamy part is a pretty heavy motivator."" Facebook has no intention of dialing back its promotion of video, including Live, telling investors on a conference call Wednesday that it would continue to rank it high in users' news feeds and add more advertising within live videos and clips. Advertising is Facebook's lifeblood, accounting for most of the company's revenue and profit. In the first quarter, the company earned $3.1 billion, up 76 percent from the previous year. Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with the research firm eMarketer, said that all the negative publicity about Facebook's problems with horrific content and fake news appears to have hurt user satisfaction levels. Adding more content monitors is aimed at reassuring Facebook's 1.94 billion users, she said. ""If people feel safe on Facebook, they will be more engaged and will use it more often,"" Ms. Williamson said. ""And if they use it more often, there will be more inventory for advertising.""

Although there is little question that live-streamed murder does not belong on the service, the company has come under fire when it has stopped violent broadcasts like Korryn Gaines's fatal standoff with police in Maryland last year. ""All policies need to recognize that distressing speech is sometimes the most important to a public conversation,"" said Lee Rowland, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who works on free speech issues. She said that the decision to hire more moderators can only help the company make better judgments, especially about live events where fast decisions can be critical. ""Humans tend to have more nuance and context than an algorithm,"" Ms. Rowland said. But Ms. Rowland said Facebook must also be more clear to the public about its rules on making those calls. Mr. Zuckerberg called the recent episodes of violence ""heartbreaking"" and said the company wanted to make it simpler and faster for reviewers to spot problems and call in law enforcement when needed."
4760,NASA's 'Worm' Logo Will Return to Space,"The new old logo, dropped in the 1990s in favor of a more vintage brand, will adorn a SpaceX rocket that is to carry astronauts to the space station in May.","The &ldquo;worm&rdquo; logo was designed by Bruce Blackburn. He and his design firm partner, Richard Danne, overhauled the visual appearance for NASA in 1975.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/science/06NASA1/06NASA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=00d151791796dcb386728b0bedd3cd0e2b9061766ce423a73a416fd68cc194b0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/nasa-logo-worm-spacex.html,07cad5c2-bdd0-5466-921b-3ab20d82a436.jpg,"The ""worm"" logo was designed by Bruce Blackburn. He and his design firm partner, Richard Danne, overhauled the visual appearance for NASA in 1975.





It was designed for NASA in the 1970s, and it hasn't been back to space since the 1990s. But in 2020, it will head to orbit once more. It's a logo that a generation grew up with -- a minimalist twisting of red letters that is nicknamed after terrestrial invertebrates. NASA used it from 1975, when it was introduced as part of a cleaner visual redesign for the space agency, to 1992, when it was kicked to the side. But the familiar yet long unused modern symbol will be seen on the side of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket when two NASA astronauts, Douglas G. Hurley and Robert L. Behnken, head to the International Space Station, a mission scheduled for the second half of May. They will be the first to launch to orbit from American soil since 2011, and the new old logo was dusted off to commemorate the milestone. In 1992, Daniel S. Goldin, then NASA's administrator, decided that the best way to excite people about the future was to harken to the agency's heady early days. He resurrected an earlier insignia with a different nickname -- ""the meatball.""

The meatball -- a blue circle filled with stars, a red swoosh that represents an airplane wing and a spacecraft orbiting the wing -- was NASA's logo during the agency's greatest accomplishments, including the Apollo moon landings, and NASA has used it for the last 28 years. The ""meatball"" logo being painted on the wing of the space shuttle Endeavor in 1998. The worm, however, was not forgotten, especially among members of Generation X such as Jim Bridenstine, the current NASA administrator. Mr. Bridenstine often points out that he is the first administrator to be born after the end of the Apollo program. ""I grew up in the '80s,"" Mr. Bridenstine said in an interview. ""In the '80s, the worm logo was the logo of NASA. I've always been kind of partial to it."" Five years ago, two graphic designers, Jesse Reed and Hamish Smyth, republished an official 1976 document, the ""National Aeronautics and Space Administration Graphics Standards Manual,"" which prescribed how the new logo should be used. The reissue is now in its fifth printing, with more than 30,000 copies sold.

""We had said among ourselves, 'How cool would it be if it actually came back one day?'"" Mr. Smyth said. ""It was kind of the fantasy. We never seriously thought it would happen."" Since 2017, use of the worm logo has been permitted on T-shirts and other souvenirs sold all over the world. ""We've just seen it come to rise in popular culture, in fashion in particular,"" Mr. Reed said. Since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011, American astronauts have relied on Russia and its Soyuz rockets for transportation to orbit. But as SpaceX was getting close to the first launch of its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule with astronauts aboard, Mr. Bridenstine thought, ""It would be a fitting tribute to that moment to bring back the worm as an inspiration to the nation."" The announcement of the worm revival was initially scheduled to go out April 1 when it might have been mistaken as an April Fool's joke. It was pushed back a day.

""What they were trying to represent in the '70s was cutting-edge technology,"" Mr. Smyth said. ""They got it so right that it still looks like cutting-edge technology even though it's close to 40 years later."" By coincidence, April 2 is the birthday of Richard Danne, the designer who directed the 1970s graphics reinvention.

""I was thrilled to see the announcement, especially since it arrived on my 86th birthday!"" Mr. Danne wrote via email. ""What a marvelous present here."" It was not a complete surprise. About a month ago, designers from SpaceX reached out to Mr. Reed and Mr. Smyth to find out the correct shade of red they should be using. The men put SpaceX in touch with Mr. Danne. ""Naturally I started putting two and two together,"" Mr. Danne said. In the manual, the color was defined as simply ""NASA Red."" Today, there is a universal color matching system defined by the Pantone company, and NASA Red is Pantone color number 179. For now, the worm will appear just on the one SpaceX rocket, and NASA is keeping the meatball as its primary icon. But Mr. Bridenstine said the worm could find a wider role at NASA. ""We're kind of working through it right now,"" he said. Mr. Bridenstine said he could imagine that a second spacecraft for taking NASA astronauts to the space station, the Starliner built by Boeing, might also sport the worm logo. ""We haven't gotten that far yet,"" he said. ""But I imagine when the Starliner launches, it would likely have the worm as well."" But the Starliner will not have its first crewed flight for a while. After a flawed test flight without astronauts in December, Boeing will repeat the uncrewed mission before launching astronauts, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The company later acknowledged the decision. Regardless of how NASA decides to mix and match two very different designs, fans of the worm are ecstatic that a beloved icon that had been tossed into the dust bins of graphic design indeed has a future."

10147,The Anonymous Professor Who Wasn't,A professor at Arizona State University does not exist.,BethAnn McLaughlin in late 2018.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/09/fashion/04McLaughlin/04McLaughlin-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5aeb702ec8b7f3b775f4215aaff2a44c8b2b82eb160c3de274728d8cbfb1aa56&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/style/college-coronavirus-hoax.html,22103f6b-153c-5784-a227-313dae9cd5c0.jpg,"An anonymous anthropology professor remained outspoken about fairness in academia even as she suffered for months with coronavirus. ""This person was a scientist who got Covid because they'd been forced to teach,"" said Michael Eisen, a fly geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley, who had interacted on Twitter with the professor for years. ""It wasn't the first person I knew who got Covid -- but for a lot of people it was one of the first people they knew who got it."" He said that he had continued to exchange messages with the person running the account through June and that this person frequently discussed a difficult recovery. Then BethAnn McLaughlin, another Twitter connection, announced on July 31 that the anonymous professor had died from complications of the virus.

Just a few days later, both the account of the anonymous professor and of Ms. McLaughlin were suspended for Twitter policies that, among other things, bar the coordination of fake accounts. The same day, Gerardo Gonzalez, a spokesman for Arizona State University, where the anonymous Twitter user was supposedly a professor, described the anonymous account as a ""hoax."" The account had posted inaccurate information about the school, he said. ""We also have had no one, such as a family member or friend, report a death to anyone at the university,"" he added. Among scientists and academics, the shock of mourning was already laced with suspicion. Enough of them had unpleasant interactions with the combative account and were troubled by its inconsistencies and seeming about-turns. ""You have these internal alarms that are like, 'Oh, I don't trust you,'"" said Julie Libarkin, the head of the Geocognition Research Laboratory at Michigan State University. ""Kind of the same as when I worked with BethAnn.""

On Tuesday, Ms. McLaughlin gave a statement to The New York Times through her lawyer. ""I take full responsibility for my involvement in creating the @sciencing_bi Twitter account,"" it said. ""My actions are inexcusable. I apologize without reservation to all the people I hurt."" The anonymous account, @Sciencing_Bi, was an active participant in the corner of Science Twitter that frequently discusses issues of sexual misconduct in the sciences. It claimed on at least one occasion to have grown up in Alabama, to have ""fled the south because of their oppression of queer folk,"" and to have attended Catholic school. The account began to pointedly make reference to being Native American and, earlier this year, began to identify as Hopi. Since 2016, it has posted often about issues around social justice in the sciences, with a focus on activism and research about sexual harassment. It was also active in the career of Ms. McLaughlin, a neuroscientist. (News of the relationship between the Twitter accounts was reported by Heavy.com, Science and the Chronicle of Higher Education.) It was key in promoting a petition that called for Ms. McLaughlin to be given tenure at Vanderbilt University. She was not given tenure in 2017, a decision she said was influenced by her having testified against a former Vanderbilt professor accused of sexual harassment. Her effort to reverse that decision was unsuccessful in 2019, and she left the university that summer. On one occasion, the account responded to someone asking Ms. McLaughlin for information about Vanderbilt with extensive details about the university's salary structure. In April, @Sciencing_Bi began to undergo a drama that belonged solely to her, announcing the coronavirus diagnosis in a tweet. It was Ms. McLaughlin who announced that the anonymous professor had died.

""I was pretty shocked,"" said Erica Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at Indiana University. ""I had never had particularly great experiences with @Sciencing_Bi, but I thought that she was a whole real human who had just died. I was surprised by how hard it hit me. I ate a pint of ice cream about it."" Ms. McLaughlin came across as particularly distraught. She mourned @Sciencing_Bi in a long thread, paying testament to her humanity and toughness. ""She was supposed to get Hopi talisman for health as gifts for us but she ran out,"" Ms. McLaughlin tweeted. ""God. The irony of running out of health talisman."" She also said that she and the person behind the account had been planning on getting matching tattoos in the Hopi language. Ms. McLaughlin has prompted particular frustration and disgust by posing as a Hopi woman, right as the coronavirus has caused disproportionate harm to Indigenous communities in the United States. ""There are millions who want to be us,"" said Jacqueline Keeler, a writer and the editor of Pollen Nation, a Native-led magazine. ""These people are centering themselves in our issues, they are heading Native American departments, they are telling Native students what they can and can't study -- it's to protect their own position. And so it does change our ability to advocate for ourselves when we are constantly being replaced by frauds, white people or other people of different backgrounds pretending to be us."" 'It Just Became Obvious to Me' The first time Mr. Eisen heard from the account was in defense of Ms. McLaughlin. ""The fact that @Sci-Bi was saying all these things about BethAnn, saying that BethAnn had helped her, it didn't make me trust BethAnn -- but it made me less willing to publicly criticize her because I thought that public criticism would be felt by the people she was helping,"" he said. ""Who turned out to be fake.""

Melissa Bates, a professor at the University of Iowa, was among those invited to a Zoom memorial via a Twitter thread. Ms. Bates said on Twitter that when she showed up on the Zoom, it was just her, Ms. McLaughlin, Mr. Eisen and another man. Afterward, Mr. Eisen began to search for any evidence that @Sciencing_Bi had been a real person. He could not find any. ""The combination of the weird things that were happening on the call and looking at the tweets and seeing how much they circled BethAnn, it just became obvious to me,"" he said. ""'Oh, this is BethAnn.'"" Ms. McLaughlin first began to make waves among those concerned about sexual harassment in the sciences in May 2018. She wrote and circulated a petition that month calling for the National Academy of Sciences to revoke the membership of those who had been punished for sexual harassment, retaliation and assault. In June 2018, she and Ms. Libarkin started a website, MeTooSTEM, which quickly garnered attention, as women posted a series of largely anonymous stories there about being harassed while working in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). In the same month, Ms. McLaughlin further raised her profile when she used Twitter to successfully pressure the website ratemyprofessor.com to drop its system of chili peppers used to rank the ""hotness"" of academics.

In October 2018, Ms. McLaughlin, who had begun to make decisions for the organization without informing her colleagues, created a fund-raiser for MeTooSTEM on GoFundMe. It eventually raised more than $79,000. Ms. McLaughlin's colleagues at MeTooSTEM were already feeling uncomfortable with her leadership at that point, and were made particularly uneasy by the GoFundMe. ""We were about to get in front of a crowd of people and say: 'Give us your money,'"" said Ms. Smith. She didn't know how the money would be used, but did remember thinking: ""We're too broke to participate in white-collar crime."" Former colleagues of Ms. McLaughlin at MeTooSTEM said they did not know where that money ultimately went. A 2019 report from MeTooSTEM said that the money, along with other donations, had ""provided free services for 18 months to over 500 clients."" In November 2018, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab awarded its Disobedience Award to Ms. McLaughlin; Tarana Burke, a founder of the #MeToo movement; and Sherry Marts, who left academia after being harassed by a colleague in her graduate lab. The award recognizes ""ethical, nonviolent acts of disobedience"" and comes with $250,000, which that year was split among the three recipients. As Ms. McLaughlin received more public recognition, her colleagues at MeTooSTEM began to leave the organization, accusing her of frequent verbal abuse and citing the dysfunction plaguing the organization. By May 2019, seven members had resigned, according to a report in BuzzFeed at the time.

Deanna Arsala recently received a doctorate from the University of Illinois at Chicago and was one of the few women of color at MeTooSTEM. She said that @Sciencing_Bi had claimed to know details about leadership meetings that included only BethAnn and a few other people. ""I remember thinking, 'Is this BethAnn?'"" Ms. Arsala said. Ms. Arsala left the organization in part because she and another colleague, also a woman of color, felt that white leadership did not prioritize what they had to say. Kathryn Clancy, an anthropology professor at the University of Illinois who was also involved in the MeTooSTEM movement and who is white, said that even as Ms. McLaughlin's leadership issues brought bad publicity, her issues with race had gone largely overlooked, even as women of color inside and outside the organization had tried to get others to see them. In February of 2020, another BuzzFeed report detailed further strife and resignations at MeTooSTEM. Activists including Ms. Marts publicly distanced themselves from the embattled MeTooSTEM leader; they even officially resigned from the hashtag.

And Ms. McLaughlin's invention of the character behind @Sciencing_Bi was not as unusual as it may seem -- nor would it have been unusual for her to have killed off the account. Dr. Marc Feldman is a psychiatrist who studies factitious disorders in which a person acts as if they, or a loved one, have a disease. He specializes in what he calls Munchausen by internet, in which such deceptions take place online, and said he hears about a new case every couple of weeks. ""I think it happens online more than offline these days because it's so easy to mislead people via social media,"" Dr. Feldman said. He added that Covid-19 had been a boon for those with such disorders. ""Nobody wants to be near a Covid-19 sufferer so they say, 'We can't meet,'"" he said. ""There's no way to arrange a face-to-face meeting."" In her statement, Ms. McLaughlin said: ""As I've reflected on my actions the last few days, it's become clear to me that I need mental health treatment, which I'm pursuing now. My failures are mine alone, so I'm stepping away from all activities with MeTooSTEM to ensure that it isn't unfairly criticized for my actions."" ""These Pretendians are better at it than we are, because they don't carry our specific trauma,"" Ms. Keeler said. And: ""They are ethnic opportunists and that is a colonial endeavor that has been going on for centuries in this hemisphere."" Even the lack of tenure of the pretend professor served a purpose, giving the account a perfectly good reason for remaining anonymous."

It has been a rough year. By now, our violence is down to a pattern, and there is a choreography to our reactions. A killer seeks out a nightclub, a church, an airport, a courthouse, a protest. Someone is shot on video, sometimes by the police, and marchers fill the streets. An attack is carried out in France, America, Turkey, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Tunisia, Nigeria, and then claimed and celebrated by a radical terror group. Our phones vibrate with news alerts. The talking heads fill air over cable news captions that shout ""breaking news"" in red. Rumors and misinformation abound. The comments erupt on Twitter, Facebook and news sites.

So, what is this doing to us? It depends on the individual, but living in a digitally linked world where broadcasts of violence are instantaneous and almost commonplace means that many of us are becoming desensitized, Anita Gadhia-Smith, a psychologist in Washington, said Friday. ""With the frequency of shootings and terror attacks there is a sense of anxiety that's building in people,"" she said, ""a sense of vulnerability and powerlessness."" The invasive symptoms of PTSD can affect combat veterans and civilians alike. Early intervention is critical for managing the condition.

The constant stream of news on social media can also be traumatic. A team of researchers at the University of Bradford in England told a British psychology conference last year that exposure to violent imagery on social media can cause symptoms that are similar to post-traumatic stress disorder, defined as a persistent emotional reaction to a traumatic event that severely impairs one's life.

In an analysis conducted by the Bradford researchers, 189 participants were shown images and provided with stories of violent events, including the Sept. 11 attacks, school shootings and suicide bombings. The researchers' analysis showed that 22 percent of those who participated were significantly affected by what they saw. The study also found that people who view violent events more often were more affected than people who saw them less frequently, and that people who described themselves as extroverts with outgoing personalities were at a higher risk to be disturbed by the images. The self-care advice hasn't changed. It is natural to want to follow along with incremental updates on social media and in the news. But it's important to know that this can heighten your anxiety. Anne Marie Albano, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Columbia University Clinic for Anxiety and Related Disorders, said in an interview after the 2015 Paris attacks that it might be a good idea to limit your exposure to social media. Designating times to plug into the news -- checking Twitter in the morning over coffee, but not listening to the radio while driving your kids to school, for instance -- can help you manage anxiety if you are feeling stressed. ""This will help you balance a realistic and credible threat with information that is sensationalized,"" Dr. Albano said, ""or a rush to report something or talk about something that doesn't have the impact that you would think it has.""

If you're feeling anxiety about a possible attack, compare your fear with the facts. When you fear the worst, it's hard to remember that, say, a flight or a train ride has extraordinarily high odds of being safe. But you have to try. Humans are bad at assessing risk, Martin Seif, a psychologist who specializes in treating anxiety disorders and the fear of flying, said in an interview late last year. ""Every single anxiety-management technique is based on the premise that your reaction is out of proportion"" to the likelihood of danger, Dr. Seif said. Also, remember to take a breath. A guide to dealing with terrorism released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation encourages closing your eyes and taking deep breaths to feel calmer. Taking a walk or talking to a close friend can also help. The guide also recommends avoiding alcohol and drugs, exercising regularly and eating healthy foods -- basic self-care guidelines that help reduce stress. Make sure you have a plan to contact your family if something happens, especially if cellular networks are overloaded or transportation is disrupted, but remember that you most likely will not need it, experts say. If you have children, the American Psychological Association recommends asking them how they are feeling about the news. Keep in mind that it is possible for children to be influenced by news reports and the adult conversations around them."
14098,YouTube Cut Down Misinformation. Then It Boosted Fox News.,"To battle false information, YouTube cut its recommendations to fringe channels and instead promoted major networks, especially Fox News.",YouTube has recommended a clip of Tucker Carlson more than almost any other news-related video in recent weeks,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/04/business/03foxtube/03foxtube-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4b6db68ae8beb6c8c4c4a67acb495d5ce7c3a2de67e63555ffa29772981d27a2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/technology/youtube-misinformation-fox-news.html,1eac1a8b-9073-5c1f-832c-065cba989ad3.jpg,"After the 2016 election, engineers at YouTube went to work on changes to a YouTube algorithm that had become one of the world's most influential lines of computer code. That algorithm decided which videos YouTube recommended that users watch next; the company said it was responsible for 70 percent of the one billion hours a day people spent on YouTube. But it had become clear that those recommendations tended to steer viewers toward videos that were hyperpartisan, divisive, misleading or downright false. New data now shows that the effort, which was completed last year, mostly worked. In the weeks leading up to Tuesday's election, YouTube recommended far fewer fringe channels alongside news videos than it did in 2016, which helped it to reduce its spread of disinformation, according to research by Guillaume Chaslot, a former Google engineer who helped build YouTube's recommendation engine and now studies it. YouTube's efforts also had a knock-on effect: the amplification of Fox News. ""The channel most recommended in our data set in 2016 was Alex Jones,"" the notorious internet conspiracy theorist, who has since been barred from YouTube, Mr. Chaslot said. ""Now it's Fox News.""

YouTube's promotion of Fox News's unabashedly conservative pundits also undercut arguments from some of those same pundits that the biggest tech companies are trying to silence them. The Fox News star Tucker Carlson recently criticized comments by a Google executive that the company, which owns YouTube, would try to improve its search results to promote ""better quality of governance"" and decision making. ""What does that mean?"" Mr. Carlson said. ""In other words, they want to subvert democracy."" YouTube has recommended that clip of Mr. Carlson more than almost any other news-related video in recent weeks, according to Mr. Chaslot's data. The researchers and other analysts estimated that Fox News's growing popularity on YouTube and Facebook was largely due to its fitting into their algorithmic sweet spots. The network has been rubber-stamped as an authoritative source, which tells the algorithms to give it a boost, while its conservative talk shows' partisan headlines are effective at drawing clicks, which also tells the algorithms to keep promoting them. MSNBC and CNN were also among YouTube's most recommended channels on recent popular news videos, according to Mr. Chaslot's analysis, though less than Fox News. YouTube also frequently directed people toward their videos that had more partisan and sensational headlines. ""Clickbaitiness is still really important, as it was in 2016,"" Mr. Chaslot said. Farshad Shadloo, a YouTube spokesman, said in a statement that YouTube's algorithm changes contributed to a 141 percent increase in the time people spent watching videos from Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, NBC News, ABC News and CBS News collectively over the past year. ""Since 2018, we've been focused on ensuring when people come to YouTube looking for news and information, they get it from authoritative sources,"" he said.

A Fox News spokesperson said the network had worked hard to elevate its presence on YouTube. Fox News created a team focused on the platform and has made a point of posting videos that perform well with YouTube's search engine and with viewers, such as live broadcasts of breaking news. On Facebook, Fox News's page accounted for 10 percent of all interactions with posts about the election over the past week, according to CrowdTangle. That was second only to President Trump's official page, at 18 percent, and above Breitbart's at 6 percent. The next major network was CNN at 2 percent, roughly on a par with the page of ""Fox & Friends,"" the Fox News morning show. Facebook declined to comment but noted that interactions do not entirely reflect a post's reach, though they are the only measure of a post's popularity that the company makes available. In one analysis, Mr. Chaslot and Mr. Faddoul collected recommendations daily on videos posted by 800 of YouTube's most popular news-related channels over the three weeks that ended on Oct. 27. Fox News accounted for more than 3 percent of the 300,000 recommendations collected, more than twice the rate of the next-closest channel, the History Channel. CNN and MSNBC accounted for about 1 percent of recommendations. When the researchers analyzed only videos about the election from the same channels, Fox News accounted for 10 percent of all the recommendations, nearly three times the rate of the No. 2 most-promoted channel, MSNBC. Other analyses of recommendations alongside some of the most popular election-related videos also showed Fox News as the most-promoted channel. Given the enormous size and influence of social networks like YouTube and Facebook, changes to how they promote content often causes unforeseen outcomes, such as news organizations writing headlines or framing stories to please the new algorithms, said Arvind Narayanan, a computer scientist at Princeton University who studies the effect of algorithms on society. ""YouTube is constantly tinkering with its algorithms,"" he said. ""And when it does that, it always is going to have both intended and unintended effects."""

It's over. Go home. Go."" The final words of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986) loom over the empty streets of Minneapolis. A quote from ""Back to the Future"" (1985) reminds Vancouver, Wash., that leaving the house could cause serious repercussions. A marquee in Lake Oswego, Ore., encourages the community to stream a film that the theater never had a chance to show.

In mid-March, as Broadway went dark and ""nonessential"" businesses began to close their doors, the gravity and uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States grew. When movie theaters closed and owners buckled down for an indefinite hiatus, some chose to leave their own messages on the way out.

""It made me chuckle when I thought of it, and then it seemed to be making a lot of people chuckle,"" Mr. Perry said. ""But after about two weeks of that, as we sort of settled into the groove of coronavirus, it didn't quite speak to the outlook that I, at least, wanted Lake Oswego to walk away with.""

After watching Celine Sciamma's ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019), Mr. Perry decided to change his tactic. Read More on the Coronavirus Pandemic

Mr. Perry, who has worked at the Lake Theater & Cafe on and off for 23 years, said the two-screen theater is both a home for his staff and a home-away-from-home for his patrons. And though digital support is no substitute for the physical community that he's missing, it's still nice to see people laugh. ""The fact that it did catch on made me happy because it essentially showed there's a place for more hopeful messages; that dark humor isn't the only way we can express ourselves,"" Mr. Perry said, before laughing. ""It was also fun to see everybody think I was high, too.""

""Cinema was always -- for me -- about hope and optimism,"" Mr. Wyatt said. ""You always hope these marquee messages going out will resonate the same way, or create the same effect that people have while sitting together and watching a movie communally and sharing those emotions."" His single-screen theater has since caught the eye of many housebound movie fans, with Michael J. Fox -- who played Marty McFly in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy -- reposting a photo of the marquee himself. Since then, Mr. Wyatt has tried out two new messages: A play on different Tom Cruise movies and a reference to The Princess Bride. ""I think there's a communal experience that goes beyond the budget spectacle,"" Mr. Wyatt said. ""If you have a $100,000 movie theater in your home, it still does not compare to sitting elbow to elbow with people, and enjoying those experiences together,"" he continued. ""A comedy is going to be funnier, and an exciting adventure is going to be that much more exciting when it's watched communally.""

Though there's no end in sight yet, he's sure that the community will flock back to theaters once it's allowed. ""People really do enjoy going to the movies and getting out of their apartments and being with people in general -- that's why you live in New York, right?"" Mr. Viragh said. ""For all the culture, all the food, and all of the time spent with friends."" The other two sides of the Nitehawk's marquee say ""see you on the other side"" and advise passers-by to ""Be excellent to each other"" -- a message from ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" (1989) that has been written on theater marquees around the country. And perhaps when it's safe to reopen, theaters will add the response to that quote, rejoicing as we're finally able to ""Party on, dudes."""
41786,5 Must-See Shows if You're in New York This Month,"Offerings include a revival of Suzan-Lori Parks's ""Venus,"" at the Signature Theater, and Robert Schenkkan's ""Building the Wall,"" at New World Stages.","Zainab Jah, center, in ""Venus.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/01/theater/01fiveshows-venus/01fiveshows-venus-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a611af1c5b1d6ac40033bf754523f0202e3fab3d76b6ea906a94db9278161e6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/theater/5-must-see-shows-if-youre-in-new-york-this-month.html,51ab4187-6dba-53e7-856e-a73cb2e7a0b4.jpg,"Jesse Green, the new co-chief theater critic for The New York Times, was the theater critic and a feature writer for New York magazine. You can follow him on Twitter (@JesseKGreen) and Facebook (jesse.green.critic). Broadway is a bully in April, stealing attention, if not lunch money, from theater everywhere else in the city. But with the end of the bigfoot season on April 27 -- the date by which productions must have opened to compete for this June's Tony Awards -- it's once again safe for the smart, weird shows to come out and play. Aside from revivals of established masterworks, including the Sondheim-Weidman musical ""Pacific Overtures,"" at Classic Stage Company, and Beckett's ""Happy Days,"" at Theater for a New Audience, May looks to be hospitable to a wide range of proudly oddball productions, Off Broadway and beyond. Here are five that I'm especially looking forward to on my first day as the new co-chief theater critic here at The New York Times.

Suzan-Lori Parks is making the most of her role as a playwright in residence at the Signature Theater. A revival of her ""The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World"" was a highlight of the fall; since then, she's frequently been found making music in the Signature's convivial lobby with her band, Sula and the Noise.

Next up is a revival of this 1996 drama about Saartjie Baartman, an African woman ""of singular anatimy"" who was exhibited in 19th-century European freak shows as the ""Hottentot Venus."" (Zainab Jah, who played the warrior in ""Eclipsed,"" stars as Baartman; Lear deBessonet directs.) For Ms. Parks, drama is tangible, starting with the skin; no wonder she calls her Signature year a process of ""resurrecting my body of work.""

In 1954 it apparently seemed like a profitable notion to reset the story of Homer's ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey"" in Washington State, circa 1900, and turn it into a musical. The result was a three-month Broadway bomb. Still, over time, the delicious through-composed score by Jerome Moross and John Latouche, along with Mr. Latouche's clever book (Paris is a traveling salesman who runs off with Helen after an apple-pie-baking contest) turned the bomb into a cult. Who knows what this Encores! concert production, directed by Michael Berresse and starring Lindsay Mendez as Helen, and Ryan Silverman as Ulysses, may do for the show's reputation? In any case, the chance to hear the lush songs (including the standard ""Lazy Afternoon"") in their full orchestrations is probably, sadly, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Rachel Dolezal notwithstanding, most people don't get to choose their race -- or, therefore, what kind of racism they will experience or engender. That limitation on our power of perspective is temporarily corrected in this immersive production, conceived and written by James Scruggs, in which audience members, before entering a ""dystopian theme park"" called SupremacyLand, decide at the door what race they will be. (And no, you can't change your mind once you're in.) Incorporating large-scale video, text and music, the work (directed by Tamilla Woodard and Kareem Fahmy, at 3LD Art & Technology Center) may not be for the interactively squeamish, but perhaps that's part of the point.

A built-in paradox of theater is that for all its immediacy in the playhouse, it can take forever to get there. That's just one reason that this new drama by Robert Schenkkan (""The Kentucky Cycle,"" ""All The Way"") is an outlier and potentially a tonic. Written in one week and in a ""white-hot fury,"" as Mr. Schenkkan told The Times, it is a speculative fiction, set in 2019, in which a journalist (Tamara Tunie) interviews a Trump administration official (James Badge Dale) who is awaiting sentencing for his role in deporting immigrants after a terrorist attack. Whether the speed of composition will prove to have served the drama remains to be seen, but the speed with which it is reaching audiences is already impressive. Aside from this New York production, directed by Ari Edelson at New World Stages, five theaters have taken it up or are scheduled to present it in the coming months.

Can You Forgive Her? Gina Gionfriddo, a Pulitzer Prize finalist for both ""Becky Shaw"" and ""Rapture, Blister, Burn,"" has a scalding ear for satire. But there's also something classical about the way she sets up and complicates her premises; the apparently humble but actually rather conniving title character of ""Becky Shaw"" couldn't help invoking the similarly named Becky Sharp in Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair."" Likewise, her latest play, about a woman unable to choose what kind of life (and man) to make, may remind you of the 1864 Trollope novel with which it shares a title. Not a bad model. Amber Tamblyn, making her New York stage debut, stars, along with the Off Broadway familiars Darren Pettie, Frank Wood and Ella Dershowitz, under the direction of Peter DuBois at the Vineyard Theater."

Nominee, Paid Millions by Industry, Says He'll Recuse Himself if Needed",Scott Gottlieb made millions of dollars doing work for more than 20 health care companies in the private sector.,"Dr. Scott Gottlieb, President Trump's nominee to be commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/30/us/30GOTTLIEB/29GOTTLIEB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fa7745d0360540fb72a956fd5d5d21d2df79799f3530ae19199268fdbbeda3b3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/health/fda-nominee-scott-gottlieb-recuse-conflicts.html,7789dc5b-50a2-5f5d-83cf-7ffa5b2e534f.jpg,"President Trump has repeatedly slammed pharmaceutical companies for ""getting away with murder"" on soaring drug prices, but he and his nominee to head the Food and Drug Administration have pledged to ease industry regulations and speed approvals for medicines and other consumer products. The nominee, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, has spent the bulk of his career working in the drug and health care industry, which experts say raises the potential for myriad conflicts of interest. If confirmed to head the F.D.A., he would wield considerable power over companies and investment firms that have paid him millions of dollars over the years. From 2013 to 2015, for example, Dr. Gottlieb received more than $150,000 to advise Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a company whose two approved drugs are seen as breakthrough treatments for cystic fibrosis but carry list prices of more than $250,000 a year. He's the acting chief executive of Cell Biotherapy, an early-stage cancer biotech firm that he helped found. He has served for years as a consultant to pharmaceutical giants like GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol-Myers Squibb and is paid by other companies for his expertise. Dr. Gottlieb plans to recuse himself for one year from any agency decisions involving about 20 health care companies he worked with, according to an ethics agreement made public Wednesday. But that is unlikely to mollify critics who argue that someone with such close industry relationships should not be in charge of an agency whose mission is to protect consumers and uphold safety standards for products from lipstick to lifesaving cancer therapies.

""If you have a commissioner who is that conflicted, recusal is a tricky business,"" said Susan F. Wood, who resigned as the director of the F.D.A.'s Office of Women's Health in 2005 in protest over the agency's decision to delay over-the-counter approval of the morning-after pill. Dr. Gottlieb's nomination comes at a momentous time for the agency, which Mr. Trump has promised to significantly remake. The next commissioner will be charged with putting into practice a far-reaching law, passed in December, aimed at bringing drugs to market more quickly. Congress also must reauthorize a set of bills this year that determine how much the drug and medical device industry will pay in user fees, which fund more than half of the agency's budget to review new drugs. The president's other appointments for high-profile health roles, such as Dr. Tom Price, the health and human services secretary, and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have also come under fire for being too close to the businesses they regulate or for their investments in health care companies. Dr. Gottlieb's newly disclosed financial forms are likely to draw similar criticism at his Senate confirmation hearing on April 5. One line of inquiry could include a thorny issue that arose on Wednesday: The generic drugmaker Mylan announced that the F.D.A. had rejected its application to make a generic copy of the inhaler Advair Diskus, a best-selling product for GlaxoSmithKline. Dr. Gottlieb has called for making it easier to market generic versions of complex drugs like Advair to reduce prices, but he also received close to $90,000 in fees in 2016 and the first two months of this year as a Glaxo consultant, according to financial disclosures. Some say a yearlong recusal would not suffice. ""The question is going to be, are you going to have to recuse yourself from all the decisions that are going to have an impact on that company?"" said Dr. Wood, who is now an associate professor at George Washington University.

Leslie B. Kiernan, a lawyer for Dr. Gottlieb, said that his recusal plan was approved by federal ethics officials and that F.D.A. commissioners do not typically get involved in matters involving individual companies. ""Every individual who goes into government from the private sector with experience in the industry is going to have some recusals,"" she said. ""The key role of the commissioner is to set broad policies for the agency."" Others who know Dr. Gottlieb, including Democrats, praise his intellect and independent thinking, even as they acknowledge that he is likely to bring a more industry-friendly worldview to a sprawling agency of more than 16,000 employees. Dr. Gottlieb, 44, served as an F.D.A. deputy in the George W. Bush administration before leaving to do private consulting. With his medical training and government experience, he was considered the conventional choice over more radical candidates that Mr. Trump was said to be weighing. ""I think he is not so easily put into a box,"" said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, who was the agency's deputy commissioner in the Obama administration. Dr. Sharfstein said he had sought Dr. Gottlieb's advice when he took his job at the F.D.A., and the two have stayed in touch. ""I think he has the capability to really grow into the role."" In writings and speeches, Dr. Gottlieb has criticized the F.D.A., calling for more flexibility to permit access to drugs that provide strong clues -- but not conclusive evidence -- that they work. He has proposed ways to shake up the agency's bureaucratic structure, suggesting that drug approvals be made by more seasoned senior staff members, and that a special team oversee drugs intended for rare diseases. In a departure from the agency position that it has little control over drug costs, Dr. Gottlieb has also shown a willingness to take on high prices by making it easier for certain generic drugs to be approved. Some said Dr. Gottlieb's background is what qualifies him for the job. ""The alternative is to have a leader who may have no conflicts because they've never been involved in the drug development process,"" said Tim Coetzee, the chief advocacy, services and research officer at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which receives some funding from the drug industry and invests in drug development research. ""We don't think that is a sound approach.""

Those industry associations soon became a headache. In late 2005, he was forced to recuse himself from proposals on the avian flu, The Boston Globe reported, because he had consulted for major vaccine players, including Roche and Sanofi. Around the same time, emails leaked to Time magazine showed him questioning career F.D.A. employees over a decision to stop a multiple sclerosis drug trial, and expressing surprise at the rejection of an osteoporosis drug. Back then, Dr. Gottlieb defended his actions, saying he had to understand the agency's process. ""The agency was being highly politicized by the Bush administration, and he certainly was part and parcel of that politicization,"" Dr. Wood said. ""I think for that subset of F.D.A. career staff, the physicians who worked there, I think there was suspicion of everyone in leadership at the time."" While he was at the F.D.A., Dr. Gottlieb practiced medicine at a Connecticut hospital in his spare time, said John Taylor, a former F.D.A. lawyer who had worked with him. ""Scott would work two shifts at a hospital and see patients on the weekends,"" he said. ""I thought he was Superman."" In 2006, while he was a deputy commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb received a diagnosis of early-stage Hodgkins lymphoma, but he is now cancer free. In 2007, Dr. Gottlieb returned to the private sector, becoming a partner at New Enterprise Associates, where he advised the firm's health care team, and began consulting for a range of companies. Dr. Gottlieb also held seats on a number of corporate boards, including Tolero Pharmaceuticals, a Utah company working on cancer treatments, and MedAvante, which assists pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials. According to the federal ethics filings, Dr. Gottlieb said he would resign from all outside boards. The yearlong recusal, he said, would remove him from decisions on all the companies he received payments from, including six that he held a financial interest in while at New Enterprise Associates, all health care providers or lab testing companies that are overseen by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. He also listed several biotech start-ups that he invested in through T.R. Winston & Co., a merchant bank. Financial disclosure documents show Dr. Gottlieb made more than $3 million during 2016 and through March 1 of this year, including $1.85 million from T.R. Winston and $280,000 for consulting for New Enterprise, according to the disclosures, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. But the investments in T.R. Winston were not all in health care companies and included energy companies, as well as other firms.

Dr. Gottlieb, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, has also been a prolific writer and public speaker, criticizing the agency's approach. ""In so heavily prioritizing one of its obligations -- the protection of consumers -- the F.D.A. has sometimes subordinated and neglected its other key obligation, which is to guide new medical innovations to market,"" Dr. Gottlieb wrote in 2012 in National Affairs, a conservative-leaning political journal. Some of Dr. Gottlieb's views have alarmed researchers who argue that rigorous study of drugs and medical devices is the best way to ensure they work. In 2014, Dr. Gottlieb criticized a medical device study that used ""sham,"" or dummy, procedures as a kind of placebo. The sham procedure, he argued, was invasive and unnecessary, especially since the product, called renal denervation, was already approved in Europe to lower patients' blood pressure. But at the time Dr. Gottlieb wrote the article, Medtronic, the device's manufacturer, had already announced that the study had failed, and an article a month later in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that patients who underwent renal denervation did no better than those who received a fake procedure. ""Had we not done a sham control, the erroneous belief that this procedure worked would have persisted,"" said Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt, one of the study's principal investigators. He said Dr. Gottlieb's argument that the trial was unethical baffled him. ""I would think after seeing the results, any scientist or physician who understands clinical trials would come to the same conclusion, not the opposite conclusion."" These days, the F.D.A. has shown a willingness to approve products that have shown promise based on intermediate measures, like a shrinking tumor, rather than long-term outcomes like survival rates -- especially in cancer research. One recent study showed that the agency decides on drugs faster than its counterparts in Europe and Canada. In December, President Obama signed into law the 21st Century Cures Act, which further directs the F.D.A. to remove barriers to approval, requiring that the agency consider the ""least burdensome"" means of showing the safety of medical devices, and consider feedback from patients.

36062,An Avalanche of Japanese Shave Ice,"Pastry chefs in the United States are exploring the countless possibilities of kakigori, a traditional dessert that's both exacting and amenable to interpretation.","At Cha-an Teahouse in the East Village, the pastry chef Norie Uematsu serves a white peach kakigori, with peach compote, chewy housemade jellies and syrup.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/19/dining/19shave2/19shave2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=9238aab1580e514e7a00526fdc577d4ea47a16fa152f0072e6c4aadd49fcdae3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/dining/kakigori-japanese-shave-ice.html,a901855e-66e1-5bd1-b778-75dc53845342.jpg,"Before Norie Uematsu became a pastry chef, she waited all year for shave-ice season at home in Japan. Now, she decides when that season begins and ends. At Cha-an Teahouse, in the East Village of New York , Ms. Uematsu serves refreshing bowls of kakigori -- the Japanese shave ice -- as soon as the subway stations are hot and sticky. She turns the handle of her vintage shave-ice machine through the end of September, or until she runs out of ripe white peaches, whichever comes first. All kakigori starts with a block of plain ice. A machine locks the ice in place and spins it against a blade, shaving off soft, sheer flakes. As the ice piles up, kakigori makers add syrups, purees and other sweet toppings. The dessert is endlessly adaptable, which is one reason so many pastry chefs in the United States are not only adding kakigori to their menus but also extending its season.

""To get it really fluffy, you adjust the angle of the blade,"" said Ms. Uematsu, turning an iron knob on her machine. ""But the finer it is, the harder it is to work with."" As the ice melts, or is worn down, the machine must be adjusted to keep the shavings downy. In August, at a cafe in Yamanashi, Japan, I ordered a bowl of kakigori made from a block of natural ice. Someone had delivered it from the Yatsugatake Mountains, a volcanic range to the north. It seemed over the top -- all that labor for a piece of ice? -- but it also testified to the history of kakigori. Before the development of freezers, shave ice was an extravagant dessert reserved only for those who could pay for the luxury of ice carved from frozen lakes and mountains and transported at great cost. As Ms. Uematsu pointed out, kakigori has come a long way from its elite roots in the Heian period (from the end of the eighth through the 12th century). ""When I was a kid, every house in Japan had a cheap kakigori machine, usually with a cute character on it, like Hello Kitty,"" said Ms. Uematsu, who was born in 1980 in Numazu , Shizuoka Prefecture. ""And you could buy commercial syrups for flavoring them.""

But kakigori masters at cafes in Japan can still be fiercely competitive. Many shops have lines out the door, and attentive hosts to manage those lines. Atelier Sekka, a small, serene dessert shop in the Sugamo neighborhood of Tokyo, buys enormous glassy blocks of natural ice from Mount Fuji to use as the base for its pristine mounds of kakigori. On a recent weekday morning, there was an hourlong wait for a seat. She compared the texture of perfect kakigori to flower petals -- not quite powder and not quite grain -- making it distinct from other kinds of shave ice. A vintage shave-ice machine sits at the center of the stylish Tokyo tearoom Higashiya Ginza, where servers layer the shavings with plums poached in honey. At Himitsudo, where you can order while standing in line on the street, cooks turn out bowls overflowing with pureed mango and other fruits. I found my favorite kakigori of the summer at a cafe called Kuriya Kashi Kurogi, on the grounds of the University of Tokyo. The ice was beautifully shaved with an electric machine and saturated with fresh soy milk and sweetened condensed milk, layered with whipped cheese and finally crowned with a thick, sweet and salty puree of fresh edamame. Every now and then, digging around, I hit a ridge of red bean paste.

""It was this ginormous green spectacle that came on a tray, at least 12 inches tall, and it was very intense,"" Ms. Chung recalled. ""I was shocked how it kept its shape despite having all this syrup."" She compared the texture of perfect kakigori to flower petals -- not quite powder and not quite grain -- making it distinct from other kinds of shave ice. ""It's a simple thing that's really hard to execute,"" Ms. Chung said. Stonemill serves a traditional kakigori, ujikintoki, doused with matcha syrup and finished with a touch of sweet red bean paste. Every day, the restaurant's pastry chef, Mikiko Yui, makes coffee jelly and soft mochi to garnish it. The cafe will keep the dessert on the menu through early October. Cha-an Teahouse has been serving ujikintoki and other kinds of kakigori in New York for more than a decade. Ms. Uematsu drew from her own experience with the sweet as well as her training as a chef to develop the white peach kakigori made from poached fruit and decorated with chewy, housemade peach gummies, cut into the shapes of stars and hearts. As he prepared to open the David Chang restaurant Majordomo in Los Angeles in January, the chef de cuisine, Marc Johnson, learned about shave-ice culture through local Korean and Taiwanese shops (cultures which also have rich histories of shave ice) as well as a popular Instagram account run by Margaret Lam. ""She'd go to these kakigori competitions and jams where people would just get together and show off their craft,"" said Mr. Johnson, who does not employ a pastry chef and was eager to figure out the technique. He found that the more delicate the shavings, the faster they melted. Kakigori makers often press the ice very gently with their hands, giving it a distinct rounded shape; but if packed too firmly, those soft, feathery crystals can freeze together as hard, wet clumps.

But a common problem with making kakigori is that the ice can crack on contact with the machine, and the pieces become too small to shave. Mr. Johnson ran into this issue early on. ""They were losing too many blocks,"" Mr. Bellaver said. ""I mean, they would put a block in, and it would shatter."" Like generations of kakigori makers before him, Mr. Johnson learned to temper the ice, leaving it out of the freezer to warm up, so it wouldn't buckle under the pressure of the machine. When Majordomo opened, citrus was in season in California, so Mr. Johnson layered the ice with pieces of blood orange and grapefruit. Later in the year, inspired by the surrounding Mexican restaurants in Los Angeles, he made horchata kakigori, spooning rice pudding into the bottom of each bowl, and squirting the shaved ice with coffee syrup and a strong cold brew made with horchata. He hid pockets of caramelized sweetened condensed milk and whipped cream in its layers. The kitchen can make only one shave ice at a time, and the dessert has been so popular that Mr. Johnson recently added a message to the menu, warning that kakigori can take about 15 minutes to prepare. Orders haven't slowed down."
58438,Diesel Wagon: What'll They Think of Next?,"Volkswagen has been selling vehicles with diesel engines in the United States for years, and it's also brought over the Jetta SportWagen diesel.",The 2014 Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen is rated at 30 m.p.g. in the city and 40 on the highway with the automatic transmission.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/20/automobiles/BLOCK/BLOCK-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=334&w=600&s=f02fdd5f6ffbfbc87674100054eb8e61520e749ed031776d46aca16462d60ab3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/automobiles/autoreviews/diesel-wagon-whatll-they-think-of-next.html,8277cdf4-1eba-59ec-b11d-56aaa58932a3.jpg,"WHAT IS IT? One of only two diesel station wagons sold in the United States. HOW MUCH? $30,290 for 2013 model as tested with sunroof, navigation system and 17-inch wheels. Base price of 2014 TDI wagon is $27,070. WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD? 2-liter 4-cylinder diesel (140 horsepower, 236 pound-feet of torque) with a 6-speed automated direct-shift gearbox. IS IT THIRSTY? No, and that's the whole point: the E.P.A. rating is 29 m.p.g. in the city, 39 m.p.g. on the highway (or 30/42 with the standard 6-speed manual transmission).

If you need proof that the press is not all-powerful in shaping public opinion, check out the car market. Auto writers have long tooted the horn about the benefits of diesel engines, and a bunch of them have also argued that the old-school station wagon is a far more efficient way to haul things around than a bloated high-set S.U.V. Nonetheless, two things that American car buyers have spurned are diesels and wagons. Yet maybe because Volkswagen officials fell for the car talk, or because they believe the times are changing -- or indeed because the times are changing -- the company is now selling a diesel station wagon in the United States. So when it was time to pop up for my 50th high-school reunion (gulp!) in Connecticut, I thought a Jetta SportWagen TDI would be just the conveyance for a plunge back into the future. I envisioned rattling up Route 7 trailed by a black cloud -- and then running out of fuel at the 10th gas station without a diesel pump -- as a perfect echo of those halcyon days.

Seriously, though, I live in France, where station wagons are quite popular and almost everyone drives diesels -- including me, by choice, whenever I rent a car. I simply do not see the point of burning euros on gasoline, especially when the far higher torque of a turbodiesel can be quite entertaining. (Check out the winners of the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race the last eight years.)

And the black smoke is a thing of the past. The only reminder that a modern diesel engine is burning oil is a faint rattle under the hood and the smell on your hands when you eventually do have to fill the tank. Alas, the diesel wagon test car never made it to school; a friendly neighbor backed into the front fender, and VW didn't have another Jetta test car available. I completed the trip in a Passat diesel sedan, which has the same engine and 6-speed DSG automatic transmission, but is a notch grander in accouterments, length (by a foot) and weight (by 211 pounds), and somehow gets slightly better mileage (rated 30/40 with the automatic and 31/43 with the manual). The Passat was great for eating up highway miles and avoiding gas stations, but the comparison helped to convince me that the Jetta wagon better represents traditional VW values. It seems the wiser substitute for the ubiquitous suburban S.U.V. I should note here that the Jetta SportWagen has not been subjected to the decontenting of other Jettas for the American market. I've not driven those, but the SportWagen remains pleasantly close in driving feel and quality to its Golf sibling, which has not been downgraded. My Toffee Brown test wagon with ""cornsilk leatherette"" interior (marketing-speak for brown with admirably leatherlike tan vinyl) was the top trim level, with sunroof, navigation system, rearview camera and keyless ignition as the big attractions. Beyond that was a rather comprehensive and typically (for VW) convenient array of the power accessories and electronic driving aids you'd expect in a $30,000 car. I really liked the clean, uncluttered design, and VWs have always had a neat, functional and intuitive interior layout. The seats were supportive and amply adjustable, and the back seat folded in a 60-40 split. In short, it was all nicely finished and laid out. But let's be honest, all this can be said of a lot of cars today.

What would nudge me toward investing in the SportWagen is, first, the TDI engine. I didn't have the Jetta long enough to do my own reckoning of its fuel economy, but the two diesels I drove gave no reason to question the E.P.A. figures on the window sticker, including a combined city-highway rating of 33 m.p.g. That's hybrid territory, with a single-tank driving range of over 500 miles. That economy also comes with a big surge of power at low engine speeds, conveying a typically diesel sense of a lot more power than the horsepower figures suggest. On a twisty road, the SportWagen confirmed that it was not a GTI, but it was a lot more fun than the crossover utility wagons I've driven. And the three gas stations I pulled into at random in Connecticut and on the New Jersey Turnpike all had diesel, though admittedly in the price range of premium-grade gasoline. The second attraction is, yes, the time-tested advantages of the wagon body style. The wagon was banished from suburbia when it became overly associated with runs to Safeway and the soccer field, but of course the reason the wagon was so popular in the day was precisely because it was so convenient for grocery and soccer runs. Nobody believes any longer that you need a Chevy Equinox in your driveway for combat duty, so why not get a car that offers as much or more space in the back (nearly 33 cubic feet with the rear seats up, and 67 cubic feet with the seats folded), gets far better gas mileage and is a hoot to drive?"
27420,From Camera Roll to Canvas: Make Art From Your Photos,"Several apps transform a memorable portrait or vacation shot into a ""painting"" suitable for hanging over the couch or sharing this holiday season.",Apps like Prisma use sophisticated filters to turn ordinary photographs into digital artwork in a variety of painting and illustration styles.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/technology/personaltech/04TECHTIP_TOPART/04TECHTIP_TOPART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bd87226e25af97248e4a6e365d69a2507ff874534d4a07a44c999a1d7c813f7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/technology/personaltech/turn-photos-into-paintings.html,9757d722-f4d7-52ec-80db-31a8b5f93f7d.jpg,"Tired of the usual attention-getting filters you use to make your photos pop with stronger contrast or deeper color saturation? If you want to make a different type of eye-catching picture, consider an app that turns your images into artwork. With the right app, you can render your favorite photo into a digital version of paint on canvas, giving it a whole new look and feel. But you don't have to stop there: You can print your creation on canvas for home display or as a unique gift. And you can do it all on your smartphone or tablet. Here's how. App stores are overflowing with photo-filter programs. To find one that makes your pictures look like handcrafted brushwork, narrow your search by using the keyword ""paintings"" or ""art.""

Popular apps in the category include Deep Art Effects, which uses artificial intelligence to analyze the photo and apply a filter; the free app works on Android and iOS but offers in-app purchases of additional filters and other features for about $4. Prisma, a similar app for Android and iOS, has a free trial and a $30 annual subscription fee. If you favor the look of watercolors, the $5 Waterlogue for iOS may appeal. Other inexpensive options include the free (but aggressively ad-supported) Art Filter Photo Editor for Android. Visionist for iOS is also free, with in-app upgrades; the same developer makes the $3 Oilist for iOS as well. The versatile Brushstroke for iOS is $4, and additional paint styles can be purchased within the app. Next, find your favorite vacation shot, pet portrait or other sentimental snap on your phone (or import it from a camera or computer). Make sure its resolution is high enough to print clearly at a large size. With recent smartphones capturing images at eight, 12 and even 16 megapixels, fuzziness shouldn't be a problem. On a phone, you can check an image's size and dimensions by opening the file and tapping in the More menu in Google Photos, far left, or viewing the image in the iOS Files app, near left.

The printing service you use should provide guidelines for files sizes. To check the size and dimensions of an image, open the file in Google Photos or in Apple's iOS Files app. Your art app may also include standard tools for adjusting a photo's color and contrast. If not, use your device's regular image-editing program, like Apple's Photos or Google Photos.

Take a moment and check the composition of the shot you want to use. If you'd like the subject to be more prominent, use the app's cropping tool to bring the focus front and center. Cropping also trims out clutter in the background of your shot, like that other tourist who wandered into your camera frame. Take your time to play around with the available filters and try out different looks for your image. Many programs supply dozens of variations that can make your photo look like a 17th-century oil painting or modern manga art -- and just about every style in between.

Once you have finished fussing with filters and saved your creation at the highest resolution possible, it's time to turn it into physical art. Prices vary by size and printing surface, and you may be able to order a print of your image on canvas right from the app itself. For instance, Deep Art Effects and Brushstroke include their own stores, and you can even order canvas prints right from Google Photos starting at around $20. Deep Art Effects is among the photo-filter apps that allow you to upload your finished artwork and buy prints, posters and other items. If your app doesn't include printing options, sites like Canvas World and Easy Canvas Prints offer high-quality reproductions. Just upload your image file, place your order and pay. General photo-printing services like Snapfish and Shutterfly also create canvas prints, and you can output your pictures on posters, cards, mugs and other gift items. Drugstores like CVS and Walgreens have similar output offerings."
48285,"To Beat Go Champion, Google's Program Needed a Human Army","Without the multitude of minds that created a program capable of beating a Go game master, the contest would have been a no-go.","Lee Se-dol, a professional Go player from South Korea, was smiling amid other players despite losing four of five games against a Google computer program called AlphaGo.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/05/science/25JOHNSONSUB/25JOHNSONSUB-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=9b42ea5ebc3f11f4854adc112339efbd99c428ba7d2c408e0dd4bdfe23e3ac1d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/science/google-alphago-artificial-intelligence.html,41ccbc05-da8e-56dc-bdb3-d38670cd7725.jpg,"Nearly 20 years ago, after a chess-playing computer called Deep Blue beat the world grandmaster Garry Kasparov, I wrote an article about why humans would long remain the champions in the game of Go. ""It may be a hundred years before a computer beats humans at Go -- maybe even longer,"" Dr. Piet Hut, an astrophysicist and Go enthusiast at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., told me in 1997. ""If a reasonably intelligent person learned to play Go, in a few months he could beat all existing computer programs. You don't have to be a Kasparov."" That was the prevailing wisdom. Last month, after a Google computer program called AlphaGo defeated the Go master Lee Se-dol, I asked Dr. Hut for his reaction. ""I was way off, clearly, with my prediction,"" he replied in an email. ""It's really stunning."" At the time, his pessimism seemed well founded. While Deep Blue had been trained and programmed by IBM with some knowledge about chess, its advantage lay primarily in what computer scientists call brute-force searching. At each step of the game Deep Blue would rapidly look ahead, exploring a maze of hypothetical moves and countermoves and counter-countermoves. Then it would make the choice that its algorithms ranked as the best. No living brain could possibly move so fast.

Of course, computers became ever more powerful. But even today's fastest aren't able to anticipate all of the permutations of a situation like playing Go. Success on this and other fronts has come from harnessing speed in other ways. The breakthrough in translation came from setting aside the question of what it means to understand a language and just finding a technology that works. The automated systems start with a text that has already been translated, by human brains. Then both versions are fed to a computer. By rapidly comparing the two, the machine compiles a thicket of statistical correlations, associating words and phrases with their likely foreign counterparts. Similar approaches, more artificial than intelligent, have led to surprisingly rapid improvements in recognizing speech and facial images, as well as with playing championship Go. In AlphaGo, learning algorithms, called deep neural nets, were trained using a database of millions of moves made in the past by human players. Then it refined this knowledge by playing one split-second game after another against itself. Tweak by algorithmic tweak, it became ever more adept at the game. By combining this insensate learning, which amounts to many human lifetimes of experience, with a technique called Monte Carlo tree search, named for the ability to randomly sample a universe of possible moves, AlphaGo prevailed. That was an enormous victory. But the glory goes not to the computer program but to the human brains that pulled it off. At the end of the tournament in Seoul, South Korea, 15 of them took the stage. They represented just a fraction of the number of people it took to invent and execute all of the technologies involved. Lee Se-dol was playing against an army.

Back in 1997 I wrote, ""To play a decent game of Go, a computer must be endowed with the ability to recognize subtle, complex patterns and to draw on the kind of intuitive knowledge that is the hallmark of human intelligence."" Defeating a human Go champion, I wrote, ""will be a sign that artificial intelligence is truly beginning to become as good as the real thing."" That doesn't seem so true anymore. Ingenious learning algorithms combined with ""big data"" have led to impressive accomplishments -- what has even been called bottled intuition. But artificial intelligence is far from rivaling the fluidity of the human mind. ""Humans can learn to recognize patterns on a Go board -- and patterns related to faces and patterns in language -- and even patterns of patterns,"" said Melanie Mitchell, a computer scientist at Portland State University and the Santa Fe Institute. ""This is what we do every second of every day. But AlphaGo only recognizes patterns related to Go boards and has no ability to generalize beyond that -- even to games similar to Go but with different rules. ""Also, it takes millions of training examples for AlphaGo to learn to recognize patterns,"" she continued, ""whereas it only seems to take humans a few."" Computer scientists are experimenting with programs that can generalize far more efficiently. But the squishy neural nets in our heads -- shaped by half a billion years of evolution and given a training set as big as the world -- can still hold their own against ultra-high-speed computers designed by teams of humans, programmed for a single purpose and given an enormous head start. ""It was a regrettable game, but I enjoyed it,"" Mr. Lee said during the award ceremony. (Regret, enjoy -- these words do not compute.) He added that the contest ""clearly showed my weaknesses, but not the weakness of humanity."" Picking up the plaque and bouquet he had been given as consolation prizes, he laughed nervously and stumbled from the stage. Several days later, he said he would like a rematch."

Several major insurers have said they cannot begin to decide whether to offer coverage next year until the government clarifies if and how it plans to change the rules.

Based in Louisville, Ky., Humana is not a major player in the individual exchanges and is among the national insurers, like Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, that have struggled to make money in the market. The company has steadily scaled back its presence, selling policies for 2017 in just 11 states. In early January, the company said the number of its customers buying coverage through the exchanges had dropped to about 150,000, a small fraction of the roughly 12 million individuals who initially signed up for coverage through the exchanges.

The company's main focus has been selling private insurance under Medicare. Humana released word of its withdrawal on Tuesday after it announced that it would no longer pursue a merger with Aetna, another large insurer. The Justice Department won a legal challenge against the combination last month.

The company cited an ""initial analysis of data"" about the type of customers who signed up for its plans this year, and it said that it saw no evidence that the market was improving but that it was ""seeing further signs of an unbalanced risk pool,"" as customers with expensive medical conditions continued to enroll as compared with healthy people.

Humana's move ""could be a harbinger of things to come,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University who studies the health insurance market and who has warned that the lack of clarity from Congress and the Trump administration could result an exodus by insurers."

23959,When Good Boys Say Bad Words,"The filmmakers behind the new comedy ""Good Boys,"" about potty-mouthed sixth-graders, had to figure out how to handle stars who were too young to actually see the movie.","From left, Keith L.

In one of the first scenes, 12-year-old Max (Jacob Tremblay of ""Room,""), playing in his bedroom, enhances a female video-game character to make her breasts larger. ""Fudge, yeah!"" he says enthusiastically, except with a much saltier word in place of that ""fudge."" That sets the stage for a raunchy yet sincere movie that feels something like ""Superbad"" meets ""The Sandlot,"" by way of ""American Pie."" Making their feature debuts, Brady Noon and Keith L. Williams star alongside Tremblay as sixth-grade buddies who call themselves the Bean Bag Boys. The movie , which opens Aug. 16, follows them on a one-day adventure that has them spying on high-school girls, skipping school, going to kissing parties and cursing like sailors. It is the latest example of movies that have put naughty language into the mouths of youngsters to comic effect. In the 2010 action comedy ""Kick-Ass,"" Chloe Grace Moretz, 11 at the time of filming, used harsh words and harsher violence when playing Hit Girl , which rankled some critics. In the 2008 comedy ""Role Models,"" Bobb'e J. Thompson spouted expletives like a fountain, and in the 1986 R-rated ""Stand by Me,"" its preteens used profanity liberally. ""Good Boys"" has plenty in common with that film , but more than its predecessors, it derives considerable humor from the characters' mistaken or uninformed views of sexuality. The filmmakers had to discover for themselves how to handle 11- and 12-year-olds delivering very adult dialogue on risque topics. In some cases, the solution involved their parents.

The movie, which was well received at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March, comes from the writers Gene Stupnitsky, 41, who also directed, and Lee Eisenberg, 42. They have known each other for 20 years , writing on ""The Office"" and penning the 2011 comedy ""Bad Teacher."" In conceiving the ""Good Boys"" screenplay to get the most mileage out of their kids-say-the-darndest-things premise, they remembered what their lives were like when they were their characters' age.

""We thought about first kisses, peer pressure, bullying and all the other stuff that we experienced,"" Eisenberg said in an interview at The Times. ""Usually when you see these types of movies, it's the Disney version of it. And we thought, what if it wasn't that?"" When one of the boys finds a tampon and doesn't know what it is, another boy explains, based on information from an eighth-grader, that girls put them in their bottoms to keep their babies from falling out. Or for a joke about a nymphomaniac, one boy supplies a definition: ""someone who has sex on land and sea.""

""We gave them no context,"" Eisenberg said. ""We didn't say to them, this is a sex doll. They would ask questions and we would say, 'Ask your parents.'"" ""Also, the great thing about having 11-year-old actors is that you can give them line readings that you wouldn't be able to give Daniel Day-Lewis,"" Stupnitsky said. ""You can tell them, 'Say it exactly like this.'"" The language got cleaner once the scene was over. In a phone interview, Tremblay broke down how he thought about the job. ""Max swears, Jacob doesn't,"" he said. ""When I'm on set playing the character, I'm allowed to swear. But when I'm at my house, I'm just Jacob, who's not allowed to swear. When Jacob swears, then he gets grounded."" The actor said that he also didn't share adult information that he might have known with other kids on the set. ""We would only talk about inappropriate stuff with our parents,"" he said, ""because some kids don't know certain things, and some kids' parents don't want them to know certain things yet."" During the casting process, a few parents were uncomfortable with the language and didn't want their children in the movie, the filmmakers recalled. And one boy would not use swear words during his audition, even though they were in the scene he was reading. ""It was like watching the airplane version of your movie,"" Eisenberg said.

Naughty language is a specialty of the film's producers, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, whose scripts for ""Superbad"" and ""This Is the End"" featured steady streams of profanity. But they said they loved that the screenplay for ""Good Boys"" gave greater weight to the childhood crises these kids experienced. ""There's nothing funnier than stakes that seem really high to the character, but are not in actuality all that high in the grand scale,"" Rogen said by phone. While the producers helped develop the screenplay, they said they didn't make its language raunchier than what was there originally. ""It was already fundamentally in the fabric of the project,"" Goldberg said. ""And it is, in our experience, how kids that age actually talk when their parents aren't looking."" While the crude humor is a selling point -- in the red-band trailer, Rogen explains to the kids that they're too young to watch the promo -- its creators didn't want the movie to get too bogged down in the fact that preteen boys are dropping F-bombs. ""As we were editing the movie, we started stripping some of the language away,"" Eisenberg said. ""If it wasn't elevating a joke, or feeling like something a kid would say, we thought too much of it would sound like white noise. ""When we wrote the movie, the goal of it was to make it funny and put the kids in situations that are both relatable and comedically heightened. But hopefully people like the movie beyond thinking, this kid said ..."" Well, this family newspaper can't say what he said."
11939,Will Oracle Solve Trump's TikTok Problem?,"Forcing the unspooling of a complex global company is not as easy as yelling about the ""China menace.""",Oracle has emerged as the leading contender to save TikTok from impending restrictions from the Trump administration.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/15/opinion/15swisherWeb/15swisherWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fbb0e4636a7da1c134d583e188a5de93aece655959a1dc18c8b3b792cc90f33f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/opinion/oracle-trump-tiktok.html,f9855253-864a-57b5-b958-d1632a47b016.jpg,"Sometimes, when I am feeling particularly ornery, I think that Oracle is like the Kid Rock of tech: Among the least compelling of digital celebrities in Silicon Valley, this 43-year-old business software giant always seems willing to show up at the White House and enthusiastically do whatever the Trump administration wants. Join transition committees and business round tables, even as other tech executives hold their noses or flee in horror over President Trump's immigration bans? Sure! Fund-raising for the president's re-election at the swanky California digs of its puckish founder Larry Ellison? But of course! Set up a database for tracking Covid-19 treatments, even if the controversial and potentially dangerous hydroxychloroquine information pushed by Mr. Trump is to be loaded up on it? Sign us up! You can chalk up Oracle's bear hug of the Trump administration -- and vice versa -- as business as usual, and maybe it is. Or you might be inclined to pillory Oracle for cravenly sucking up to an administration with more than its fair share of grifters.

That's still a big if. The deal was supposed to be an outright acquisition by an American company, as ordered by Mr. Trump this summer, as he fretted about the security risks of a Chinese company owning a digital platform -- and all the personal data that comes with it -- that is wildly popular with young Americans. Microsoft showed interest in buying the company. That fell through, and last weekend Oracle emerged as TikTok's U.S. partner. The deal will have to be approved by Mr. Trump -- who had some nice words to say about Mr. Ellison on Tuesday. And it must be reviewed by national security experts and the powerful interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which weighs national security risks of making deals with foreign entities. From what we know so far, and things may change, ByteDance would apparently remain the actual owner of the magical recommendation algorithm used by TikTok, whose misfortune amid all of its popularity is to be owned by a company based in China at a political moment when being a Chinese company with 100 million American users is not ideal.

Why You Should Care About TikTok Forcing a sale of the app is a show of power, but it doesn't really protect your privacy. ""Good morning, y'all. It's Charli."" ""Playing a little catch with myself."" There are roughly a hundred million Americans who regularly use TikTok, the social media app where you can create and share short videos on everything, from dancing to coding. But our government claims it's dangerous since it's owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. ""President Trump said he will ban TikTok here in the United States, unless it is able to agree to a sale."" And this just in, the Trump administration is blocking all U.S. downloads of Chinese-owned apps TikTok and WeChat starting this Sunday. You may be thinking, who cares? But for us, TikTok is so much more than just another app. ""Hey guys, a lot of you have been asking for a hair tutorial. So first, we're going to arrest Breonna Taylor's murderers."" I use TikTok to talk about Black Lives Matter and so many other social issues to spread a message and get the word across. Through TikTok alone, I've registered thousands of people to vote in the past few months. ""Things people don't understand about the dark web."" I started posting videos for fun under quarantine, about technology and cybersecurity. I post videos of slapstick comedy. TikTok opened so many doors for me. It's my career. ""Gimme some!"" [MUSIC] ""Ow! Ow! You're not supposed to really hit me!"" ""Oh!"" TikTok is huge. It's the most downloaded app. Ordering TikTok to be sold to an American company actually worries me. A sale doesn't guarantee that it will be kept intact or that the algorithm will be included. Without the algorithm the entire use experience will be changed. Trump claims a sale is meant to protect our data. But it's really the government dictating how we are allowed to use the internet while they pretend like they're protecting us. If the government really cares about privacy, regulate TikTok -- don't destroy it. Let's back up a bit. ""Back it up, back, back it up. Back it up--"" What is TikTok, anyways? ""TikTok is very successful. It's an amazing thing, whatever it may be."" O.K. Everybody thinks TikTok is just dancing preteens or kids doing weird stuff, like-- ""TikTok famous! Ah!"" ""Mi Pan, (SCATTING)."" But it's so much more than that. Those hit songs you listened to in the past year? These ones? ""I'm going to ride horse down to the old town road"" ""I'm a savage."" --a lot of them blew up because of TikTok. TikTok creators are influential comedians and activists and dancers and singers and doctors. And even people who support the guy trying to ban it. ""Because I am pro-America, I support someone who is pro-America."" If TikTok is banned or altered, I lose my entire network. I lose my livelihood. I'm 17 and I can't vote. So if TikTok is taken away I don't have a platform to talk about things that matter to me and so many other young people in this country. In the midst of a global pandemic, amongst other serious domestic issues, why does the government care about an app? Maybe it's because some TikTokers claim to have pranked the president, and it hurt his feelings. ""the fallout this morning from President Trump's more than half empty rally in Tulsa. Did TikTok teens help spoil the president's return to the campaign trail?"" Or because he wants to appear tough on China. Or maybe it's because the government is worried the TikTok will allow China to collect American data. Do I have concerns about app security, and about TikTok specifically? I think about this all the time. Absolutely yes. I've even made videos on TikTok calling out and denouncing China's horrific human rights record. I understand why we should be concerned. Despite the fact that American intelligence found no evidence that TikTok was sharing data with the Chinese government, and TikTok claims it stores the data outside of China-- We should keep a close eye on the company. But we should also be keeping an eye on all tech companies, including American ones. Forcing a sale of this one app doesn't solve our overall privacy problems. Even if you don't care about us, you should care how this is an attack on self-expression, an abuse of power, and an attempt to limit what we can access on the internet. Right now, it's TikTok. What's next? Forcing a sale of the app is a show of power, but it doesn't really protect your privacy.

That's what set the battle over TikTok in motion, which culminated in an executive order by Mr. Trump that it must be sold or be banned in the United States this week, before China presumably downloaded all the data from our dance-crazy teenagers (Mr. Trump, of course, has offered no proof that Beijing is sucking up user data). It's a much more complex story than that, of course, part of a worldwide battle with China for hegemony over the next tech age. And there are indeed legitimate concerns about giving a Chinese company access to data, as well as about potential back doors and also the more subtle power that Beijing could acquire to deliver propaganda to Americans through an entertainment app. There is no question that the issues of Chinese influence and surveillance should be top of mind for any democratic government -- and a cogent and broad-ranging policy of how to deal with Beijing is necessary. But this is not that. What we have been left with after all the gnashing of teeth and tearing out of orange hair is a lot of sound and fury that appears to signify very little. The terms of an Oracle deal remain unclear. There is some talk of a kind of separately carved out TikTok for the United States, with an American board and majority American investors, but what is still troublingly opaque is who exactly would own and control the critical code for TikTok. Several tech leaders told me that this half-baked solution came about because, as usual, our hair-trigger president was over his skis in making his TikTok declarations this summer. It eventually began to sink in with the Trump administration that forcing an American acquisition and the unspooling of a complex global company are not as easy as yelling about the ""China menace.""

For one, many of the investors in ByteDance are very powerful venture capitalists based in the United States, none of whom wanted to be forced to sell their stake through a discounted fire sale orchestrated by Mr. Trump (and several are major Republican supporters). The early front-runner in the deal, Microsoft, found itself outmatched by Oracle, which was a big surprise for many analysts. Along with Amazon and Google, Microsoft is a top player in the cloud-services business, with Oracle well behind in both business size and talent. While Oracle recently scored a win as the cloud-service provider for the pandemically popular Zoom, Microsoft was seen as the obvious choice to take over TikTok by those who understand the technological challenge it will be to strip it of Chinese influence. Microsoft seemed to take Mr. Trump at his word that he wanted a sale, and numerous sources said its offer was a full takeover of TikTok's U.S. business. ""Microsoft wanted complete control,"" said one insider. That had become problematic after China decided to potentially block the transfer of TikTok's recommendation algorithm outside the country. It was a boss move, roughly akin to letting someone sell a car, but without its engine. With that face-off, there had to be a quick shift to a new plan that could satisfy everyone. So, under the new deal, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that Oracle would be a ""trusted technology partner."" I am not sure what that means -- and neither does anyone else. (The Genius Bar at Apple is my trusted technology partner.) Is this just a matter of Oracle overseeing American operations and getting some stock? Or would it be a worldwide deployment for Oracle with huge control of the service? Or would Oracle be just a dressed-up provider of cloud services, an overpaid babysitter of data, a rent-a-cop serving the mall of memes? Mr. Mnuchin also sounded some loud politically motivated bells and whistles -- like promises of American jobs and a new U.S. headquarters. But those things were already happening before this hubbub started. There had been talk of a possible spinoff and U.S. public offering by TikTok, which might have resulted in the same outcome had Mr. Trump not intervened (there might still be an I.P.O. in the future)."
4806,How to Make Whipped Coffee,Dalgona coffee is having a moment on social media. Here's how you can prepare it for yourself at home.,Instant coffee whipped with sugar and water and poured over milk has become an internet sensation in recent months.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/dining/08whippedcoffee-drink/08whippedcoffee-drink-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/article/whipped-coffee-recipe.html,063acbde-9f05-530e-9182-3eb9abee835c.jpg,"You may have seen it on Instagram or TikTok: a creamy, two-toned coffee drink amid the posts of push-up challenges, men growing mustaches and calls to draw a vegetable with your nose.

Known as whipped coffee, or dalgona coffee, the drink is made by whipping instant coffee with sugar and water, resulting in a butterscotch-hued foam that's spooned over milk.

It first gained prominence in South Korea in January, after the actor Jung Il-woo tried it in Macau for ""Stars' Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant,"" a popular television show. On the show, he said it reminded him of a South Korean honeycomb toffee confection called dalgona, giving it its name -- and some traction. After the show aired, the drink went viral in South Korea, and has become a staple menu item in a number of coffee shops there.

""I never expected dalgona coffee to get this popular,"" Mr. Jung said in an interview conducted through direct messages on Instagram."
384,This Bond Wears Corduroy,"The super spy is getting a new look, courtesy of the Italian designer Massimo Alba.","Daniel Craig as James Bond, wearing a corduroy jacket designed by Massimo Alba, in a scene from the trailer of the new James Bond movie &ldquo;No Time to Die.&rdquo;",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/16/fashion/10Bond-daniel-craig/10Bond-daniel-craig-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=ecbd4c63c010e1b85e7b0d3d5adcee00739bfea5f474208d37487e7f3c656fab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/style/james-bond-daniel-craig-suits.html,cc1ad78e-ee9e-562a-b593-3e20de952155.jpg,"Daniel Craig as James Bond, wearing a corduroy jacket designed by Massimo Alba, in a scene from the trailer of the new James Bond movie ""No Time to Die.""





MILAN -- James Bond has an unexpected weapon in the forthcoming espionage flick, ""No Time to Die."" What? The famously slick Tom Ford tuxedo-clad super spy invented by Ian Fleming now wearing the fuddy-duddy fabric most often associated with 1970s literature professors? Yes, if the trailer for the April release, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (""True Detective"") and with script tweaks by Phoebe Waller-Bridge (""Fleabag""), is anything to go by. But then, this cord is not exactly the look of the cord of yore.

Even Mr. Alba was surprised by the sartorial choice, saying he assumed the whole thing was a joke when he received an email last March from Jane Gooday, the film's head costume buyer at Pinewood Studios, outside London. ""I spoke with my personal trainer that morning and he couldn't believe it,"" Mr. Alba said. ""He told me not to get my hopes up, that maybe I wouldn't even get to see my clothes in the film."" After receiving the look books for Mr. Alba's spring 2019 and fall 2019 collections, the studio ordered 30 suits, raincoats and trousers from the spring styles, each in three European sizes -- 50, 52 and 54. The unlined Sloop suit came in what Mr. Alba called ""Desert,"" a sandy hue; the duster coat in ""Agades,"" a moss-green color named after the Niger city Agadez; and the pants in a gray shade called ""Alluminio"" or aluminum. And the studio paid the bill -- though Mr. Alba declined to say just how much it was. For this was no big-budget product placement deal. Mr. Alba, 59, who started his business in 2006 after stints at the knitwear labels Ballantyne and Malo, has no marketing department or digital communications division (he posts on Instagram himself, where he has about -- 14,400 followers). He has six stores in Italy, wholesales to 130 stores worldwide and hosts presentations in his atelier during Milan's men's fashion weeks.

Yet from his showroom tucked away in Milan's Navigli canal district, the soft-spoken, bespectacled designer, a reluctant name-dropper, has dressed such celebrities as Leonardo DiCaprio, James Franco, Stanley Tucci, Ian McKellen, and -- yes -- the current Bond, Daniel Craig. It was Mr. Craig, Ms. Gooday said, who suggested that they seek out Mr. Alba for the film wardrobe. The actor ""had bought a pair of the designer's needlecord jeans for his personal life,"" she wrote in an email, and clearly liked them. As to why, well, Mr. Alba ""doesn't do mood boards or second-guess the season's fashionable color,"" said David Coggins, author of the 2016 book ""Men and Style."" But, ""he's a very enlightened designer, perfect for this enlightened Bond."" This is a Bond, after all, that comes post-#MeToo and post-Brexit. ""The world has moved on, Commander Bond,"" a female agent, played by Lashana Lynch, says in an online teaser. So how to give Bond a blast of the contemporary? Enter Mr. Alba. ""Informality is the key to my label,"" said Mr. Alba, with his 10-year-old golden Labrador, Jasper, at his feet. ""There's nothing pressed or rigid,"" he said of the watercolor-hued garments hanging around him. According to Bruce Pask, men's fashion director at Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, ""Massimo's corduroy suit is deconstructed, unlined and soft. It reflects the uniform of contract worker today, or the freelance and creative class.""

Indeed, previous criticism of the Bond's wardrobe in the 2015 ""Spectre"" centered on the somewhat constricting look of Mr. Craig's Ford suits. On Matt Spaiser's site, The Suits of James Bond, there are several threads devoted to the spy's sartorial choices. ""Daniel Craig's suits in 'Skyfall' and 'Spectre' are clearly too tight and should look better than they do when he stands in relaxed manner,"" Mr. Spaiser wrote. ""His suits don't move well with him, and his trousers are so tight that they split on the set."" Mr. Alba sees the turn from the Ford and Brioni suits of past Bonds to his styles as evolution. ""Bond wore them like a suit of armor,"" he said. ""They were very rigid. Mine isn't linked to that James Bond legacy, but I feel closer to this ideal of a man; he's more poetic, and doesn't need to hide behind his suits. He has a newfound confidence."" And Mr. Spaiser said Mr. Alba's work would provide collectors with an opportunity: ""They're much cheaper than a Tom Ford."" (Mr. Alba's Sloop suit retails for about $1,000; a Tom Ford wool suit is online for $3,960.) For Mr. Spaiser, whose site receives 30,000 visitors a month, and usually sees a spike ahead of the franchise's latest release, ""Bond in an off-duty suit implies a man who appreciates clothes. If you're wearing a cord suit, it means you don't have to wear a suit, it's because you want to wear it."""

What books are on your nightstand? I am a few pages from the end of Tom Holland's marvelously readable ""Rubicon"" and about a quarter of the way through Mary Beard's somewhat more earnest ""SPQR."" Those were part of my challenge to myself this year to get better educated about the fall of the Roman Republic. I'm still dipping into Maya Jasanoff's beautifully written travels in the footsteps of Conrad, ""The Dawn Watch."" Newcomers to the nightstand, which were both recommended to me by friends: ""China in Ten Words,"" by Yu Hua and ""Lives Other Than My Own,"" by Emmanuel Carrere. Tell us about the last great book you read. Great in the sense of ""up there with the Columbia Core""?I would nominate ""2084,"" by the Algerian writer Boualem Sansal. As a vision of Islamic totalitarianism, it is blood-chilling. But it is also a masterly piece of writing. What's the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? I was rather fascinated to read in Tom Holland's book about Baiae, the Roman resort on the Gulf of Naples which was the Roman equivalent of the Hamptons or Malibu, complete with that combination of sexual libertinism and dietary epicureanism which I associate with certain members of today's American elite.

What's the best book on economics? And the best work of economic history? The best book I've read recently on economics was probably Ian Kumekawa's ""The First Serious Optimist: A. C. Pigou and the Birth of Welfare Economics."" Amongst recent economic history books I would have to pick Chris Miller's very insightful ""The Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy: Mikhail Gorbachev and the Collapse of the USSR,"" which shows why the Russians could not achieve in the 1980s what the Chinese did achieve, namely (partial) escape from the pathologies of the planned economy. Of course, economists and economic historians these days are discouraged from writing books. Most of what I consume in these fields comes in the form of working papers and journal articles. What books do you think best captures your own political principles? I suppose it would have to be Edmund Burke's ""Reflections on the Revolution in France."" I wish I could force-feed -- or perhaps force-read -- it to every progressive who is convinced that her latest untested and hare-brained policy initiative will magically eliminate inequality, discrimination, climate change and all the rest, without any unintended consequences for individual liberty. Do you and your wife, the activist and writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali, share similar taste in books? What books has she recommended to you, and vice versa? Very similar, so books frequently cross the bedroom from one nightstand to the other. A good example was Hayek's ""The Constitution of Liberty,"" her favorite work of political philosophy, which she urged me to read. I recently gave her Tom Holland's ""Dynasty,"" the sequel to ""Rubicon,"" and of course his ""In the Shadow of the Sword: The Birth of Islam and the Rise of the Global Arab Empire,"" which I am waiting my turn to read after her. Which books do you think capture the current social and political moment in America? I shared the widespread enthusiasm for J. D. Vance's ""Hillbilly Elegy"" last year, but the must-read book for Trump's election and presidency remains Charles Murray's astonishingly prescient ""Coming Apart."" I wish the contemptible ""students"" who disrupted his lecture at Middlebury College earlier this year -- not one of whom I'll bet had ever read a word of his -- would read ""Coming Apart"" and then look in the mirror and realize: ""Oh God, I'm a member of that loathsome coastal cognitive elite that is completely out of touch with middle America.""

Which fiction and nonfiction writers -- playwrights, critics, journalists, poets -- inspired you most early in your career? And which writers working today do you most admire? I'd have to begin with A. J. P. Taylor, who was the first historian I ever read and who inspired me to believe a) that historical writing should never be dull, but should bristle with irony and paradox, and b) that historical knowledge is a prerequisite for worthwhile commentary on contemporary matters. Another major influence at the early stage was Norman Stone. But it wasn't just historians who inspired me as I was starting out. As a sixth-former (high school senior), I lapped up Tom Stoppard's plays, painted a mural inspired by the poetry of Thom Gunn and read compulsively the reviews of punk bands in the New Musical Express. At Oxford, I came under the influence of The Spectator, then edited by Charles Moore, one of the most gifted English journalists of his generation and now Margaret Thatcher's biographer. But my favorite writer at that time was Flann O'Brien, the great Irish humorist. I have always liked his description of himself as ""a spoilt Proust."" No one writing in English today is remotely as funny as O'Brien. Only the French can still produce real men of letters. Chapeau, therefore, to Bernard-Henri Levy and Michel Houellebecq. Which historians and biographers do you most admire? Amongst those currently writing, Simon Schama stands out as the Dickens of modern historiography: bewilderingly erudite and prolific, passionate in his enthusiasms and armed with the complete contents of the thesaurus. We agree to disagree about politics. I have also hugely admired Anne Applebaum for her trilogy on the Gulag, the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe (""Iron Curtain"") and, most recently, the Ukrainian famine (""Red Famine""). Walter Isaacson has established himself as the great American biographer of our time. ""Leonardo da Vinci"" is his best book, I think. Whereas the earlier books were pure journalism, he is now showing academic scholars how to write accessibly about subtle and even recondite subject matter. I read quite a number of biographies while researching ""The Square and the Tower."" My favorite was probably Michael Ignatieff's on Isaiah Berlin, which led me into the vast, delightful rabbit warren of Berlin's correspondence. And which novelists do you especially enjoy reading? Everyone has at least one vice. Mine is reading (and re-reading) 19th-century novels. It's hard to pick just a couple of favorites but I unreservedly adore Wilkie Collins (e.g., ""The Moonstone"") and Theodor Fontane (""Der Stechlin""). Which genres do you avoid? Historical fiction, especially of recent vintage. The brain simply cannot compartmentalize. I noticed while writing ""The Pity of War"" that I was subconsciously drawing on Pat Barker's ""The Ghost Road"" novels as if they were the real thing. Since then I've abstained completely. In any case, I would much rather read an authentic contemporary diary than a work of historical fiction. A good example is the diary of Ivan Maisky, the long-serving Soviet ambassador in London. Gabriel Gorodetsky's edition -- abridged and unabridged -- is a work for the ages. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night? I've tried electronic but I can't read on a screen for pleasure. It has to be the paper-and-ink book, preferably a robust paperback. From an early age, I've liked to have five books on the go at a time -- that was the maximum number one could borrow from the Ayr Public Library. As for when I read, always at night. In the morning, there are too many distractions.

What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I own books by a number of people who have insulted me in print, but I don't think it is all that surprising that I do research before taking vengeance. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I read a lot and quite systematically. Once I had identified an author I liked, I read everything by that person the library possessed. I vividly recall devouring the complete works of Arthur Conan Doyle and P. G. Wodehouse in this way. I have tried (and continue to try) as a father to impart my love of reading to my children, so the books I loved as a boy -- Tolkien's ""The Hobbit,"" for example, or Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" -- are books I have reread multiple times. The greatest works of literature benefit from being read aloud. A wonderful example are the ""Just William"" stories by Richmal Crompton, which deserve to be much better known in the United States. She was the Dorothy Parker of provincial England. If you could require the American president to read one book, what would it be? And the prime minister? I agree with you that it would be wonderful if both Mr. Trump and Mrs. May read one book. I don't much mind which one it is. You're organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson and John Buchan. I'd call it The Last Burns Supper. Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn't? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? The first book I ever abandoned was Captain Marryat's ""The Children of the New Forest,"" which came highly recommended but bored me rigid. I also struggled with ""Swallows and Amazons."" At the time, I felt quite guilty about these sins of omission. As I grew older, however, I became more cavalier and now treat books with the contempt they mostly deserve. To give an example of a book I found overrated, Thomas Piketty's ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century"" was both conceptually unsound and tediously executed."

With ""Repetiteur,"" the artist and architect Jorge Otero-Pailos preserves both the fingerprints and the spirit of Cunningham and his company in their rehearsal space.

The Pain and Sweat of Merce Cunningham Dancers, Captured in Latex

Evocative and easily overlooked, ""Repetiteur"" by Jorge Otero-Pailos, occupying an obscure rehearsal room at City Center, is on view this week only. Time is short. Time happens to be Mr. Otero-Pailos's subject. Back in 2010, Artangel, the London-based arts nonprofit, commissioned Mr. Otero-Pailos , the Spanish-born architect, artist and Columbia University professor of historic preservation, to collect dust from Westminster Hall, the oldest building at Britain's Parliament. A storied space with immense stone walls and a hammer-beam roof commissioned by Richard II, Westminster Hall is where the English established a court system, held Anne Boleyn's coronation banquet and tried Charles I for treason. Mr. Otero-Pailos's medium is natural liquid latex, a conservator's tool. At Westminster, he applied it to the hall's east wall, the latex acting like a sponge, absorbing dirt and other particles. Reinforced with fabric and peeled off in long sheets, it skinned, or cleaned, the wall, returning the stone to its original color.

The project preoccupied Mr. Otero-Pailos for several years. When he finished, he hung the casts from the hall's ceiling like two enormous tapestries -- honey-colored and translucent, glowing like amber in the light coming through Westminster's tall, arched windows. That exhibition, presented by Artangel, opened in 2016, just after the Brexit referendum passed, and not surprisingly it provoked some Britons to interpret the latex tapestries, with their odor and hints of flaying, as a metaphor for national martyrdom and decay.

Over the years, various artists like Eva Hesse and Rachel Whiteread have traversed similar terrain using latex casts. For Mr. Otero-Pailos, the goal is to capture architecture's ""intangible heritage,"" as he calls it. His works save not a building's walls, floors, windows or doors but remains of architectural habitation: whisperingly faint but still visceral remnants of actual bodies that occupied real space. Westminster belonged to a series of projects Mr. Otero-Pailos has undertaken called ""The Ethics of Dust,"" a phrase borrowed from the 19th-century critic John Ruskin. To Ruskin, great historical buildings spoke volumes. Restoration desecrated architecture by removing traces of the past. But properly conserved, a building retains evidence of the passage of time, layered like sediments of the earth.

""Repetiteur,"" at City Center, in effect does for Merce Cunningham and dance what ""The Ethics of Dust"" aimed to do at Westminster. Cunningham rehearsed his dancers in a particular studio at City Center whenever the company performed there. During rehearsals, the troupe would lean against the walls to rest, leaving fingerprints and sweat in the stucco and plaster. Not long ago, City Center decided to refurbish the room, whitewashing it and refinishing the old wainscoting, so beforehand Mr. Otero-Pailos arranged to make latex casts of the woodwork, vents, electrical outlets and so on. He produced six casts, currently displayed in four-foot-square light boxes on shin-high platforms or podiums, placed around the now-renovated studio according to the same grid system that Cunningham used to deploy his dancers, a system based on the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching.

What results is visually minimalist and low-key to a fault. But it's also kind of haunting. Doubled in number by the mirror that fills one long wall of the room, the light boxes have an accompanying soundtrack: audio clips that Mr. Otero-Pailos took from videos of Cunningham preparing his troupe to perform three works -- ""Exchange"" (which premiered at City Center in 1978), ""Roaratorio"" and ""CRWDSPCR.""

And so, like ""The Ethics of Dust,"" ""Repetiteur"" involves an act of historical conservation, which in this case meditates on the specific relationship between architecture and dance. Each dance rehearsal or performance, after all, takes place in a particular architectural space from which the dance is as inseparable as it is from its own choreography or dancers. Or as Mr. Otero-Pailos has put it, a film of a dance is no more an adequate record of the dance than a photograph of a demolished building can substitute for the actual building. In essence, ""Repetiteur"" restores what's missing from such a film -- conjuring up not just the architecture of the practice studio at City Center but also what you might call the architecture of time, study, repetition and pain that went into the making of Cunningham's art. We talk about preserving prized buildings and places. But architecture is more than bricks and mortar. It is the spaces we devise in which to live our lives, dream dreams, struggle and invent things. This is the larger point of Mr. Otero-Pailos's work, too, capturing vestiges of steps taken, leaps made. Through May 5 at New York City Center, Harkness Studio, 130 West 56th Street, nycitycenter.org. It is free and open to the public."
30523,"For Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, a Royal Wedding. For the Rest of Us: Royal Tours","With the couple's nuptials on the horizon, travel brands are offering themed hotel packages and viewing parties.","St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle outside London, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are to be married on May 19.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/18/travel/18getaway/merlin_133661745_1f4ef8b1-6a49-4386-8905-6608deaf09d5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=29a17672de89b8c4217a775be1876c81a31bee59ad28ccf7ea9fb972d820a31e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/travel/britain-royal-wedding-tours.html,e9aa5fc3-94e7-5361-8443-b90ed5c88fa3.jpg,"With the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle mere weeks away -- and the recent news that the couple will have a carriage procession around Windsor Town after their nuptials at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle -- hotels and tour companies are trotting out packages for royal watchers. In Britain it's easy to create your own royal-inspired itinerary with, say, a riverboat ride on the Thames and a visit to Windsor Castle (though note that the castle will be closed on May 18 and 19). From London to Windsor, there will be wedding-themed tea parties, and plenty of bars and pubs from which to watch the festivities (they are widely expected to be televised ) and celebrate into the night. In Windsor, the wedding day carriage procession route from St. George's Chapel will be via Castle Hill, along High Street and through Windsor Town, and then back to Windsor Castle along the Long Walk, according to the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead tourism site. You can preview the procession route in this video from the tourism association, Visit Windsor:

But for those who want to go a step further, there are royal wedding packages at hotels and, should you prefer to relish the big day with fellow fans, group tours. Among the most comprehensive is the eight-day Royal Wedding Celebration in England: Inside the British Monarchy tour from Road Scholar, the experiential learning travel company. The tour (from $2,499, excluding airfare) includes an indoor hotel-viewing party with picnic food as well as stops at the Tower of London, Kensington Palace, Westminster Abbey, Hampton Court Palace and Windsor Castle, as well as talks from former royal staff members about how to organize a security team of thousands of people, and the art of creating a royal cake.

The Original Tour, which has long offered open-top, hop-on hop-off bus tours of London, has begun, for the first time, operating daily bus tours of Windsor, just months before the royal wedding. The bus passes places such as Windsor Castle, Eton College (attended by both Prince William and Prince Harry) and the Royal Farms Windsor Farm Shop (a 24-hour period ticket is PS13, or about $18; PS7 for children; PS11 for students and adults over 60; PS33 for a family with two adults and two children; free for children under 5). There are a variety of day tours to be had in and around London. If you're considering signing up for one on May 19, be aware that in general, day tours that regularly visit Windsor Castle will not be visiting the castle that day. Companies like Evan Evans, for instance, which typically offers a day tour with stops at Windsor Castle, Stonehenge and Bath, will visit Hampton Court Palace, the former home of Henry VIII, on that day instead of Windsor Castle. The same is true for Golden Tours, which leads a Windsor Castle, Bath and Stonehenge tour but on the 19th will also visit Hampton Court Palace rather than Windsor Castle. Many leading Windsor hotels are already booked that day, though properties nearby and in London are selling royal-inspired getaways. You can even find a vacation rental promising the occasional wedding-themed amenity. ""If you are coming during the Royal wedding, there will be a complimentary Champagne hamper provided to help kick off the celebrations,"" read one Airbnb listing for a home in Windsor. At the Arch London boutique hotel, the Royal Wedding package, available throughout May, is PS3,900 for a two-night stay based on double occupancy and includes a two-bedroom suite; a three-course dinner at the hotel's restaurant, Hunter 486; a Champagne breakfast; and afternoon tea. The package includes a tour of Windsor Castle (not available on May 18 or 19) and a PS100 shopping voucher to Fortnum & Mason, the tea and gift shop. At One Aldwych in London, there will be a Royal Wedding Celebration Package on weekends in May, with rooms starting at PS355 a night. For an additional PS45, you can order a ""royal bouquet"" with peonies (reported to be a favorite flower of Ms. Markle, according to the hotel) and a sprig of myrtle (often used in royal brides' bouquets since the 1800s).

The Hotel Cafe Royal is offering a Regent Royal Wedding package from April 1 to June 21 (with a minimum stay of two nights), which includes accommodations in a suite; a limousine tour to Windsor Castle to visit the Chapel and The State Apartments; a picnic hamper for your day out; a royal wedding memorabilia gift; and an English breakfast, among other amenities (from PS2,000). Not posh enough? You can stay in the hotel's Empire suite with the Empire Royal Wedding package (with a minimum stay of three nights), which includes all of the above as well as additional amenities such as a helicopter tour of London and tickets to the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, from PS6,500 a night. While the wedding is to take place in Britain, that isn't stopping hotels in the United States from partaking in the festivities. Among them, the Drake, a Hilton Hotel in Chicago, is offering a ""Film and Fondue"" series Monday nights in May with movies such as ""The Queen,"" ""Elizabeth -- The Golden Age,"" and ""Victoria and Abdul"" (starting at $25 a person plus taxes and tips). There are royal-themed sweets, snacks, teas and bar specials (10 percent of the proceeds from beverages on the Royal Cocktail Menu in May will be donated to Prince Harry's endorsed charity, the Invictus Games Foundation). And, on the wedding day itself, the hotel is planning a screening of the royal festivities and, in the grand ballroom, a luncheon that was once served to Princess Diana during her visit to the hotel in 1996. ($100 for priority seating; $80 for general assigned seating; taxes and gratuities included. Reservations are required.)"

But there was a catch. ""You do,"" she said as her blue eyes twinkled mischievously, ""have to take it off awkwardly."" Ms. Johnson slipped her arms out of the sleeves, lowered the fabric to the floor and stepped out of it. ""It's really a dress,"" she said. Fittingly, Ms. Johnson's richly detailed dance-installations are full of surprises too. A Minneapolis artist originally from Alaska, Ms. Johnson returns to New York to present ""Niicugni,"" the second piece in a trilogy of works related to her Yupik heritage, at the Baryshnikov Arts Center beginning Wednesday. The presentation is part of Performance Space 122's Coil Festival. ""Niicugni,"" which means ""listen"" or, more specifically, ""to pay attention,"" is Ms. Johnson's follow-up to ""The Thank-you Bar,"" a Bessie award-winning work that focused on ideas of displacement, as well as stereotypes about American Indians through a ritualistic layering of dance, music and storytelling. Even though she's been choreographing since the mid 1990s, this work was the first in which she addressed her culture.

""I was just in physical pain missing Alaska,"" she said. "" 'The Thank-you Bar' came out of that time."" She had also begun working at Birchbark Books, an independent bookstore in Minneapolis owned by the author Louise Erdrich that specializes in American Indian writers. It was there that Ms. Johnson began to immerse herself in her heritage; it ""brought me home,"" she said. While Ms. Johnson, who still works at the bookstore, didn't set out to create a trilogy, it soon became apparent that ""The Thank-you Bar"" was just the beginning. Structurally Ms. Johnson sees her new ""Niicugni"" (nee-CHOOG-nee) as encompassing ""The Thank-you Bar."" Within an installation of 51 handmade fish-skin lanterns, created by Ms. Johnson and participants from workshops held in conjunction with residencies around the country, the work explores ideas about how a place, including a body, can tie everything and everyone together. It focuses on the wholeness of land, rather than its territorial borders.

""I know what it feels like to walk on the land I grew up on,"" she said. ""It's very spongy. The trees and the ground smell earthy and piney. I'm really interested in not forgetting that there's ground underneath this floor, and that we are all connected, via land, via ground, even in the sense that the ground is made of the remains of all creatures that have ever existed, including our ancestors.""

In ""Niicugni"" Ms. Johnson performs intricate duets with the dancer Aretha Aoki; some of the choreography is rooted in improvisations that required them to imagine they were dancing on earth. Part of the inspiration for the piece came from a picture of a mountain. ""You see a huge physical structure that seems so permanent and so still, but then you can see where there was maybe a rock slide,"" Ms. Johnson said. ""You can see the precariousness of it. The contradiction between presence and movement is a possibility at every moment."" There's also a political current running throughout the piece. One story she tells relates to land in a remote part of the state that her father was given through the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. ""It's so far away from where we live,"" she said. ""How do we build a relationship to this land? What does it mean to be given land that was taken away and comes back?"" Ms. Johnson is the anchor of this installation of movement, stories and song. As with ""The Thank-you Bar"" her presence, at first, seems gentle. Ms. Johnson's soft, clear voice makes her a seductive storyteller. Still, her words and, at times, disembodied delivery have bite. In ""Niicugni,"" a tale about how a monster bit off her ear, is a metaphor for how territory is dismantled throughout the world. ""My body has come from colonization,"" she explained. ""That holds a lot of monsters. I couldn't think about my connection to land and disregard that."" As with ""The Thank-you Bar"" the musicians -- the violinist Rachel Golub and the work's composer, James Everest -- perform movement sequences as they play. (Mr. Everest is also Ms. Johnson's husband.) And even though the proscenium arrangement of ""Niicugni"" presents challenges, Ms. Johnson is intent on creating a single space that blurs the separation between the performers and the audience. A canopy of lanterns stretches from the stage to the seats. Several contain speakers; the effect, Mr. Everest said, is like a pipe organ. ""Each speaker has its own sound, and we can move the sounds, meaning from the back of the space to front,"" he said. ""Or it can go in a circle. It has many parts, but they become a whole. They play as one."" Ms. Johnson has also enlisted a group of about 40 people who will sit in the audience but appear onstage from time to time to perform simple gestural movements. The result is a cycle of energy, in which audience members spill in and out of the piece. ""You start to look to the side and notice -- oh, we're all in this room together,"" Ms. Johnson said. ""Can we pay attention to the fact that we are all here, and we will all be gone? What is our presence, and what is our absence?""

Finding such participants has been a crucial part of ""Niicugni."" The lanterns were created at a residency at Vermont Performance Lab. ""I think it's very brave in the contemporary dance world to let all these others into your work,"" the lab director, Sara Coffey, said. ""You don't always have control of what that's going to be. I think Emily, as an artist, wants a place to rub off on her work as much as she wants to rub off on the place where she's performing."" As Ms. Johnson sees it, the lanterns carry stories. ""There is the story of the fish that migrated for thousands of miles, the fish that fed people,"" she said. ""There is all the energy put into the object, and then the relationships and conversations that developed during the workshops. That process is the dance itself. It is as important as what is onstage. If you're sitting in an audience, you might not get that whole story, but that story is there."""
23574,"One in 10 Older Adults Binge Drinks, Study Says","A new study looked at the prevalence of heavy drinking among adults 65 and older, who are especially vulnerable to its effects.","Excessive alcohol use by older adults is a risk factor for a range of health problems, including injury, a study's authors said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/01/health/01xp-alcohol/01xp-alcohol-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5f0735b6166888baada6878da93d1006a84f62280432bd9054a5d2e2f565e488&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/health/binge-drinkers-adult-alcohol.html,d7c8b7de-fe77-5c90-9a55-4eed1ee39f86.jpg,"Excessive alcohol consumption is not safe for a person at any age, but it is particularly dangerous for older adults. And according to a study published this week, about one in 10 older adults is considered a binge drinker. ""Binge drinking, even episodically or infrequently, may negatively affect other health conditions by exacerbating disease, interacting with prescribed medications and complicating disease management,"" said Dr. Benjamin Han, the lead author of the study that was published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Alcohol is also a risk factor for injury, Dr. Han said, but the consequences and recovery from a fall are much more serious for an 81-year-old than a 21-year-old.

The study defined binge drinking as consuming five or more drinks in a sitting for men, and four or more drinks in a sitting for women. And a drink equaled a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine or a wine cooler, a shot of liquor, or a mixed drink with liquor in it. Dr. Han's group analyzed data from the annual U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health between 2015 and 2017. In all, the findings included 10,927 adults aged 65 or older who reported their drinking habits in the previous 30 days. The group did not include adults living in long-term-care facilities or nursing homes, Dr. Han added. The prevalence of binge drinking among adults 65 and older is still relatively low compared with other age groups, Dr. Han said. Over 38 percent of college-aged adults, 18 to 25, had recently drunk excessively, the highest prevalence of any age group. Adults ages 26 to 34 had only slightly fewer binge drinkers, and the second highest percentage, the study found. While the drinking habits of teenagers and younger people has been a focus for clinicians and researchers, more attention should be paid to older adults, Dr. Han said .

Timothy S. Naimi, an alcohol epidemiologist and professor at Boston University's Schools of Medicine and Public Health, said the one in 10 figure ""is an impressive number and it's concerning."" The number is ""undoubtedly an underestimate,"" he added, because people tend to miscalculate how much they actually drink and heavy drinkers are less likely to be available or to be included in surveys for other reasons. Dr. Han said he hoped the study would emphasize the importance for clinicians to screen older patients for alcohol use and to educate them about how their bodies become more sensitive to alcohol as they age. The study did not examine the causes of excessive drinking or whether this number represents an increase or a decrease from previous years. However, Joseph J. Palamar, an associate professor at New York University School of Medicine and an author of the study, pointed to the cohort itself as a factor. ""I believe that this is driven in part by the baby boomers aging,"" Dr. Palamar said, about a group that was more likely to experiment with drugs and alcohol than the generation before it. Dr. George F. Koob, the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, one of the organizations that funded the study, said the findings confirmed trends they have been monitoring. In 2017, epidemiologists at the institute published a study using data from 2001-2 and 2012-13 that showed that problem drinking was rising among older Americans."

It's a shame, then, that the film doesn't match its subjects in energy, imagination or perspective.

Initially, when the film begins with remembrances from the tragedy, it seems that it will take a broad overview of the event and its consequences. In those first few minutes, the director, Cheryl Horner McDonough, uses group interviews, newscasts and videos of the attack taken from inside the school as well as calls to the police. But as the path out of bloodshed becomes clear, the movie narrows its focus and primarily follows students, particularly David Hogg, as he navigates media attention, and a defiant father, Manuel Oliver, who makes art in remembrance of his slain son, Joaquin."

But they run some risks.","In December, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. introduced Hazy Little Thing I.P.A. in a few areas, and has released it nationwide this month.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/24/dining/24IPA1/24IPA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=117abf6dc6bdb42ece5a52b33967ca9c1e401893cbc3b6dc5455211a5af191b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/dining/drinks/beer-ipa-sam-adams-sierra-nevada.html,91b1c012-c1d6-5727-ad6b-607c024c6afd.jpg,"The New England-style India pale ale, with its juicy hop flavors and hazy look, has become a phenomenon among craft beer fans. They camp out overnight to be among the first to buy rare releases, and flock to hazy-I.P.A. festivals in New York City, Buffalo, Toronto and Portland, Ore., to celebrate the new vanguard. Now comes proof that the groundswell is more than just a passing tremor: Two of the country's largest craft brewers are making their own versions of the style. In December, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. introduced Hazy Little Thing I.P.A. in a few areas, and this month has released it nationwide. The Boston Beer Company, which makes Samuel Adams, has begun selling its New England I.P.A. in that region, and will go nationwide in February. For these companies, the move is both a logical next step and a big risk. Much of the appeal of the hazy I.P.A.s stems from their origins as small-batch, indie brews that are sold at the source. And unlike any earlier styles, these beers require freshness in the extreme. After a few weeks, they literally fall apart -- the haze disappears as their proteins fall out of suspension, destroying the hop flavors and, in most cases, rendering the beer fit for the drain. ""Hazy I.P.A.s are pretty tough to make if you're hoping to distribute nationally,"" said Bill Manley, who helped develop Sierra Nevada's recipe for Hazy Little Thing before leaving the company in November. ""The haze that's in beer is, by and large, pretty darn unstable.""

But the big brewers think they can guarantee freshness, win over the skeptics and appeal to parts of the country that this young style hasn't reached. ""There are still many drinkers who have yet to experience the hazy, citrusy brew,"" said Meaghan Quinn, a spokeswoman for Samuel Adams. The fervor around these beers is ripe with hyperbole, but in the best examples, it's warranted. Hazy I.P.A.s offer lush, juicy flavors that beers have never had before. Brewers are harnessing the citrus and tropical notes of new hop varieties while eschewing their characteristic bitterness, a trick they achieve by loading their hops late in the brewing process, and in huge quantities. These beers seem to defy large-scale production and cross-country shipping; many brewers intentionally keep batches small to ensure freshness through high turnover. But Sierra Nevada in particular has consistently made world-class beers in big volume, and these ephemeral I.P.A.s will be its biggest test. The beers' haze has traditionally come from hop particles that mix with yeast in suspension. The result is hop flavors that, rather than wafting up to your nose from the glass, burst in your mouth after each sip.

As the New England style has proliferated, breweries have turned to high-protein grains, like oats and unmalted wheat, to build a more stable haze for their beloved hops to nest in. Others use additives like pectin or even flour, igniting debate in the most fervent corners of the craft-beer world. Sierra Nevada uses oats in its recipe for Hazy Little Thing. But it also employs other tricks for quality control, including one common among wheat beer producers: When sending kegs to restaurants and bars, the company instructs distributors to ship them upside down. That way, the bartender is forced to flip them upon delivery, stirring up the proteins and restoring the haze. Today, an I.P.A.'s cloudy appearance has become its signifier, even a status symbol, flooding Instagram feeds and inspiring hashtags like #hazyipa and #newenglendipa. Garrett Oliver, the brewmaster of Brooklyn Brewery, has declared the New England ales ""the first beer style based around Instagram culture and based around social media."" But in the beginning, haze wasn't the goal; it was a side effect. ""We never set out to brew an I.P.A. that was hazy,"" said John Kimmich, a founder and the head brewer of the Alchemist in Waterbury, Vt. ""Our I.P.A. was hazy because we brewed it the way I wanted it to taste."" Mr. Kimmich is the creator of Heady Topper, the ale that popularized the style and still sells out hours after a shipment hits New York City. His beer brims with flavors of tropical fruit and pine, balanced with a keen, citrus-peel bitterness. When he began brewing Heady Topper in 2004, his goal was to load up on hop flavors using ""dry hopping,"" or adding hops during fermentation rather than during the boiling process. This coaxes more aroma than bitter flavor from the hops; the sheer volume of hops happened to turn the beer hazy.

Some might question the need to sell a beer this perishable nationwide. Fresh, locally made beer is readily available these days in most metropolitan areas. But the hazy-I.P.A. trend hasn't swept the middle of the nation yet, and Samuel Adams hopes to bring some people their first taste of the style. The company is keeping an eye on distributors to ensure that consumers get their beer fresh. ""No beer is ever going to be as good as it is five days out of the brewery,"" said Megan Parisi, the head brewer at the Boston nanobrewery where Samuel Adams researches and develops new recipes. But the company is banking on the beer's staying good for a while; it is setting an expiration date of three months for its New England I.P.A. Mr. Kimmich is most excited about the new beer from Sierra Nevada, a company he idolized early in his career, as a brewer in the 1990s at the Vermont Pub and Brewery. ""Sierra Nevada? Those guys,"" he said. ""How many countless beers have they inspired with their pale ale?"" How the New Brews Taste New England-style I.P.A.s walk a spectrum from bitter to sweet. This is a case where balance isn't always preferred: If you already love I.P.A.s, there are many bitter ones to satisfy you. If you don't, the sweet variety could be your gateway drink. Now that two of the nation's largest craft brewers have entered the scene, with Sierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing (6.7 percent alcohol by volume) and Samuel Adams New England I.P.A. (6.8 percent A.B.V.), how do they fit into that spectrum?

In terms of flavor, both are a tier below their small-batch counterparts, missing the vibrant fruitiness that distinguishes the best of breed. Samuel Adams's beer evokes citrus but not in the literal, tastes-like-juice way that is the New England style; it's scarcely different from an ordinary I.P.A. The Sierra Nevada beer has more pleasant flavors of dried apricot and dried pineapple, and is the better choice if you can't find something fresh and local. But in many parts of the country, local examples will be more expressive and worth seeking out. In New York, Other Half Brewing is the king of hazy I.P.A.s, so much so that its cans are nearly impossible to find. But they are worth the hunt -- lean, racy and sharp with hops. Greenpoint Beer & Ale's Instant Credibility (7.8 percent A.B.V.) punches with aggressive bitterness and an undercurrent of pulpy orange and mango nectar. Also lovely is its spiritual opposite from upstate, Industrial Arts Wrench (6.8 percent A.B.V.), which embodies the sweet end of the spectrum with a silky mouth feel and flavors that verge on pineapple juice. I.P.A. skeptics, start here. As the originator of the New England style, the Alchemist's Heady Topper (8 percent A.B.V.) has one foot in the traditional I.P.A. style, with familiar notes of pine, grapefruit and resin turned up in the foreground, washing over a background of fruit-driven hops. Mr. Kimmich, Alchemist's brewer, calls it ""balanced,"" and hopheads will attest to that. It won't bring new fans to hoppy beers, but it's a treat for the already converted.

Jordan, who has asthma and has battled multiple cases of pneumonia in his 12-year career, announced on Twitter that he would not participate in the N.B.A. restart, which is scheduled to begin soon at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Fla.

Dinwiddie, who averaged 20.6 points and 6.8 assists per game in what had been a breakout season, followed up Jordan's tweet with one of his own, saying he still hoped to play in Florida but adding that ""unfortunately I have been one of the cases that has various symptoms.""

A Nets spokesman said Tuesday morning that the team's practice facility had been re-opened after a brief closure, but it is unclear which teammates and team staff members Jordan and Dinwiddie had worked with -- or if the club was reconsidering its plans to participate in the N.B.A.'s 22-team return because of the lost manpower. General Manager Sean Marks and the Nets' interim coach, Jacque Vaughn, are scheduled to speak to reporters Wednesday."
54268,An Open House Disguised as a Dinner Party,"A series of dinner parties are intended to bring together creative professionals not just for networking, but to show off new high-end property.","A penthouse on the market at Stella Tower in Hell's Kitchen was the setting for a lavish dinner party, where guests were served a four-course tasting menu.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/27/realestate/27OPENCOV/27OPENCOV-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=2dd7122653e29095149953de24fb48fc7e1fbc1ac3a94c01ead45e0643f772fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/realestate/an-open-house-disguised-as-a-dinner-party.html,d813d7e5-e67b-59d3-926e-5dc2adb8d614.jpg,"It might have been any over-the-top Manhattan dinner party: a penthouse setting where several dozen carefully chosen, accomplished guests enjoyed artisanal cocktails, a four-course tasting menu prepared by up-and-coming chefs and a live dance performance. But this was no ordinary over-the-top party. It was an open house -- albeit a very exclusive one. Organized by Jessica Wolf, a recent Dartmouth graduate who is the membership manager at NeueHouse, the private club and co-working space, the late-June event was one of a series of dinners intended to bring together creative professionals not just for networking, but also to show off a new high-end property nearing completion. The thinking, said Ms. Wolf, 23, is that the best kind of publicity for luxury real estate is word of mouth (or social media posts) by the right people. Her company, Vivonne, is a members-only supper club that partners with brokerages like Douglas Elliman Real Estate to arrange these events, four of which have been held since April.

""For years, we've done the typical broker preview and one launch party,"" said Vickey Barron, one of the Douglas Elliman brokers handling the condominiums at Stella Tower in Hell's Kitchen, the 1927 Art Deco building where the event took place. But it made sense, she said, to try something less conventional for such a high-end property.

The Vivonne guests could wander the 4,000 or so square feet of the $13.5 million penthouse, with its four bedrooms, two levels and huge outdoor terrace. And many in the crowd ducked out to look at the penthouse next door, which also happened to be for sale. ""I love the opportunity to get into any New York real estate that's unique,"" said Temple Simpson, an architect who was one of the guests. (Other guests included DJs, photographers, restaurateurs and entrepreneurs.) Ben Shaoul, the principal at the Magnum Real Estate Group, is taking the same approach to selling the luxury condominiums his firm is developing with the CIM Group at 100 Barclay in TriBeCa, in what was formerly the Verizon building. (The condominiums, which will range in price from about $2.5 million for a two-bedroom to $15 million for a five-bedroom, will occupy the top 22 floors, while Verizon will continue to use the bottom 10 floors.)

The building's lobby, a landmark Art Deco space decorated with frescoes depicting the history of communication, from smoke signals to the early telephone, was off-limits to the public when Verizon was the sole occupant. But not anymore. ""We invested a lot of time and energy to make it a beautiful space,"" said Mr. Shaoul, who held a Vivonne event in one of the apartments in late April and allowed Soho Synagogue, another group that holds networking parties, to use the lobby for a black-tie event in June. (Those who needed to use the restroom were directed to a fully staged apartment on the 19th floor.) Mr. Shaoul's hope, he explained, is that ""people go home and say, 'I went to this great event last night, and the building is gorgeous.' They'll log onto the Internet and maybe they'll be interested."" Michael Graves, another Douglas Elliman broker, was thinking along the same lines when he offered a penthouse he had listed for $6.95 million at 236 West 24th Street as a location for a party in June called ""Lose My Mind."" The event, which was also a fund-raiser for the Suffolk County Vanderbilt Museum on Long Island, included an exhibition of photographs by Patrick McMullan and a musical performance by Consuelo Vanderbilt Costin.

The best sales strategy, she added, is one that doesn't seem like a sales strategy at all. ""In my opinion, you don't sell,"" she said. ""Like that dinner: You're there to enjoy an experience in a place that just happens to be for sale. You can offer, educate and answer questions, but no one is going to make you buy an apartment."" Whether that actually works, of course, has yet to be seen. And nearly three months later, both penthouses have yet to be sold."

Everyone welcomed her at her parents' place after church on Sundays, at birthday parties for nieces and nephews. Then in October, that door snapped shut again: A preview for the documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly"" had dropped, and Sparkle was in it, telling the world what she thought Robert Kelly had done to her niece. One of her sisters texted her to say that she heard Sparkle was on ""some TV show about rob"" talking about the family. She told Sparkle to leave them alone. Sparkle, a singer, was once R. Kelly's protegee. He produced her first album in the late 1990s, which went gold. But in 2002, he was arrested on child pornography charges stemming from a video that shows a man having sex with and urinating on a teenager. Sparkle testified at trial in 2008 that the man in the video was Mr. Kelly, and that the girl was her 14-year-old niece.

Her testimony sliced her family into factions, relegating her to years of exile, and it may have stifled her career. Today, Sparkle is arguably more well known for her public stand against him than she is for her music. And as Mr. Kelly faces new charges of sexual abuse, prosecutors have told her she may be called to testify again. ""I hope they don't need me,"" she said. ""But I have to. I have to see this thing through."" [Read more about the latest charges against R. Kelly.] Sparkle, whose real name is Stephanie Edwards, was born on the West Side of Chicago, the youngest of six children. (She described her current age as ""somewhere between birth and death."") The family moved to the suburb of Oak Park when Sparkle was 3, and she started singing in church a year later. Encouraged by her father, she and her siblings formed a gospel group growing up. ""I don't know if I ever dreamed of being a professional singer, because I wanted to be a model,"" she said with a laugh. ""But dear old dad, he was like, 'No, you get up there and you sing, and you'd better be the loudest!'"" She met Mr. Kelly in 1989 and a few years later, she said, she was singing backup on an album he was producing: ""Age Ain't Nothing but a Number,"" by the singer Aaliyah. The album title would soon take on a sinister cast: The year the record was released, a 27-year-old Mr. Kelly reportedly married Aaliyah, who was 15. The marriage was annulled. (Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001.) Mr. Kelly's lawyer declined to comment for this article. Sparkle said that at the time, she thought talk of the marriage was a publicity stunt. How could anything like that happen when Aaliyah's parents and her uncle, who was Mr. Kelly's manager, were always around? Still, she continued working with him.

Then, in 1996, Mr. Kelly changed Sparkle's life. She was at a big retirement party for her father when Mr. Kelly called and asked her to come down to his studio in the River West neighborhood of Chicago. Down she went in a long black gown and heels, and when she arrived, she started recording what would become her own debut album, ""Sparkle."" She spent time recording at night and went to work during the day at SportsChannel Chicago as an assistant engineer. Sparkle's album, released in 1998, was a success, selling half a million copies. But even before its release, her professional relationship with Mr. Kelly was so strained that he had threatened not to release it at all, she said. By the time they started working on her second album, it was untenable.

""He was trying to now be really controlling, and I saw it now,"" she said. ""You're not going to do that with me."" Sparkle said that she asked to be released from her contract, and he let her go. She put out her second album, ""Told You So,"" with Motown records in 2000, but it was far less successful. Sparkle is still a singer, though she has never repeated the success she saw 20 years ago. She sang backup for Toni Braxton for a few years. She released a single in 2012 called ""So Bad."" She said that private performances have helped her make a living. And just before the documentary about Mr. Kelly came out in January, she released a new song called ""We Are Ready,"" which explores the themes of the #MeToo movement. It is impossible to know what effect her schism with Mr. Kelly had on her career, but in a business grounded in relationships, alienating such a powerful figure certainly could have created roadblocks.

Today, she lives in downtown Chicago with Bruce Wayne, her manager and boyfriend of nearly 20 years. ""I'm fighting to have a street named after her,"" Mr. Wayne said. ""She held a mirror up to society. This is bigger than R. Kelly, and she's been so far ahead of everybody."" With long blond hair and an elegant bearing, Sparkle carries herself like a woman who knows how to have her picture taken, and how to stand her ground. But there is a warmth behind the glamorous presentation. Good friends call her Steph, but Mr. Wayne has a lot of people calling her Miss Jenkins. That nickname comes from a skit on the TV show ""In Living Color,"" in which a gossipy character named Benita Butrell would dish into the camera and then proclaim, ""but I ain't one to gossip, so you ain't hear that from me."" The character was known for freaking out and saying ""Don't nobody better say nothing bad about Miss Jenkins!"" before trashing Miss Jenkins. Sparkle, he said, hates keeping secrets, even of the most uncomfortable truths. She believes that if someone has done wrong, she is obligated to tell. ""Growing up, she was the one who always blew the whistle and told,"" Mr. Wayne said. ""This is, I guess, her call of duty.""

Before she and Mr. Kelly went their separate ways, Sparkle made a decision that would fundamentally alter her family: She introduced Mr. Kelly to her brother-in-law, a guitar player, and to her niece. The girl was an aspiring rapper, charismatic and talented, and Sparkle said she hoped Mr. Kelly could do for her niece what he was doing for her. (Her niece is now in her mid-30s, but Sparkle still refuses to say her name during interviews, which she describes as an effort to protect her.) In 2001, a lawyer who said he wanted to represent her sister contacted Sparkle to say he had a tape of her niece having sex with Mr. Kelly. Sparkle decided to testify against Mr. Kelly, along with about a dozen other witnesses who identified Mr. Kelly and her niece in court. But her sister insisted that the girl in the video was not her child. The family split. Only one of Sparkle's brothers -- Bennie Edwards, who used to braid her hair and make her breakfast every morning as a child -- stood by her. ""Sparkle, she loves her family, they need to know that,"" Mr. Edwards said. ""I love them as well, but the truth -- the truth is the truth at the end of the day, and that's all it is.""

Mr. Kelly was acquitted on all charges in 2008. Sparkle's niece never testified, and his lawyers argued successfully that the identities of the people in the video could not be known for certain. Now, prosecutors in Chicago say that another tape has surfaced showing Mr. Kelly having sex with the same girl. Mr. Kelly was arrested in February on charges involving four alleged victims, and while any trial could still be years away, the tape is a crucial piece of evidence in what may be the strongest case against him. Sparkle said she has seen stills of the video and that it's clearly a different recording of the same people. Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer who gave the tape to prosecutors, said the people on the tape talk about the girl's 14-year-old body parts.

But Mr. Avenatti is now facing legal troubles of his own, with federal prosecutors accusing him of stealing money from clients and lying about his income to the I.R.S. and in bankruptcy court. Mr. Avenatti has denied all the allegations against him and suggested that the case was politically motivated. (He has represented Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against President Trump.) ""Any charges I am facing have nothing to do with the R. Kelly case and will have zero impact,"" Mr. Avenatti said. ""Greenberg is desperate,"" he added, referring to Mr. Kelly's lawyer, Steven Greenberg. Mr. Greenberg has asked the judge for all electronic communications between Mr. Avenatti and the prosecutors. Mr. Greenberg suggested in a filing that the Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly M. Foxx may have been ""manipulated"" by Mr. Avenatti. Friction between members of the Edwards family began to fade once Mr. Kelly's trial was over, and in 2011, while planning their parents' 50th wedding anniversary, the siblings started speaking again. But inside their new calm, nothing related to Mr. Kelly was discussed, even as her brother-in-law continued to play guitar with him professionally. When Sparkle tried to speak with her sister about what happened, her sister would only say, ""God forgives."" In recent years, as Sparkle watched the #MeToo movement shake the country, she did not expect it to come for Mr. Kelly. ""I didn't think it was for us,"" she said, ""for black people."" Then the filmmaker Dream Hampton reached out to Sparkle to ask if she would participate in a documentary about Mr. Kelly that would chronicle his alleged history of abusing girls and women. Sparkle said she agreed to participate when it was made clear to her that her story would be in the documentary, whether she was or not. She said she didn't want someone else to get it wrong.

But Sparkle did not tell the family the documentary was coming. Her mother had dementia and her health was failing. ""I didn't want this to be my mom's end,"" she said. In the fall, just days after her mother died, the trailer for ""Surviving R. Kelly"" was released, and Sparkle was in it. Her sister texted her and told her to leave them alone. Bennie Edwards and their brother, Lee, are the only two of her five siblings who are speaking with her now. She has been criticized for trying to capitalize on the film with her new single, ""We Are Ready,"" she said, but she is a singer, and this is how she processes her life. She plans to release an EP, ""Obstacle Course,"" her first in nearly 20 years, this summer. ""You know, I was thinking back to a time, before was a MeToo,"" she says on her new single, ""it was just me."""

A Memoir of Ambition and Manhood in America 

By  

253 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. As far as air traffic goes, the skies aren't amiable -- they're at best benign, and are rendered so by watchful humans in towers. Greg Pardlo Sr. was once one such guardian, until President Ronald Reagan fired him and nearly 13,000 others for participating in the air traffic controllers' strike of 1981. His son  was 13 at the time, and takes up the subject in his dynamic new memoir, ""Air Traffic: A Memoir of Ambition and Manhood in America."" Pardlo, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, writes, ""It appeared to me then, and I know it to be true now, that the air traffic control strike was the defining moment in my father's life. A pivotal point for me by proxy; the strike still shapes how I understand all that happened before and after it in my life."" Pardlo, who admits to omitting the ""Jr."" from his public persona ""with what might be construed as a sort of patricidal malice,"" divides his exploration into two parts. The first is largely a traditional memoir. In prose at once lucid, lyrical and rich in simile, Pardlo historicizes his grandfathers' migration to the East Coast, his family's middle-class life in suburban New Jersey, episodes of adolescent strife and his hasty enlistment in the Marine Corps Reserve.

In one memorable passage, Pardlo describes his father, then a member of his high school's Black Student Union, bum-rushing a school board meeting and delivering a speech that enchanted a room of wary adults. The reception to his address ignited in the elder Pardlo the belief that he was special -- and that little work was required to reap the yield of his gifts. (The tacit manifesto of the entire Pardlo clan, a telos that exacted high costs, seems to have been proving their ""exceptionalism."") During his militant teenage years, Greg Pardlo Sr. wooed and married an artistic young woman; the couple had two sons. Pardlo, the first-born, was the braniac brother, and remembers his father forcing him to define words in the dictionary ""until I could prove to my father's satisfaction that I understood every word in the definition clearly."" He describes the reprimands as an ""ordeal,"" but they also appear to have reinforced his innate talent for language. When Pardlo won the Pulitzer in 2015 for his collection ""Digest,"" the citation praised his ""clear-voiced poems that bring readers the news from 21st-century America, rich with thought, ideas and histories public and private."" Replace the word ""poems"" with the word ""essays,"" and you have an apt description of the second part of ""Air Traffic."" The book shifts midway to a collection of short essays that show an enviable talent for aphorism. Pardlo examines the existential quality of mutual orgasms, his marriages, the role of time in the lives of African-Americans and his experiences raising two daughters.

The topic of race is never far, though Pardlo appears conflicted. He asserts he isn't a ""practicing black,"" but also says: ""I don't want to be considered American to the exclusion of my African-Americanness. I don't want to be considered post-black or ex-colored."" Those statements beg deeper explication. And there are other moments that would have benefited from a more sustained investigation. For example, he reveals he wants to ""reinvent America ... forgive us our history of slavery, and the crackpot invention of race."" Later, he mentions a diagnosis of bipolar disorder but doesn't expound on the role it may have played in his personal trials. The lack of reflection and omissions often seem calculated, as if Pardlo plans to revisit these subjects in future work. One hopes too that he'll come to terms with the emotional legacy of a proud and overbearing father who could never find it in himself to offer his son unconditional praise. When Pardlo won the Pulitzer, his father texted him, ""When a Roman general conquered a town, Cesar [sic] would send a slave to ride alongside the general in the victory parade, and remind the general that he was only human."" Pardlo is perhaps most vulnerable and incisive on the topic of addiction. He acknowledges his grandparents' struggle with alcoholism, reflects on his father's and brother's fights with substance abuse and his own decades-long battle. To save Pardlo's brother, Robbie, the family once appeared on the docudrama ""Intervention."" At the time of the taping, Pardlo was drinking himself to blackout. The intervention didn't work on his brother, but did inspire Pardlo's sobriety. ""Because it is eternal,"" he writes, ""alcoholism is the closest thing I have to religion."" A runner-up might be literature, or, in a broader sense, art. ""Somewhere in the rusty catacombs of my mind lies the belief that great art requires great sacrifice, and a hope that there are artists presently on earth capable of making such sacrifices,"" he writes. His father died in 2016, and never read the most recent art Pardlo made about their lives. Had he lived long enough to read ""Air Traffic,"" one hopes he could have seen past his hubris and their strained relations to offer what might be Pardlo's most coveted review: Well done, son. You did good."
6938,It's the Year 2120. MasterClass Is the Only School Left.,People love success. But can they learn it?,Anna Wintour teaches creativity and leadership and possibly depth of field.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/28/fashion/22MASTERCLASS3/22MASTERCLASS3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c13cbacb6f5cad8e4f730c517dd4838c0ff2d855d5e5e3fc0bcb1a413905964a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/style/masterclass-secrets.html,056d0ddc-44f5-5aac-bdd8-b6d594b1bc05.jpg,"In mid-March, as much of the world withdrew into their homes, the celebrity-powered e-learning platform MasterClass began to notice that people who encountered its advertisements were often watching them in full. This was a testament to the efficacy of what the company calls its ""trailers"" -- glossy spots, set against the rise and fall of an orchestral score, that function as not only an expression of its thesis that ""online education can be beautiful and cinematic,"" as Aaron Rasmussen, a co-founder, explained, but also as reintroductions to illustrious known quantities. ""For someone to watch your film for more than just a few seconds is a big victory,"" said David Schriber, the company's chief marketing officer. Of course, seductive advertising is a kind of science. ""There really is a format to it,"" said Mr. Rasmussen, ""with a joke and a buildup, a sensitive moment that's sometimes painful, then the contrast to the rising end of the trailer that brings us into, 'I'm so-and-so, and this is my MasterClass.""

Founded in 2015, MasterClass lays claim to Bob Iger, Anna Wintour, RuPaul and Serena Williams, plus another 80 or so other titans of art and industry, all of whom impart wisdom and know-how from their respective fields in lectures that run about the length of a film by Martin Scorsese, who, as you might have guessed, teaches a MasterClass, too. The idea is to accord virtual education the same sheen of prestige that HBO bestowed upon the three-camera sitcom and that TED Talks brought to the airport book. With a somewhat-captive audience now spending twice as many minutes each month on the platform; a promotional campaign called ""Today's the Day""; and another $100 million in private investment announced last week, MasterClass has seized its moment. You Can Take It With You In combining the production value (and cost) of streaming television, the lure of celebrity and the silver-tongued spirit of self-improvement, MasterClass is oriented toward teaching certain abstract concepts -- ""creativity,"" ""self-expression,"" ""entrepreneurship"" -- even as some courses address more empirical pursuits like poker or the fundamentals of French pastries.

Mr. Schriber described the aforementioned consumer as a ""30-something who aspires to do something more, who is sensitive to the fact that they have a career, they're not in structured education anymore and they might even be feeling insecure that their peers know a little bit more about certain subjects."" When he left his post as Nike's Vice President of Global Brand Experience to join the MasterClass team last summer, he saw a company that had perfected the art of social media marketing but whose variegated portfolio of instructors ""made us 50 different brands."" As a result, he sought to streamline the process of teacher recruitment, which had been geared more toward star power than student. The people, he found, wanted classes about personal finance and negotiation. This led MasterClass to a ""somewhat unlikely instructor,"" he said: The former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss, whose course has been one of the most-watched this year. A company spokesperson said Mr. Voss's class was the most common destination for users who've completed Bobbi Brown's course on makeup and beauty, while those who start with Steph Curry's lesson in basketball most often elect to watch Gordon Ramsay next.

Now, MasterClass rejects nine out of 10 people who pitch themselves as potential instructors. The reason, Mr. Schriber said, ""is that they're not a practitioner."" MasterClass declined to share how its instructors are compensated, though reports say they receive a base pay up front and a revenue share of subscriptions sold to their classes. ""For every single one of our instructors,"" Mr. Rogier said, the decision to teach a MasterClass ""comes from a place of wanting to help people. You're never going to earn as much money with us. You're going to earn tons more if you just do an endorsement deal."" MasterClass is aiming for post-pandemic posterity. ""We're trying to think about our classes being something that's here for all time,"" Mr. Schriber said.

""It's funny, people kept coming in, and you know, we're having to hire a ton of people, et cetera. And they would be like, 'What's your four-year plan?' And I would say, 'Well, I'll tell you what our hundred-year plan is. And we'll wind it back 96 years and we'll get to the first four years, but the hundred year plan is, 100 years from now, there should be a group of people capturing the knowledge of the world's greatest -- crystallizing it, and disseminating it, that's my goal. But also, 100 years from now, the things we make today should hold up. They should be worthy of that. So when people look back in time and say, you know, who is the greatest singer of that era? Christina Aguilera's name is going to come up. I'm huge into music, and I've never seen anything like that in person. She's just absolutely unbelievable. Well, what's amazing is, it'll say: And she tried to pass on her knowledge and here's where you can see it,"" Mr. Rasmussen said. A class on the subject of ""leadership"" by the Pulitzer-winning presidential biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin benefits from some degree of critical distance, where courses on the same topic by Disney chairman Bob Iger or Conde Nast artistic director and Vogue editor Anna Wintour appeal more to a kind of in-the-room-where-it-happens voyeurism, such as Mr. Iger recounting the moment he pitched Steve Jobs on Disney acquiring Pixar, or when Ms. Wintour reveals, rather suspiciously, that she doesn't notice the outfits of job applicants she interviews. Are you learning? Or are you having fun? It's a binary Mr. Rogier rejects altogether. ""I think there's this myth and we got it, especially in the beginning, when we began this, people ask me, are you education, or are you entertainment?"" he recalled. ""I think that's a false choice. Why can't education also be entertaining?"" Incidentally, the Other Classes Are Also Booming Even Without Masters If other e-learning start-ups have positioned themselves as alternatives to in-person schooling, MasterClass sits neatly at the intersection of pedagogy and entertainment, leveraging its celebrity roll call and minimalist design to foster a sense of amity between users and their instructors. Salman Khan, the founder of Khan Academy, the 12-year-old education nonprofit, also noticed an uptick in traffic this year. But he distinguishes the MasterClass audience from his own. ""That's going to solve your upper-middle class or affluent"" consumer, he said. ""Our charter is very different. We want to create the best learning materials that you can make accessible to the entire planet."" ""There are lots and lots of players in this space who take various approaches,"" said Darren Shimkus, the president of Udemy for Business, an e-learning start-up which boasts over 150,000 prerecorded courses taught by some 57,000 voluntary instructors. Like Khan Academy, whose teacher and student registrations are ""five to 10 times"" greater than normal, Udemy is experiencing a new groundswell of activity in the early part of this year.

""It's almost like the next 10 years of change and growth is being compressed into about a month,"" said Mr. Shimkus. ""Change we would have expected by 2030 we're actually seeing now, in April 2020."" Who Will Watch the Masters Give Classes? ""It's almost like you're sitting in your living room having a conversation with these people, or more of a one-way conversation,"" said Patrick Mahan, 41, who owns an advertising agency in Lexington, Ky., and first encountered MasterClass when looking for a Christmas gift last year for his father. Then came the targeted advertisements on Facebook and Twitter, which drove Mr. Mahan to purchase his own subscription. ""The last few years I've always been like, man, I would love to do this, I just wish we had more time. Sometimes you've got to be careful what you wish for, I guess."" Now, more than two months into quarantine, Mr. Mahan finds himself binge-watching Masterclasses ""like Netflix,"" owing at least in part to the blink-and-you-miss-it intervals between lessons the program appears to have borrowed from the streaming heavyweight. Kanesha Baynard, who runs an educational consulting business, was similarly impressed by the platform's ability to exploit the conventions of recreational viewing. Ms. Baynard first encountered a MasterClass ad for the prolific showrunner Shonda Rhimes on TV writing. Sheltered with her family in Los Altos, Calif., the program has become a source of both reprieve and enrichment. ""If I'm cooking dinner, I can put it on, because no one wants to come into the kitchen when I'm cooking because they don't want to help,"" she said. ""Which is great, because then I can watch MasterClass.""

Can We Learn It All? The MasterClass approach is not without its skeptics, who wonder if the masters might not be ideal narrators of their own prowess. (""We are not a replacement for college,"" Mr. Rogier told me.) ""These people are not teachers,"" said Cole Steffensen, who works in digital marketing while pursuing a career as a stand-up comic. ""It's that awful saying, people who can't do, teach. But the opposite is also true: people who are out there doing stuff don't necessarily make good teachers."" Earlier this year, Mr. Steffensen was gifted a MasterClass subscription by his mother; quarantine provided an occasion for him to work on his writing, so he took classes taught by Aaron Sorkin and David Sedaris. ""It felt very TedTalk-y to me, with people saying really profound things, but maybe not a lot of actionable steps,"" he said. ""You're David Sedaris, telling me what I should be saying to my publisher. I don't have a publisher."""
31116,China's Space Station May Crash to Earth on April Fools' Day,"Experts predict the abandoned space station, Tiangong-1, will fall back to Earth around this weekend. But the risk to anyone on the ground is almost nil.","A rocket carrying China's first space station, Tiangong-1, lifted off on Sept. 29, 2011. China lost control of the station about two years ago.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/27/science/27spacestation-1/27spacestation-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=793c9916acc104af7fca8ef63bf95c5822fd00b882aa365fa43128bdc3575342&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/science/falling-chinese-space-station-tiangong-1.html,d5bfaaa5-90ba-59e2-a1e9-564f281bf9e2.jpg,"The sky is falling. Again. China's first space station, Tiangong-1, abandoned and out of control, is expected to drop out of orbit around this weekend, with pieces of it likely to survive the fiery re-entry and crash somewhere on Earth. According to space debris experts, the chances that you personally will be hit by of a chunk of space metal are essentially zero -- less than one in a trillion. ""It's really very, very, very tiny odds,"" said Andrew Abraham, an analyst leading efforts to track and predict the demise of the space station at the Aerospace Corporation, a nonprofit that performs research and analysis for the United States Air Force. ""I certainly would worry about things like crossing the street far more than debris from Tiangong."" [Read The Times's coverage of China's Chang'e-4 mission to the moon.] Tim Flohrer, a space debris analyst at the European Space Agency, said the risk is ""significantly smaller than being hit by lightning.""

The same is true for regions south of 42.7 degrees south latitude, but that part is almost entirely unpopulated except for the tip of South America, the bottom part of New Zealand and a few scattered scientific research stations on Antarctica. The European Space Agency just updated its forecast for Tiangong-1's demise, pinpointing its fall anytime from this Friday to next Monday.

Typically, for something that large, 10 percent to 40 percent of the mass will make it all the way to the surface without burning up. The Chinese have not released details of the space station's design, making it difficult to calculate a more precise estimate. China originally planned to use the thrusters to guide Tiangong-1 to splash harmlessly into an ocean. But in 2016, an apparent malfunction ended communications with the spacecraft. (The Chinese have not been very forthcoming about that, either.) Since then, Tiangong-1 has gradually been dropping lower and lower as it rubs up against the wisps of the upper atmosphere. On Monday, it was at an altitude of about 130 miles, dropping more than a mile every day, and its descent is accelerating.

It's difficult to make exact predictions; the atmosphere puffs up and deflates depending on the barrage of particles in the solar wind and how that phenomenon speeds or slows the rate of falling. If a calculation is off by half an hour, the predicted impact site could be on the other side of the planet. Earlier this month, a solar storm appears to have moved up the timetable for the crash by a few hours. Indeed, space agencies like the E.S.A. are using Tiangong-1 as a learning exercise to compare their prediction models. The dynamics of the falling spacecraft can also affect the timing. Radar measurements indicate that Tiangong-1 is tumbling, about once every three minutes, said Stijn Lemmens, an analyst at the E.S.A.'s space debris office in Darmstadt, Germany. But in this case, the tumbling seems to be neither hastening nor extending Tiangong-1's remaining days. Stuff of this size drops out of the sky every year or so. NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, which weighed about 12,000 pounds, made a similar uncontrolled return to Earth in 2011, and 26 large pieces, the heaviest about 330 pounds, were expected to reach the surface. The spacecraft ended up in the Pacific Ocean. Even much larger spacecraft have fallen without hurting people. Skylab, America's first space station, weighed nearly 10 times as much as Tiangong-1 and when it crashed in 1979, pieces landed in Western Australia without incident. When the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated during re-entry in 2003, the seven astronauts aboard were killed, but no one on the ground was hurt as more than 82,000 pieces of debris weighing 85,000 pounds showered the United States from West Texas to southwest Louisiana. Only one person is known to have been hit by space debris. In 1997, a six-inch piece of metal believed to have come from a Delta 2 rocket, brushed the shoulder of Lottie Williams, a woman in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She was not hurt."
32711,Lauren Ridloff's Quiet Power: 'My Life Has Changed in Every Way',"The Broadway debut of the deaf actress in ""Children of a Lesser God"" has brought her accolades. But she's not sure what to make of it all.","The actress Lauren Ridloff, starring in &ldquo;Children of a Lesser God&rdquo; on Broadway, near her Brooklyn home.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/13/arts/13ridloff1/13ridloff1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=9c4cb38d2227e827957cf7454a6c4d3b0ff33524ff5928a83aef346cae858441&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/theater/lauren-ridloff-children-of-a-lesser-god.html,808bd3e4-740d-58b3-b345-3c3a774df7d1.jpg,"Reviews like these are hard to come by. ""Stupendously bold and expressive,"" said The Wall Street Journal. ""Instinctive brilliance,"" said New York magazine. ""Downright powerful,"" said Entertainment Weekly. ""Blistering"" and ""a knockout"" said The New York Times. But Lauren Ridloff, starring on Broadway in ""Children of a Lesser God,"" is so new to the theater world that she's not sure what to make of it. On the day she was nominated for a Drama League award, she wondered, ""Should I be excited?"" as she searched for information about the contest. A week later, glancing at a phone at home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, she beamed as she saw that she had been nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award. And then came the Tony nomination, on a rough morning when her 6-year-old had woken her at 5 a.m., demanding a bath. It's been a long journey in a short time for this 40-year-old former kindergarten teacher who has been deaf since birth, has no professional stage acting experience, and who describes herself on her Google Plus bio as a ""stay at home mama."" As the play's run nears its end, she is taking meetings with casting directors, posing for photographers, signing autographs at the stage door, saying good night to her two boys (the younger son is now 4; both are deaf) via FaceTime. ""My life has changed in every way,"" she said in one of several interviews conducted with the assistance of an American Sign Language interpreter.

By now, Ms. Ridloff's unusual path to Broadway has become a part of the revival's lore. She had left teaching to take care of her boys when the director Kenny Leon reached out, looking for a sign language tutor. They met in a coffee shop and practiced signs for foodstuffs; they went to a museum to learn colors; they walked under a bridge to study transportation. Every Tuesday for a year, she taught him about sign language, and, in the process, about deafness. Mr. Leon, in the early stages of developing a revival of ""Children of a Lesser God,"" had lined up a leading man -- Joshua Jackson, best known for television work including ""The Affair"" -- but no leading lady, so he asked Ms. Ridloff to pinch-hit at an early table read. And just like that, without even auditioning, she won the role.

""If you didn't know her resume, you'd swear she'd been doing this her whole life,"" he said. ""You're dealing with an actress that doesn't know what she's doing, and communicating with her in a language she doesn't speak, and trying to connect another actor to her -- but she had a presence that I thought could transfer easily to the stage, and she has instinct enough that she can't make a false move."" After an initial run last summer at the Berkshire Theater Group, in Stockbridge, Mass. (""It was like a boot camp for me,"" she said), the revival opened on Broadway last month. Critics were underwhelmed by the production, but mesmerized by Ms. Ridloff; sales were soft, and the show's lead producer has announced that its final performance will be May 27.

""I'm sad that this production is shuttering just when it was picking up speed and force,"" Ms. Ridloff said. ""I feel that everybody who has been involved in this story -- cast, crew, even audience members -- has changed and emerged better people. We listened."" More About on Deaf Culture

We asked a few people to share the story behind theirs. The role of Sarah Norman, a cleaning woman who falls for a teacher at a school for the deaf, is a plum one for deaf actresses. Phyllis Frelich won a Tony Award playing the part in the original Broadway production, which opened in 1980, and Marlee Matlin won an Academy Award for the 1986 film adaptation. ""The play had a huge impact on the growing awareness of the deaf community, its culture and American Sign Language,"" Ms. Matlin said by email. And Ms. Ridloff, she said, ""brings a fluidity and lightness to the role that I hadn't seen before."" Some critics have objected to the sexual politics of the play -- a teacher getting involved with a woman he is supposed to be educating -- and its traditionalism -- Sarah's fantasies are domestic, including a microwave and a blender. ""That's where you can see, perhaps, the time period the play comes from, and if the play was rewritten now she might be excited about different things,"" Ms. Ridloff acknowledged. ""But, in her defense, I got really excited about having a Vitamix."" For Ms. Ridloff, the most jarring aspect of doing the play has been that it requires her, in one brief, angry scene, to use her voice, which she had ceased doing at age 13 to prevent people from unfairly assessing her intelligence based on her vocal intelligibility. ""When she gets to that part, that rawness is real,"" said Julie Hochgesang, a childhood friend who teaches linguistics at Gallaudet University. ""And the rest of it -- the woman learning to be her own and being so freaking graceful and strong through all of it -- that's real too."" Ms. Ridloff compares the experience of using her voice during the play to a crotch shot, saying that at first she felt exposed, and vulnerable, and ugly. ""I cried thinking about it,"" she said. ""I lived in fear of that part."" Now, she said, after nearly a year with the role and help from a vocal coach, ""it feels empowering to me -- like finally I own every part of myself."" But she said, ""I don't see myself ever using my voice on a conversational level -- that's just not who I am.""

Ms. Ridloff grew up in Chicago, where she was born into a hearing family. Her father is Mexican-American, and her mother is African-American. She parries a question about her identity, saying, ""What's the point?"" ""For me, culturally, I'm deaf,"" she said. ""I'm a deaf woman, and my life choices are made because of my experience of growing up as a deaf person."" When she was a baby, her parents thought she might have a developmental delay, but by the time she was 2, after moments like the day at the beach when she was the only toddler who didn't turn to look at a passing fire engine, they knew she was deaf. A doctor suggested that the deafness would limit her educational and professional achievement, but her parents refused to accept that -- they set about learning sign language, sent her to Catholic school with hearing children. She did well, and then, when she was 13, she was sent to Washington to attend the Model Secondary School for the Deaf. ""That was an awesome, amazing experience,"" Ms. Ridloff said. ""I was just like everybody else."" She started to pursue the arts, but tentatively. ""I was so scared to be around other people, I selected the least popular activity, and that was ceramics,"" she said. She went on to explore drama -- she was Dorothy in a production of ""The Wiz"" -- and to embrace cheerleading, becoming one of the first deaf cheerleaders to represent the United States in an international competition. She studied creative writing at California State University, Northridge, a school that has become a magnet for deaf students. She was crowned Miss Deaf America in 2000 (""There was no swimsuit competition -- it was about ambassadorship, not beauty, and I did a performance of 'The Giving Tree,' because I love Shel Silverstein."") She also joined Deafywood, a comedy troupe, developing her dance skills.

Hoping to become a children's author (still an aspiration), she moved to New York to study education at Hunter College, and took a job teaching kindergarten and first grade at Public School 347, a Manhattan school for children who are deaf, hard of hearing, or born to deaf parents. ""Other teachers would come down, just to see her sign a book, because of the beauty of how she would read,"" said Gary Wellbrock, her co-teacher. ""What she did in the classroom is very much what she is doing onstage -- even if you don't know sign language, she is setting something up that is drawing people in to her, and you want to watch."" She did a little deaf community theater, some film work for friends, and had a small part in ""Wonderstruck"" (as Pearl, the maid). The role of Sarah has proved to be unexpectedly exhausting. Just as singers tax their vocal cords doing eight shows a week, Ms. Ridloff is experiencing strain on her arms and shoulders as she works to make sure her signing is visible toward the back of the theater. And then there is the furious argument her character has with an apprentice teacher over whether to challenge the school's hiring practices -- a stunning scene in which the characters' signing, which is not translated for the audience, becomes both faster and bigger. ""I'm getting a total workout,"" Ms. Ridloff said. She and her husband, Douglas Ridloff, a deaf artist and performer who oversees a monthly, multicity, American Sign Language poetry slam, live in a tight-knit section of Williamsburg. (One next-door neighbor learned sign language so he could communicate with them.) They don't see a lot of theater, because it's so rarely interpreted for the deaf, and, Mr. Ridloff said, ""I'm not crazy about Broadway shows in general. I'm more of a movie guy."" To maintain her strength, and calm, Ms. Ridloff runs daily, between three and five miles, generally over the Williamsburg Bridge or into Greenpoint, reviewing lines in her head, or trying to meditate. On two-show days, she runs in Central Park between performances. ""Sometimes I'm inside this black box all day, and I forget what people are like,"" she said, noting that, unlike hearing performers, she can't tell when the audience is laughing or crying, restless or rapt, except by watching Mr. Jackson's pacing for cues. ""It's nice to go out and look at people, to think about their movements and interactions, and I can bring all that with me."""
42679,Can a Fake Tan Make You Look Thinner?,The celebrity makeup pro Charlotte Tilbury offers tips and tricks for how to shade the truth.,Charlotte Tilbury performs a demo on how to look skinnier by applying self tanner.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/08/fashion/08SKIN1/08SKIN1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=146e4c7e43d304fddc95ff685d2445438710e54cfc723bb3bb365662d3bbe06a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/fashion/can-a-fake-tan-make-you-look-thinner.html,5420526e-e05b-581e-8414-1e5934dacb86.jpg,"Rather than roast in the sun, and in all likelihood bring on sun damage, sun spots and other hot weather woes, self-tanner has become a reliable solution for faking a bronzed glow. The formulas have been improved so much -- less streaky! less orange! -- that, with some practice, you can use them to contour. The makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury has plenty of personal experience with the product. ""Being one of the whitest girls in the world, and with my red hair, I was obsessed with how to get the best self-tan,"" she said. Sometimes she starts with a self-tan base and then enhances her color during the day with a light dusting of bronzer or layers on a sheer tint to add depth. All in all, the goal is to ""cheat,"" she said, adding, ""It's to look leaner and longer and also more youthful and glowing."" Here, Ms. Tilbury walks us through the self-tanner application process, adding a few tips and tricks for carving out cheekbones and elongating limbs.

STEP 1 To ensure an even application, you should prep the skin with a body exfoliator to remove dead skin. This way, the self-tan won't grab onto any dead skin cells, said Ms. Tilbury, who prefers Tatcha Indigo Smoothing Black Sugar Body Gommage ($74). She rubs the scrub up and down and then in circular motions for a thorough finish. STEP 3 Add self-tanner to an applicator mitt. Ms. Tilbury likes Loving Tan bronzing mousse ($34.95), which she discovered from the beauty bloggers Desi Perkins and Katy DeGroot, a.k.a. Lustrelux, for its believable color. Then apply in circular motions on arms, legs and other desired areas before pulling the product upward.

""You do the circular motions so you won't be left with any marks, and the upward motion helps elongate,"" Ms. Tilbury said. For tricky areas like the elbows and ankles, where self-tanner may be prone to stick, she adds some of her Magic Cream moisturizer ($100) after the self-tanner to help the product spread more easily.

STEP 4 Use the self-tanner base about two or three days in a row. ""Once you have a base, you can start contouring your body and cheating to make yourself look longer and leaner,"" Ms. Tilbury said. With the mitt or a big round brush, apply self-tanner down only the sides of the legs, while using small circular motions so you won't be left with an obvious streak. Repeat these steps on the outer sides of the arms.

STEP 1 Exfoliate the day of the application, or even a day before. Ms. Tilbury likes the Enzyme Peeling Mask by Georgia Louise ($120). STEP 2 Overnight self-tanners have come into vogue in recent years. Ms. Tilbury created her own, the Overnight Bronze and Glow Mask ($55), to moisturize and calm the skin as well as deliver a wash of color. Whatever product you choose, she said, it is important that it has ""moisturizing agents, so it doesn't attach to freckles, and that the color is very, very subtle."" Apply all over, as you would a moisturizer, she said, and then ""make sure you go up into the hairline, under and down the neck, and into the decolletage."" ""And when you're doing your cheeks,"" she continued, ""don't forget to drag up to your ears.""

STEP 4 Once you're familiar with your self-tanning product, you can try creating definition. After using the self-tanner over your entire face for two or three days in a row, use a large brush to apply self-tanner to just your cheekbones and jawline. Suck in your cheeks and follow the hollows with circular motions up to the temple. Then, using the same brush, sweep self-tanner along the jawline. Be sure to blend, using the same concise circular motions. STEP 5 But leave the more complicated contouring to makeup, Ms. Tilbury advised. ""It's tough to shape your chin or nose with self-tanner,"" she said. ""It can easily get dodgy."" Using her Filmstar Bronze and Glow duo ($68), she applies the contour color to further deepen the cheek hollows and jawline. Then she dusts the highlighter color on top of the cheekbones, down the nose and on the bow of the mouth."
44813,An Outdoor Wonderland Around the Washington-Idaho Border,A fishing expedition was part of a cheap getaway that centered around the states' spectacular natural beauty — with some quality food in the mix.,"City Park and its accompanying beach in downtown Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/24/travel/24frugal1/24frugal1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9bda0724e312d0177b1444d002233fb38f84069858eeb4f4987328163885a555&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/travel/washington-idaho-fishing-restaurants-budget.html,b6c6298b-6d62-521c-8f09-8214d0fcf999.jpg,"The fishing rod on the starboard aft side (or back corner -- I was proud of myself for learning some navigation terms) of our little vessel sprang taut, like a bowstring. Our guide, Shane Moon, jumped to his feet with a quickness I didn't expect from a guy who looks like he could play lineman for a college football team. ""O.K., we've got one,"" he said. The sun hadn't yet shown its face in the purplish-blue sky, but it was light out, maybe 5:30 in the morning, and dozens of boats dotted a wide section of the Columbia River where it forks. I was excited. I had gotten a fish, and it was still pretty early, so I was feeling good about the prospects for the day. The question: Would I be able to keep it? ""Let's hope it's a king,"" Mr. Moon said as he scooped it up into the net. It was not a king, or Chinook salmon. It was a fat, silvery sockeye salmon, and Mr. Moon shook his head. He cut it loose and the fish wriggled away, disappearing into the bluish-gray water. It wasn't the first time this would happen. Washington State carefully monitors its rivers and lakes, giving constant updates on what fishermen are and are not allowed to keep, and sockeye had just been placed on the no-fish list. The catch-and-retain window, I was learning, is extremely narrow. We were looking for king salmon, but it could not be wild -- it had to be from a hatchery (a clipped fin is the giveaway). Patience and acceptance were just a couple of lessons I learned during a not-always-fruitful but highly instructive fishing expedition, part of a cheap getaway in Washington and Idaho that centered around the states' spectacular natural beauty -- with some quality food in the mix. I'd booked a ""Long Weekender"" package through the Hilton Honors app, which offered a 50 percent discount on Sunday night during a three-night stay. My first two nights at the Hampton Inn & Suites Spokane Valley cost $139, and so the third night was a mere $69. The hotel was comfortable enough, but, most importantly, it was a good home base for heading back and forth in my $22-per-day Alamo rental car between Spokane, Wash., and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 25 minutes away on Interstate 90.

Lounging and sunbathing (it was hot that weekend) was the pastime of choice when I was there, but other outdoor activities are widely available: Cruises on the Saint Joe River are offered, as well as kayaking ($9 per hour), parasailing (from $65 per person) and something called a SUPsquatch -- a massive paddleboard that fits up to 9 people ($50 per hour). The park also hosts weekly summer concerts; I attended a fun performance by Bram Brata, a steel drum ensemble. I wanted to do a little kayaking, but decided I would hunt for a slightly better deal. I found it at Fun Unlimited in Post Falls, which offers a three-hour, early-bird kayaking special from 9 a.m. until noon for just $22. After signing a quick waiver, I paddled east on the Spokane River, toward McCabe's Island, then turned back around and went toward the site of the town's first lumber mill, now the Post Falls Dam. It was a perfect day for kayaking -- just be careful of motorized watercraft. After kayaking, it was easy enough to visit Post Falls Park, a small but picturesque green space on the Spokane. The views of the dam are great, as well as those of the pretty-but-inaccessible Avista Bridge. You can, though, do what I did and trek down past the rocks to the Spokane itself and hike a bit along the river.

Tubbs Hill, 120 acres of hiking trails and public park, offers a great way to stretch your legs and take in panoramic views of Coeur d'Alene and the surrounding area. I parked on South 10th Street, on the hill's backside, and entered the trails from there. I spent an hour or two on the hill before realizing how hungry I'd gotten. Fortunately, Hudson's Hamburgers, a no-frills spot that's been in business for an impressive 110 years, wasn't far away. Best of all, the simple double cheeseburger with onions, pickles and spicy mustard ($5.60), was everything a burger should be. Service was efficient but cordial. ""Never had a TV ad, a radio ad, nothin',"" said Steve Hudson, the owner, from behind the counter. The rest of Coeur d'Alene doesn't skimp on quality food, either -- I had good drip coffee ($2.30) from Vault, the resident hip coffee shop, and enjoyed the Greek Village Salad from Olympia Restaurant on East Lakeside Avenue, a mountain of fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and red onion. The most surprising spot was Daft Badger Brewing, a fun and busy brewpub smack in the middle of a residential street. (""It might be why we close relatively early,"" my server told me.) They have a refreshing (and potent) Blood Orange I.P.A. that is hearty without overdoing it on the hops ($5). It went well with a Not Your Mother's BLT Sandwich, which added sundried-tomato mayo and provolone cheese to the classic formula ($11.95).

Lest Idaho take all the glory, there was just as much good grub and quality suds on the other side of the border. In fact, the deal I found at The Wandering Table in Spokane was probably the single best deal of my trip. The chic spot just west of Riverfront Park allows for a near-luxurious lunch experience for a pittance. Customers can choose three dishes that individually range from $12 to $20 on the menu for a total of $15. I had a salad of charred broccoli with drop peppers and pine nuts, a healthy portion of albacore tuna in rice wine with pickled pears and a jalapeno aioli, and two immodestly large chicken wings slathered in a sticky Vietnamese glaze. It was all quite good, and entirely too much. Garageland on West Riverside Avenue is another good spot to grab a quick bite, in a slightly more casual setting. And I can also recommend Zola's as an option for a solid meal and a beer, especially on Sundays when there's an all-day happy hour. If the collegiate vibe at Zola's is not your thing, head to The Observatory, where the mood is more tattoos, board games and microbrews.

With such a bevy of food and natural splendor in the Spokane/Coeur d'Alene area, it does raise the question -- Why did I travel so far (Brewster, where I booked my trip with Moon's Guide Service, is 130 miles from Spokane) to go fishing? Believe me: I asked myself the same question as I drove bleary-eyed toward the Grand Coulee Dam in the middle of the night. The answer, naturally, was price. Mr. Moon offered an eight-hour trip for just $200 -- about half of what some guides were offering. Additionally, salmon fishing wasn't quite as weather-dependent as fly fishing, also popular in the area -- I reached out about fly-fishing lessons to a shop in Coeur d'Alene, only to have the class canceled at the last minute because it was too windy.

By sunrise, I could see at least 50 boats on the water. Our craft was typical -- four poles, a complicated downrigger system and a collection of high-tech screens and remote controls that I couldn't begin to understand. Fishing, I learned, is as expensive a hobby as you would like to make it. ""By the time you get yourself a truck and boat,"" Mr. Moon said, ""some of these guys are a hundred grand in the hole."" The downrigger system, Mr. Moon said, allows for accurate targeting of a specific depth. It essentially looks like a miniature building crane that accompanies the fishing pole, and drops a lead weight in to your preferred depth, attached with a clip to the fishing line to keep the hook at the specified number of feet below water. When a fish bites, the clip breaks free and the pole springs up. After my initial sockeye bite, things slowed down considerably. Still, the river was serenely beautiful, even with dozens of other boats on the water, and the deep purple sky had become a pale yellow. Mr. Moon was philosophical. ""Bites will turn on, bites will turn off,"" he said. ""The thing with instinct and aggression is that one day the fish'll like one thing, next day they won't touch it."" We caught a couple of more sockeyes and a Dolly Varden trout, but threw them back. Mr. Moon admitted that some people cheat, keeping illicit fish, but he stuck to the rules. ""Sometimes I find myself saying, 'Man, I never thought I'd be throwing back a 40-pound king,'"" he said. By 11 a.m., the sun was pounding down on us. ""Nice day,"" he shouted at an acquaintance in a passing boat, and snorted. ""'Nice day' means 'this fishing is -'"" he said to me, finishing the sentence with an unprintable word indicating it was not good. But he tried to turn things around: ""C'mon, let's catch something!"" Alas, the elusive hatchery king salmon we were looking for weren't cooperating. A sizable king teasingly jumped out of the water a few meters ahead of us. ""What do you want?"" he asked it. Over eight hours later, it was nearing 1 p.m. and we decided to call it a day. Three sockeye and one Dolly Varden later, the little cooler I'd bought from Wal-Mart on the way over remained empty. ""I tell my customers,"" Mr. Moon said, ""I guarantee you will catch a fish."" He emphasized the word ""catch"" -- no promises about keeping. I would have loved to keep a fish but I left happy, feeling vaguely instilled with a kind of wisdom: What is it they say about teaching a man to fish?"
8927,Ennio Morricone in Eight Moments,"The spaghetti westerns were only the beginning. His scores turned horror, romance and more into transcendent works of art.","Ennio Morricone's scores elevated filmmakers' work, as with Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" starring Clint Eastwood.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/arts/10a2_video/07morricone-stream1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=432&w=826&s=ea3bb5618798907d943dc8575aad394bacc8466227cdc13ad8c7e1725c9fa8d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/movies/ennio-morricone-film-scores.html,5f5679ee-f9db-5277-b908-e3859da5ba72.jpg,"A composer who thought in terms of molten-guitar melodrama and wailing choral grandeur, Ennio Morricone, who died on Monday at 91, scored movies the way their biggest fans heard them in their heads. He believed in the films no matter how ridiculous, celebrating and amplifying their feelings into something transcendent. (Morricone was often more successful at doing this than their directors or screenwriters.) If we allow ourselves to think about spaghetti westerns as touched by a sense of cosmic fate, or horror slashers as occasionally gorgeous, Morricone is certainly to thank for that. He was a kindred spirit to visionaries like Sergio Leone, Dario Argento, Brian De Palma, John Carpenter and Quentin Tarantino (all five collaborated with him) -- that is to say, he was a supremely talented addict to the rush of genre filmmaking. To understand Morricone's genius, it's better to explore the deep cuts.

The twangy, galloping, ay-ay-ay-ing main title of Leone's action epic is more famous, but revisit the film's wordless climax, set on a cracked-stone clearing where the antagonists shoot it out over stolen gold coins, and you'll appreciate how adventurous Morricone's art was. The composer multiplies the unbearable tension of the stare-down with each added instrument: a Spanish guitar (gloriously out of tune), a blaring trumpet, skittering castanets, delicate chimes, even what sounds like a reverb-drenched amplifier being tipped over. Colored by avant-garde liberation, it's a sonic palette that was uniquely his.

Mario Bava's kitschy comics-based crime film has its superfans (the Beastie Boys once built a whole video around it), but Morricone's groovy, psychedelic-tinged additions have more personality than the masked antihero, played by John Phillip Law. Trained at the Santa Cecilia classical conservatory in his native Italy, Morricone was also seasoned in jazz and pop, meaning he could lounge it up with the best of them. ""Deep Down,"" this movie's flirty fuzz-guitar-laden theme song cooed by the chanteuse Maria Cristina Brancucci, deserves to be more widely known. It's easily better than maybe all but three James Bond tunes. 'Once Upon a Time in the West'

Another Leone western moment is merited here, and this violent reveal from the director's mighty 1968 summation work is the most shocking scene of his career. He lets a child's point of view bring us into the scene, rushing down a hallway and almost smacking us into Morricone's savage electric guitar crunch. The boy and his farming family will soon be gone, rubbed out by the menacing men who materialize from the scrub and dark orchestral swells. Their leader? None other than the classic American good guy Henry Fonda, breaking bad in a perverse piece of casting. Morricone makes the betrayal feel like a gut punch.

It's impossible to reflect on Italy's tradition of giallo -- stylish thrillers prone to black-gloved killers in close-up -- and not smile at their creepy aural signatures, often supplied by Morricone in a steady side gig. His work on Argento's enormously influential breakthrough film is a nightmare in your ear holes: twinkly lullaby chimes and slightly deranged la-la-la singing. Talk to disciples of Morricone's weirdest soundtracks and they'll steer you toward titles like ""A Lizard in a Woman's Skin"" (1971), ""What Have You Done to Solange?"" (1972) and ""Spasmo"" (1974). Still, take your time with that journey in the dark; here's the place to start.

Elio Petri's Kafkaesque police satire, about a corrupt inspector (Gian Maria Volonte) who kills his mistress and hopes to get caught, would be almost unbearably bleak as a piece of entertainment if played straight. Fortunately, Morricone's score, the product of an especially inspired and fecund period, functions as a mischievous counterbalance. Mincing mandolins, conspiratorial bassoons and the prominent sproing of a mouth harp coalesce into a nudge that helps ground our reaction in black comedy. In his recent reappraisal, J. Hoberman called Morricone's score ""cartoonish."" It's also a stealth commentary built into the film itself.

Golden-hour-hued and exquisitely pastoral, Terrence Malick's Texas-set drama has such a visual fineness to it, you can almost feel the softness of the air. Even in conjunction with knockout cinematography (of such uglies as Richard Gere, Brooke Adams and Sam Shepard), Morricone's contribution stands out, particularly this cue, wavering between natural order and an underlying tension. The composer notoriously butted heads with Malick, who was as demanding as they come. Nonetheless -- or perhaps because of it -- Morricone produced some of his most aching passages.

Music bridges cultures and connects listeners to a conception of the divine (no matter how arbitrarily imposed) in Roland Joffe's sumptuous religious drama. Tapping into his love of heavenly harmonies and contrapuntal elegance, Morricone composed an oboe melody for Jeremy Irons, playing an 18th-century Spanish Jesuit missionary in South America. His priest performs it in the jungle for a tribe of Indigenous Guarani. The solo has to function as an initiation: beguiling, innocent, unthreatening. Morricone expands it into a theme underpinning one of his most beloved scores, better known than the film itself.

This may be Morricone's masterpiece (partly composed with his son Andrea), in which his churning, romantic score supplies the final catharsis -- the belated viewing of a lost reel of kisses from old films -- in the absence of dialogue. Giuseppe Tornatore's Oscar winner is about a boy enchanted by movies who grows up to be a cynical, faithless director. His memories of youth, first love and a kindly projectionist (Philippe Noiret) are the basis for the story's four-alarm nostalgia fire, deeply indebted to Federico Fellini. If you're too cool for it, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is easy to dismiss, but we Morriconians see you discreetly wiping a tear from the corner of your eye."

Though he gets about in a motorized scooter, he has not let his myotonic dystrophy, a disease involving progressive muscle loss, curtail his travels. His father, Barry M. Cohen, 72, a retired industrial psychologist, acts as his travel companion, and together the two Floridians have written a book, ""Travel Near & Travel Far: Step Out of Your Disabled World!"" that provides both encouragement for disabled travelers and practical advice on navigating the world from a scooter or wheelchair. The elder Mr. Cohen recently discussed the book; here are excerpts from that conversation.

Q. Why should people with disabilities travel?

A. There actually are medical reasons to travel. People who have disabilities and travel have a much easier time sleeping. They're not as stressed as other people. Particularly if they are in the house and confined, traveling is an incredible way to grow yourself as a person and impact your mind. And travel can produce long-term health benefits such as using leisure as a coping mechanism for stress. People who have disabilities unfortunately don't get as much activity as other people. But when they're in travel mode, they do get activity, which actually contributes to their overall heath.

What are the characteristics of a good travel companion?

The right travel companion can make or break a trip. First is conscientiousness. It takes a person who is going to help the disabled person even if it means personal inconvenience and sacrifice. Second, you want a person who's caring and thoughtful, because they can recognize and appreciate the physical limitations of the person traveling. Number three, you need a person who can remain cool under fire and doesn't get upset when they're faced with setbacks. Physical strength is important. You have to at certain points lift up the wheelchair or scooter to get it into something or another.

What destinations have been friendliest for those with disabilities?

The U.S. and Canada are extremely friendly. The best in Europe is Germany. When you take a train, for example, in a lot of countries there's a space between the platform and train. In Berlin, at every station, you can request that the engineer come out and put a special piece of equipment between the train and the platform. In Thailand, the king who recently died ordered the government to have attendants stationed in every handicapped bathroom to help the disabled."

They Built a Home, and With It, a Collection

HOUSTON -- Bill and Susanne Pritchard had long wanted to build a house from the ground up. In 2009, they hired the architect Allan Greenberg to design their dream home in Houston, where they were raising four children, and spent a week in New York scouting galleries for what might go on the walls. They both fell in love with Richard Pousette-Dart's 1960 abstract canvas ""Blue Presence,"" with dappled sedimentary layers of soft blue, green, white and sand-toned pigments. It now hangs in the dining room of their grand red brick Federal-style home showcasing Abstract Expressionist paintings by Hans Hofmann, Helen Frankenthaler, Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell, among newer works. ""We built the house largely around this Pousette-Dart painting,"" said Mr. Pritchard, a geologist in the oil and gas business. This first acquisition helped guide wall colors and textile choices and pointed the couple toward the midcentury New York School as an area of focus. ""When we started, we really didn't think we'd be art collectors,"" Mrs. Pritchard said. She was amused to reread a 2009 email she wrote to her mother saying they were thinking of buying ""five or six paintings for the house.""

Today, with some 80 works on the walls and as trustees at the Menil Collection (him) and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (her), the couple regularly opens their home to visiting museum groups. Over time, the Pritchards have evolved in their tastes and expanded the parameters of their collecting.

Their most recent acquisition is Roy Lichtenstein's tabletop sculpture ""Brushstroke Head II,"" a Pop Art riff on the kind of gestures seen in the Pritchards' nearby drawing of a woman by Willem de Kooning. They are now buying contemporary works including a geometric abstraction by Sarah Morris, a black-and-white silk-screen by Christopher Wool, a Bruce Nauman neon, and a monumental gridded canvas by Gunther Forg that the couple is loaning to the artist's retrospective later this year at the Dallas Museum of Art (which also borrowed their black and white Pollock). Two side-by-side anthropomorphic vases by Picasso are painted with the faces of a king and queen, her eyes seeming to throw a side glance toward him. ""That's representative of our relationship,"" mused Mr. Pritchard.

MR. PRITCHARD I've never thought about it that way, but geology is a lot more abstract than engineering -- just being able to visualize things in the subsurface, particularly when you're searching for oil. At my company, Indigo, on the walls are these beautifully colored maps on the thicknesses of zones and the structures that look very similar to the paintings on the walls here. How would you describe your collecting approach? MR. PRITCHARD I'm impulsive. She does the research. MRS. PRITCHARD We love going to shows like Art Basel Miami or the ADAA [the Art Show of the Art Dealers Association of America] in New York. We've also bought at auctions. That can be frustrating when you get into a bidding war.

Do you have a favorite piece in the collection? MRS. PRITCHARD I would say the Pousette-Dart. It started everything. We had never spent that much on almost anything before. MR. PRITCHARD We just love it for sentimental value. But Pousette-Dart's trajectory seems to be improving more recently at the auctions. We've never sold anything and have no plans to ever sell anything, but it's always nice to know your artists are doing well."

SHOULD you ever find yourself in this town, about an hour and a half north of Manhattan, and come across an old white pickup with its hood and tailgate painted black, you might chalk up the two-tone paint job to a D.I.Y. project gone awry. But you'd be wrong. In fact, the handiwork was performed decades ago by one of the pillars of the Minimalist art movement, Donald Judd. Judd, who stopped making paintings in the 1960s and died in 1994, was known for his geometrically precise sculptures and installations. In 1971, he moved from New York City to Marfa, then a dying town in the high desert of West Texas, less than 100 miles from Mexico. ""Because of the glare, he painted the hood black to kill the reflection,"" said Evan Hughes, who bought the 1972 Dodge Power Wagon 200 from Judd's son, Flavin, in 2000.

Judd didn't stop there. He painted the tailgate and the bumpers black, which gave the truck its distinctive look. The doors of the truck bear the symbol of one of Judd's ranches in Marfa, which is known for its treeless -- and flat -- landscape. ""I don't think it ever went up a hill before it got here,"" said Mr. Hughes, referring to the very different terrain in the upstate area where he lives. One brisk Sunday afternoon this fall, the old Dodge was parked in Mr. Hughes's driveway under a tall canopy of elm, maple and oak, all a week or so away from peak color. Mr. Hughes, a furniture maker, wore a black shirt, bluejeans and black shoes. When he spoke of the truck, he sounded like a docent leading a museum tour. In many ways, the truck is an artifact.

""It's pretty much as it was,"" he said. He noted some points of interest: a winch on the bumper spooled with 100 feet of cable, passes for Judd's trips into Mexico on the rear window and a first-aid kit mounted on the driver's door. Unsnapping the wire clasp that holds the tin cover in place, he demonstrated that the kit was still fully stocked (with, among other things, ammonia inhalants, aspirin and an eye patch). In a compartment along the side of the truck, Mr. Hughes dusted off old engine belts, an owner's manual and a rusted metal container that could have been used for ammunition. He had removed a gun rack when he bought the truck, and to make more room in the cargo bed, Mr. Hughes also removed a toolbox and a water tank. ""This was really equipped for the desert,"" he said. ""In case you get lost or stuck, there's nothing for miles.""

Before Judd arrived, there was not much to know about Marfa aside from two pieces of trivia: it was a location for the 1956 film ""Giant,"" one of James Dean's three starring roles, and it was where the mysterious phenomenon of the Marfa Lights, unpredictable flickerings in the sky of unknown origin, were sometimes seen. ""He called it a featureless landscape,"" Mr. Hughes said. ""There are mountain ranges in the background, but there's no real landmarks.""

Judd bought ranches, abandoned buildings and the remains of Fort D. A. Russell, a closed military base. With the help of the Dia Art Foundation, he turned the base into a museum, naming it the Chinati Foundation, after the mountains. ""He grew dissatisfied with New York because it didn't have big enough spaces or pristine enough spaces for his artwork,"" Mr. Hughes said. ""One of his ideas about art was to have context, sort of the perfect sculpture in the perfect space and kept that way."" Mr. Hughes was quick to note that he was not a Judd worshiper, but he does identify with the artist, who dabbled in furniture design. ""My interests have always been in art, architecture and furniture -- together. Which fits perfectly with what Donald Judd has always been into,"" he said. Mr. Hughes is a soft-spoken man with chestnut hair and close-trimmed beard. He has been a furniture designer for 32 years, since graduating from the Rochester Institute of Technology. He moved to Brooklyn in 1990 and, based on the recommendation of a friend, he made his way to Marfa in 1997. After he bought an apartment complex downtown that required some work, he went looking for a truck to haul material for the renovation. The connection to the truck, Mr. Hughes said, came through his friendship with Judd's son, Flavin, who was looking for practical transportation after the birth of his second child. Mr. Hughes bought the Dodge, which had a little more than 68,000 miles on it at the time, for less than $5,000.

Though Mr. Hughes and his wife, Lynn McCary, an event planner, have nothing but fondness for Marfa, their lives and jobs continued to pull them back to New York. In addition to building furniture, Mr. Hughes fabricates art pieces. He recently built sculptures for the artist Richard Artschwager for a show in Rome. He also built pieces that were included in an Artschwager retrospective at the Whitney Museum this month. Finding time to visit Marfa is not easy. ""It's very isolated,"" Mr. Hughes said. ""It's 13 hours from New York. You fly in to El Paso and then drive three hours south to Marfa. You can get to a lot of places in 13 hours."" Mr. Hughes eventually shipped the truck to New York. His main residence is in Brooklyn. But, he said, driving the truck ""around the city is just crazy."" It has no radio or air-conditioning. The engine is a 360 V-8 with a 4-speed manual transmission, and it's geared very low. ""It does not go much more than 75 miles per hour,"" he said. Here in Putnam Valley, Mr. Hughes does not ask much of the truck aside from hauling firewood and some light construction. Like the art of its first owner, he noted, the truck is quite minimalist. ""It's not more than what you need,"" he said."

Since the last recession, only three major enclosed malls have been built in the United States.



SARASOTA, Fla. -- It's hard to conceive of a city that needs a new shopping mall in a country overpopulated with shopping sprawl. Yet about 10 years ago, the Taubman Centers, the national mall developer, teamed up with the Benderson Development Company, a real estate firm with headquarters in Sarasota, to build the 880,000-square-foot Mall at University Town Center east of Sarasota, close to Interstate 75. As it turned out, the timing could not have been worse. After the 2008 economic crisis, people stopped driving when they could and certainly stopped shopping with any gusto. In the more than six years since the recession, only three major enclosed malls were built in the United States. So far the Sarasota mall is doing well, according to William S. Taubman, the firm's chief operating officer. Nevertheless, no one is disclosing numbers that would help measure any success for the mall, which opened in October.

Mr. Taubman credits the rising stock market, rather than the decline in gas prices, for motivating shoppers. ""People don't decide to buy a Chanel bag because the price of gas goes down 4 cents,"" Mr. Taubman said in a telephone interview. ""It has more to do with the stock market."" The gleaming two-story mall is anchored by an 80,000-square-foot Saks Fifth Avenue along with a Macy's and a Dillard's. Both Saks and Macy's closed stores at nearby malls to open at the new mall. There is also a roster of brand-name stores including Michael Kors, Godiva, Apple and even a Tesla car showroom. The upscale chain restaurant of choice these days is Capital Grille, which made its Sarasota debut at the mall. The Saks has a Sophie's restaurant, named for the wife of Bernard Gimbel, one of the chain's founders. Only two other Saks stores have a Sophie's. Sarasota County is leading a group that is developing a rowing park on a body of water next to the mall. ""The 2017 world championship rowing competition will be held there,"" said Mark Chait, executive director of leasing at Benderson, adding that Benderson intends to build hotels on the mall property. The mall's owners have reason to be optimistic. Sarasota's tourist numbers have risen smartly, with many visitors from the Midwest, Britain and Canada, said Tom Heatherman, head of communications at Michael Saunders & Company, a real estate firm based in Sarasota.

In 2008, Sarasota attracted 769,000 tourists, measured by those who stayed in paid lodging, who spent an estimated $587 million. Last year, it lured 998,770 visitors, who spent an estimated $1.57 billion, according to Visit Sarasota County, which tracks tourism data for the county. And where construction of new hotels had stalled, now a number of properties are on the schedule for the next several years. Among them are a Kimpton, a Westin and a Marriott. A spate of construction on new high-priced apartments is also underway. At the Vue, which is expected to be completed in the next year and a half, prices for apartments range from $800,000 to well over $3 million, and the building is 85 percent sold. Thomas B. Luzier, a real estate lawyer at Dunlap & Moran in Sarasota, says there has been a strong increase in the prices for high-end homes. They ranged from $1 million to $2 million, he noted, but recently there has been an increase in sales in the $2 million-to-$4 million range.

Many of the new hotels are in downtown Sarasota, however, not near the new mall. Jeff Green, an independent retail consultant in Phoenix, is not so certain about long-term prospects for the mall, which is about a 25-minute drive from St. Armands Circle, a popular tourist shopping area on a key. St. Armands has the advantage of being a brand-name shopping destination near an affluent community and beaches, with a healthy mix of national and local stores, he said.

""What I question about the new mall site is that it is far from the affluent families who live on the coast,"" he said. ""How do you pull them past St. Armands all the way over to the east side?"" Because of St. Armands's location, the mall is less likely to affect stores there than businesses in the city's other malls, Mr. Green said. ""It is not a very big pie to be sliced so many ways."" But Mr. Taubman said he saw an opportunity. ""We were looking for the customer who is making $100,000 and more. We thought we saw a hole in the market,"" he said. ""There was no dominant upscale mall. The area needed to be satisfied with a better shopping venue."" The mall could attract shoppers from Fort Myers, south of Sarasota, and northward from Tampa, he said. The Mall at University Town Center is also accessible to a wide range of local shoppers, including families living at nearby Lakewood Ranch, a residential development with 9,000 homes. Heather Kasten, who heads the Lakewood Ranch Business Alliance, said the average household income at Lakewood Ranch was $100,000. The mall seems carefully aimed at that market. It is not inundated with ultraluxury brands like Hermes so that a middle-income customer would feel uncomfortable shopping there, said D.J. Busch, an analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, Calif., which follows the real estate industry. ""It is a little bit of a step down from the Taubmans' traditional tenant, but still a middle- to upper-income customer,"" Mr. Busch said.

""Tesla does not have to be the highest of the high end,"" he said. ""For those tenants, the mall would have a Maserati store. Taubman picks the right tenants very well. Taking the highest rent is not necessarily the best strategy for a center. They are careful about picking the appropriate tenants for that market."" Despite the new hotels, the Ritz-Carlton is not likely to find new competition in the luxury category. Though its main hotel is not on the Gulf of Mexico, it has its own beach club in a city where there is not much beachfront property available for construction. ""If you have a luxury brand, you have to have beachfront,"" said Herve Humler, president of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. A number of experts expect the tourist traffic at St. Armands to remain robust. The bigger question is the future for the Mall at University Town Center and the Main Street shopping area, which is on the mainland and not as close to the beaches and some of the upscale residential areas. The coming hotels are largely planned for the Main Street area, where there are national chain stores, including a Brooks Brothers and a J. McLaughlin, and some of Sarasota's more popular restaurants. ""When Whole Foods came to Main Street, there was a thought that a more sophisticated customer would follow,"" Mr. Green said. ""Sur La Table did come, because they like to be near Whole Foods. But the sort of gentrification they were looking for is not occurring."" That may be partly because retailers are being lured to the new mall. Norman Gollub, the downtown economic development coordinator for the Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce, counters that there is only a 5 percent vacancy rate downtown and the notion that the mall would hurt that market is not proving true."

The South Carolina Sea Islands and the Gullah Geechee people who have endured there are increasingly buffeted by economic and social change -- not to mention lethal storms.

, where the Gullah Geechee culture has endured since the days of slavery.

On an overcast June day, I parked my car under a live oak outside a weathered-looking church on St. Helena Island, S. C. I'd interrupted our family vacation for an outing to some of the cultural sites on this island where the Gullah Geechee culture has endured since the days of slavery. My nephews and son had grumbled a little about missing a day on the Atlantic beach, but fell silent as we tramped up the steep stairs to the balcony once reserved for enslaved people. My family has been visiting the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina for more than 20 years, but, like many tourists, we had usually blown through St. Helena without stopping. The island has no grocery store, no public beaches and only a few restaurants. At first glance, there wasn't much to see, but a little research into the island's history had shown me that the Gullah Geechee culture that has mostly faded from the neighboring islands was alive and well there. The Gullah Geechee are descendants of West Africans who were brought to America's southeastern coast more than two centuries ago and inhabit regions including the Georgia and South Carolina Lowcountry. The Gullah Geechee historically spoke their own distinctive Creole language, and still maintain customs and traditions that make them a unique subculture within the African diaspora.

It made sense to begin with Brick Baptist Church, one of the oldest and most historic structures on the island. The church was built by the slaveholding landowners of the area. Though open to tourists, the church is maintained by a devoted congregation whose bulletins could be seen tucked into the racks on the long white pews. When we got to the top of the stairs, my 8-year-old nephew, Jake, looked back at me, confused. ""The slaves had to sit up here?"" he asked. ""You mean they weren't allowed down there?"" He pointed over the low wall to the red-carpeted first floor. ""But why?"" I made sure to explain that while Brick Baptist is a visible reminder of the ugly inequities of slavery, the beautiful church was also a powerful symbol of the struggle for civil rights. My 6-year-old son Henry's interest in the history was quickly exhausted, but his older cousins comprehended it better, and were interested to learn that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. practiced his ""I Have a Dream"" speech in the Brick Baptist Church before the March on Washington in 1963.

At lunch, I had a hard time choosing between crab soup and gumbo but finally settled on the crab soup, which was peppery and full of fresh local crab. My son Henry, normally a picky eater, ordered the barbecued chicken and finished it in five minutes flat. Though rooted in local traditions, the Greens take some liberties -- for instance, choosing to cook their vegetables and rice without meat to reduce saturated fat. The white rice and collard greens that I ordered on the side were delicious, and nothing seemed to be missing. After our day in Frogmore, I decided that I'd seen as much of the hidden side of the Sea Islands as I was likely to see without the help of a local. The Beaufort Visitors Center led me to Bill Reynolds, who runs van tours of the area under the name Beaufort Tours LLC. His most popular booking is the movie tour, which takes visitors on a leisurely hourlong trip to sites made famous by movies including ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Prince of Tides."" I chose the Plantation and Gullah Tour, which departs from the Downtown Marina. After another brief visit to Penn Center, we headed back out to St. Helena for a stop at the picturesque ruins of the St. Helena Parish Chapel of Ease, an 18th-century church built for plantation families who lived too far from Beaufort to make it to the mainland for Sunday services. On the grounds of the church, among the live oaks and shaggy, overgrown palmettos, Bill told me about Robert Smalls, a Beaufort native and former slave who began his career by taking the Confederate steamer he piloted and sailing it through the Union blockade. After the war, Smalls was elected to Congress and bought the Beaufort house that had been the home of his former master.

Although Smalls lost his seat in 1886, he remained active in Beaufort politics and community affairs until his death in 1915, and is honored with a monument by his grave in the churchyard at Tabernacle Baptist Church in downtown Beaufort. Again and again I found that my efforts to uncover the stories of this area were full of these contradictions -- on the one hand, monuments to a ruined history; on the other, inspiring stories of heroism and survival. Next Bill took the van down a sandy back road to Coffin Point, where we stopped at a small cemetery that has been maintained by the local community since the days of Reconstruction. Bill told me that he recently brought a woman who had traveled from California to trace her family history to the cemetery, and that she'd found the graves of several ancestors among the thick vines and palmetto scrub that grow along the heavy wrought-iron fences.

He said that local tradition mandated that visitors walk backward out of the cemetery to avoid bringing any bad spirits along with us. Though we laughed self-consciously, every one of his visitors obeyed. (The current caretaker of the cemetery feels that strangers walking in the cemetery is disrespectful, and has closed the site to visitors.) The highlight of the tour for me was a visit to the Coffin Point Praise House (57 Coffin Point Road), a white clapboard building, measuring 10 by 15 feet, which has served as a gathering place for the people of this community for more than a century. The praise house is tucked back in a grove of locusts and big pines, where squirrels chittering in the branches nearly drowned out the burr of a neighbor's lawn mower. Originally, praise houses were used as houses of worship for slaves. While Lowcountry planters built fine churches like the Chapel of Ease and Brick Baptist for themselves, enslaved people found ways to maintain gathering places like Coffin Point. The size of the structure was limited in order to prevent large groups from gathering in one place. White plantation owners feared the slaves might organize resistance. Bill had a key to Coffin Point and let us make our way through the narrow aisle to the altar, draped by a hand-sewn cloth, where two old-fashioned lamps bookend an open Bible. I took a seat on one of the white pews and tried to imagine the services that once took place here. Later I'd learn that the singing of spirituals and praise songs might have gone on for hours, ending with a counterclockwise dance known as a ""ring shout,"" or ""shout"" for short -- a spontaneous outlet of joy and enthusiasm for an enslaved people with few such opportunities.

After the tour, Bill put me in touch with Mary Rivers Legree, who maintains the praise house as president of the Coffin Point Community Association. Ms. Legree's family has lived on the same land on Coffin Point since the era of slavery. She was raised there until the age of 9, then moved north. Amid the horrors of the Jim Crow South , 78-year-old Ms. Legree recalled an isolated childhood with access to fresh seafood, tomatoes, corn, sweet potatoes, okra, and such exotic-sounding fare as pomegranates, persimmons, figs and turtle eggs, all grown on St. Helena Island. Even when Ms. Legree moved to New York City and later Michigan, she kept her connection to the Lowcountry, once asking her father to send a cooler of whiting by Express Mail so she could hold a fish fry for her Detroit neighbors. More important, she kept paying the property taxes on the land that had been in her family since 1866. ""I didn't know what it meant, but I sent the money,"" she told me as we sat on the wooden pews in the praise house, the door open to the sunny June morning. She understood the value of the land when, in 2005, she retired and moved back to St. Helena. After settling into her father's cottage on Coffin Point, Ms. Legree often passed the old praise house. Services had ceased with the deaths of elders, and the building was in poor condition. The doors had been left open, and no markers or plaques indicated the historical significance of the structure. Ms. Legree recalled saying to herself, ""This place needs somebody."" Despite renewed public interest in the area's history, Ms. Legree still worries that the strong sense of culture that has made St. Helena a cohesive community will be lost unless local residents fight harder to preserve it. ""Most of the Gullah people around here are between 60 and 80 years old,"" she said. ""The young people here don't understand the historical significance of being landowners. They don't even know how they got their land.""

My family and I spent the next morning on the beach, but at the end of the day I was charged with the task of visiting the Gay Fish Company (1948 Sea Island Parkway) for our daily ration of extra-large white shrimp. I took advantage of the opportunity to spend a few minutes with Charles Gay, who co-owns the business with his sister and brother. I'd caught glimpses of Mr. Gay over the years, along with other members of the family (a grandson frequently works the cash register), but I'd never spent more than a few minutes in the bustling front room, where coolers of shrimp, crab and local fish fill the air with the briny scent of a Lowcountry summer. Mr. Gay was raised on St. Helena, and still lives within walking distance of the business that has been in his family since the 1940s. He recalled a time when he knew exactly how many people lived on the island, and ""you could walk down the middle of the main road without worrying about getting hit."" Mr. Gay, who is white, grew up speaking Gullah, having learned it from his neighbors. Like Ms. Legree, he remembers St. Helena as a remote community, so safe that nobody ever locked their doors. But the Gays are also feeling the pressure of increased land prices, and -- perhaps more significantly -- climate change. Hurricane Matthew hit the Sea Islands hard in October 2016, destroying the docks at the Gay Fish Company. Mr. Gay and his siblings put the business up for sale in March 2017, but the business has remained open while they look for a buyer. Mr. Gay said that he'd like the new owners to keep the family name, but he didn't sound optimistic. ""People don't understand the history that's here,"" he said.

There are reasons for optimism. Penn Center is thriving, and the Reconstruction Era National Historical Park will draw new visitors to the area. The island is changing in other ways as well, with a yearly influx of migrant workers who come to work on the tomato farms. Latino grocery stores stocked with pan dulce and fresh chiles now dot the landscape along the Sea Island Highway, side by side with gas stations and produce stands. To all appearances, the area is flourishing. However, the threat of gentrification from rising land prices and climate change pose real challenges to the island's residents. As I drove home, I thought about the future of the Sea Islands, and my own role in that future. As a white visitor to a historically black community, I can't ignore the way that race has shaped and will continue to shape this landscape. I'm also well aware that white tourists like me are part of the forces of gentrification. I've made a personal pledge to support local organizations like the Penn Center and the Gullah Grub owners' Marshview Community Organic Farm, and to do whatever I can to advance the cause of environmental justice in this area. Climate change will hit the Lowcountry and its low-income residents hard, and my family has a part to play in ensuring that life here is sustainable. I hope that my children and my nephews will still find a refuge on the Sea Islands in the years to come, and that they'll take the time to seek out the hidden stories that are easy to miss when you're traveling 35 miles an hour.

51005,5 Tips for Saving on Holiday Air Travel,"When it comes to Thanksgiving and winter holiday travel, book early (the day you fly matters, too).",Travelers should have Thanksgiving plans sorted out by Halloween.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/23/travel/UPDATE/UPDATE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=aea8280314b83e97b5440f3a4503d4f2089812a0c822cea76b76d7d1c63eea6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/travel/5-tips-for-saving-on-holiday-air-travel.html,77d39702-e191-5e57-aa77-f7f25c914d3b.jpg,"When it comes to holiday travel, it is generally true that the earlier you book, the better -- though there are several factors at play. ""One of the problems is that everybody looks for a rule of thumb, and it is different depending on the market you are traveling,"" said Patrick Surry, the chief data scientist at Hopper, a website and app that advises travelers when to book flights. But timing really can be everything when it comes to locking up the best holiday airfares. Here are five guidelines to follow if you want more money to spend on presents this winter. You Can Wait, but Not Too Long A survey by the travel search company Skyscanner found that 39 percent of holiday travelers say they prefer to book four to six weeks ahead of departure, with the rest choosing to book months, if not one full year, in advance.

If you're in that group that has procrastinating in its blood, you still have some time before things really get out of hand. ""The prices start off pretty high, because people tend to have limited flexibility when it comes to Thanksgiving,"" Mr. Surry said. ""But they stay flat up until probably three weeks out, when they start to ramp up, and in the last 10 days they really spike."" Last year, the lowest ticket prices for Thanksgiving week were available about 60 to 70 days ahead of departure, or late September, according to data analyzed by Hopper. If you book between now and the end of October, you'll likely spend around $325 for an average domestic flight, according to Hopper. Waiting until November will cost about $58 more a ticket, according to analysis by CheapAir.com. Hopper puts it at about $1.50 per day during the first weeks of November; $6 per day 10 days out from Thanksgiving. Sticking with the holiday theme, Mr. Surry said Halloween is a good marker for when you should have your Thanksgiving travel plans sorted out.

Thanksgiving week is also a good guidepost for when to have your Christmas travel plans settled, though Hopper said booking in early October will give you the best rates. Skyscanner predicts that, based on its 2015 data, booking Thanksgiving week could offer savings of 6.41 percent compared with rates available after. The Day of the Week Matters Most people would love not to travel on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving just to avoid the crowds, but it's also one of the most expensive days to fly, along with the Saturday before and the Sunday after, Mr. Surry said. According to CheapAir.com, the Friday after Thanksgiving is not just good for retailers. Along with the following Tuesday, it's the cheapest return day. Hopper said flying on any day that week but Wednesday will be about 20 percent cheaper. If you're just looking to get away, the more options you consider, the better rate you may find. ""I think people have a lot more flexibility when it comes to when they're going to travel and where they're going to travel,"" Mr. Surry said of Christmastime travel. ""You know you're all not necessarily going home for that holiday."" According to Hopper, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Year's Eve are the cheapest days to fly for the winter holidays. Departing on Tuesday, Dec. 20, and returning Thursday, Jan. 5, is the next best bet. Flexibility will also put Cyber Monday into play. Hopper said great deals were spotted last year in the week following Thanksgiving, ""if you're willing to travel at sort of strange times,"" Mr. Surry added.

As the third round begins at the French Open, we've seen plenty of upsets as players acclimate to the untraditional conditions of Paris in October instead of May and June. But a few stalwart favorites remain unperturbed by the light rain and the balls' unusually low bounces. Simona Halep, Dominic Thiem and Rafael Nadal will all be featured on the main stage, Court Philippe Chatrier, but more interesting matches can be found on some of the smaller courts, if you know where to look.

Here are some matches to keep an eye on.

Because of the number of matches cycling through courts, the times for individual matchups are at best a guess and are certain to fluctuate based on the times at which earlier play is completed. All times are Eastern.

Halep, the top seed, has won her last 16 matches, collecting three titles along the way. She has looked especially dominant on clay, winning the Italian Open without dropping a set. Now, back on the Grand Slam stage, Halep looks capable of winning her second French Open title.

Anisimova, the 25th seed, reached the semifinals of last year's French Open, losing to the eventual champion, Ashleigh Barty, in three sets. In the quarterfinals, she had defeated Halep in two sets, in their only meeting. Anisimova primarily plays from the baseline with flattened shots, not presenting herself as a clay-court specialist. But because her opponents' serves slow down and bounce up to a good height for striking, her excellent returns are more effective on clay."

Sebastian, my oldest child, has grown up reading fantasy novels and watching ""Lord of the Rings,"" so he knows every inch of Frodo and Sam's journey, from the Dead Marshes to Mount Doom. So this is how I sold it: We were going to Mordor. We would be crossing snowy mountain passes, black sand deserts, raging rivers and hot, acidic mud pits. It would be a fantastic adventure, with a small chance of death. Naturally, my wife bristled at the mention of mortality. ""This wouldn't happen,"" I assured her (repeatedly), but its ever-so-faint possibility was crucial to the magic of the endeavor. We weren't playing on the Xbox. This was real. We were headed to the remote, volcanic highlands of Iceland -- and together we would live to tell the story. Salesmanship. It's a vastly underappreciated facet of parenting. It was, of course, something of a conceit. I like hiking and acidic mud pits as much as the next man, but what I really wanted was time with my son. For months, I had been sensing that he was at a precarious age -- no longer child, but not quite teenager -- and I could feel the steady tug of adolescence, like gravity, pulling him away from me. All of it was quite age-appropriate. (How was your day? ""Good."" What do you talk about with your buddies? ""Dunno."") I wanted more, but there always seemed to be homework, soccer games, track meets, sleepovers, band practice, you name it -- it's insane really, the number of obligations that we cram into our children's lives until we're all collectively exhausted.

Sebastian and I exited the bus and did a quick equipment check -- boots, waterproof pants, jackets, hats, gloves, packs, deck of cards, freeze-dried meals and enough Snickers bars to resuscitate six diabetics from hypoglycemia. In the warden's hut, where prospective hikers check in, the warden eyed me appraisingly. ""Weather at the pass is not great,"" he warned. ""Visibility is poor."" He then asked about our gear. The moment had the somber feeling of a border crossing, as if we were on the cusp of entering a foreign land, which, in fact, we were. All of this, by the way, is typical at the start of the Laugavegur Trail; and wardens often turn people away. The trail was well marked, the warden explained, with poles every hundred yards or so. And there were plenty of other hikers. The only dicey area was the first mountain pass, just before the hut at Hrafntinnusker, where we would spend our first night. Snow and fog sometimes obscured visibility here. ""You can always turn around or dial 112 on your cellphone in an emergency,"" he said. I hesitated. Several years back, a young Israeli died on this very pass, in a freak summer blizzard; and he wasn't the only one to perish. ""We usually have one death every two years,"" another warden said. ""We'll take it one kilometer at a time,"" I told myself. At the trailhead, I tried to take some weight off Sebastian's pack. He had won the state champion in the 1,500-meter for his age group, but running on a track and shouldering a pack over mountains are different tasks entirely. Sebastian gently pushed me away. ""Don't think of us as father and son, just as extremely good friends, and equals,"" he said. The expression on his face was so proud and earnest that I had no choice but to agree. And so we began our ascent to Hrafntinnusker. We climbed up a series of gentle slopes through a vaguely lunar landscape. (It was readily apparent why, in 1960s, astronauts trained in Iceland for their visit to the moon.) We soon gazed down into Vondugil, the so-called Wicked Valley -- a place that shepherds historically avoided because of its evil spirits -- and which seemed aptly named, as it lay shrouded in a gloomy mist. Sebastian was electrified by it all. When we saw puffs of vapor, in the distance, he bounded up the mountain until we discovered a blowhole where steam hissed. Moments later, he yelled: ""Look Dad, look!"" I was doubtful about what could warrant such exuberance, until I turned and saw a pond bubbling to a boil. As we neared the mountain pass, the rocky terrain vanished, giving way to snow and ice. We could have been in Antarctica. The trail was marked with tall stone cairns, which flickered in and out of view, as low-lying clouds swept over us. Instinctively, we reached out and held hands. I felt Sebastian squeeze my fingers. I looked over at him -- to make sure he was all right. His eyes were gleaming with determination.

It was Sebastian who spotted the memorial for the young Israeli -- Ido Keinan -- a modest pile of stones with a metal plaque. The frightening part was just how close Keinan was to safety when he died. Just a few hundred yards later we reached the Hrafntinnusker hut. The two wardens who maintained it -- a young British couple, Katie Featherstone and Daniel de Maine -- welcomed us. It was not fancy -- a few spartanly furnished rooms and a kitchen -- but it was warm, safe and dry. As afternoon turned into evening, the weather steadily worsened. The wind intensified, visibility dropped and the air grew colder. Other hikers arrived, including a large contingent from South Korea, filling the small house to capacity: 52 people unfurled their sleeping bags in every nook and cranny. (Spaces at these huts are hard to come by; typically, reservations must be made months in advance.) Outside, a handful of brave souls pitched tents. Around 8:30 p.m., three young women from California arrived. They were cold, wet and spooked. They did not have reservations and they hadn't checked in with the warden at Landmannalaugar. Katie told them, gently but firmly, that there was no room; they'd have to pitch their tent and make it through the night. If the situation turned dire, Katie said she would open the doors. It was a challenging situation, but one that she and Daniel were up to. Before coming to Iceland, they had volunteered at a refugee camp in Calais, France. ""There was a lot of saying 'no' to people in France -- people in considerably worse situations,"" Daniel recalled with regret.

As we began our descent into the valley, whose slopes were covered with electric green moss, it felt as if we had emerged from the moon, and then the arctic, only to find ourselves in the glens of Scotland. Sebastian didn't complain, but I could see that he was cold. When we reached the river, the water came up past our knees, and we had no choice but to take off our boots and cross in hiking sandals. The water, which was snowmelt, numbed our feet; when we reached the far bank, Sebastian was shivering. I knelt down, put his socks back on, and tied his boots -- like I once did when he was a small child. ""Dad,"" he said in a quiet voice. ""I love you.""

We shouldered our packs and, as quickly as we could, completed the last leg of the journey, across the valley, to Alftavatn. Here we found our hut and the trail's legendary bar in an adjoining shack. We were the first hikers to arrive and had the bar to ourselves. It was a cramped, cozy space with the scent of chicken stew in the air and a guitar on the wall for patrons to play. Sebastian inhaled a brownie, and I downed a beer, while the two barkeeps -- Maria and Anton, a young Bulgarian couple -- talked about why they had chosen to live in Iceland. ""It's a magical place that has a special energy,"" Anton explained. ""They say whatever you wish for, can happen there ... If you ask for cheese ..."" ""You can find it ...,"" Anton said. "" ... Even without going to the shop,"" finished Maria. There was a trippy ""Alice in Wonderland"" quality to their words, but in our state of considerable fatigue, it seemed appropriately dreamy. I asked Anton about a gold medal, mounted on the wall, with the inscription: DIDN'T MURDER ANYONE TODAY. ""Ah, yes ... We didn't understand that when we first came here,"" he said, with a wry smile. ""But now, after seeing so many panicked people, we understand. When you are in survival mode, you forget manners."" This had been the case the previous week, when severe winds necessitated an emergency evacuation of roughly 100 campers from Alftavatn. An hour or so later, the weather cleared. Entirely. Wind died. Rain stopped. Clouds parted. And then rich, golden sunshine poured from the heavens, while every last beleaguered hiker posted the same image to Instagram: #IcelandicGodbeam and #PraisedBeJesus. Our surroundings, which we could only now grasp for the first time, were jaw-dropping: green hills, snow-capped peaks and the lake itself -- utterly still -- a black, Tahitian pearl embedded in the earth. That evening, in the hut, the South Korea hikers invited us to join them for a raucous dinner of fish, kimchi and vodka. Everyone toasted Sebastian for his stamina and he delighted in the attention.

The next morning, Sebastian and I set off across a sprawling, black-sand desert, hemmed in by mountains and glaciers. The weather was perfect -- sunny with a slight chill in the air -- and we chatted as we walked. ""Dad, tell me your life story,"" he said. He wasn't joking, so I obliged him and did my best not to sugarcoat it -- as if, in his words, we were just ""extremely good friends."" I told him about growing up, and working crummy jobs, and where I was on Sept. 11, and why my parents got divorced, and how I fell in love with his mother. And he talked, too. He recalled memories from the age of 5, when we lived in India, and he walked to school past ramshackle homes and yards with red-eyed rabbits. After the trials of the previous day, we savored the conversation. The sun got stronger, necessitating us to look for our sunscreen, which I could not find. Sebastian grabbed my cellphone and, to my amazement, used FaceTime for an impromptu videoconference with my wife in Connecticut. ""It's in that little side pocket in Sebastian's pack,"" she said. ""Now hold up the camera, so I can make sure Dad puts it on properly."" Alas, our male bonding was briefly interrupted and sunburns were avoided. We spent that night at the mountain outpost of Emstrur and, the following day, finished the trail to its end in Thorsmork. The weather remained perfect and we talked a great deal more, even as the bus carried us back to civilization -- to the tidy streets of Reykjavik. On our last night in Iceland, we feasted on sushi, and then returned to the hotel. We had adjacent twin beds. Sebastian dozed off immediately and then rolled over, in his sleep, so he was snuggled close, with his gangly arms draped over me. It was late by then, almost 10 o'clock, but the sky was still awash in light -- the slow burn of northern twilight. Soon our busy lives would resume. School would start. Days would pass. My son would grow up. But for now, I cheated time, and dusk lingered. Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

But that didn't happen. And there is nothing about the new Tundra to suggest that Detroit needs to start worrying now.

For 2014 the Tundra has received its first extensive revamping since the 2007 model year.

This was expected to be a significant upgrade of Toyota's big truck, girded for battle against new competition from Ram and General Motors. But all three engines (a 4-liter V6, a 4.6-liter V8 and a 5.7 liter V8) are carried over, and even a news release couldn't bolster the enthusiasm to say more than that they are ""among the segment's most capable.""

The frame is also carried over, and Toyota talks about ""suspension enhancements"" rather than a new design.

What has changed is the look, which Toyota describes as ""more chiseled and robust,"" including a new grille with a proliferation of thick chrome bars. The interiors are new, and there is now a top-of-the-line ""1794"" edition that tries -- with some success -- to blend cowboy style with English leather appointments.

His approach -- emphasizing lower tariffs, accurate economic data, trade pacts and the freer flow of capital -- was largely aimed at coaxing foreign investment back to Argentina and ending the economic exile that followed the country's default in 2001. But over the last week, Argentina has been reminded that when capital is free to flow in, it can also flow out, creating profound economic implications. With foreign investors pulling their money en masse, Argentina's central bank was forced to take drastic action to stabilize the country's currency. On Friday, policymakers lifted the benchmark interest rate to 40 percent after days of intervening heavily in financial markets.

While it helped settle the markets, the move will weigh on the prospects for the president's ambitious economic overhaul. It also has the potential to crimp growth, adding to political discontent. The rate increase, a day after the Argentine peso fell 8.5 percent against the dollar, was the third in a week. The central bank said it would use ""all the tools at its disposal"" to slow inflation, which in March was up 25 percent from a year earlier, to 15 percent this year, a goal most analysts now see as unrealistic. In parallel, officials announced that they would cut government spending, and reduce the primary budget deficit to 2.7 percent, from the earlier goal of 3.2 percent. Their decision was seen as a response to criticism from investors that Mr. Macri's government had not been cutting spending quickly enough. Mr. Macri was sworn into office in December 2015. Argentina had been closed to international markets for more than a decade amid a long-running legal fight with bondholders that followed a default on its debt. Early on, Mr. Macri's policies were greeted with widespread optimism by financial markets, which gobbled up the country's newly issued bonds.

In a show of market confidence, prices for the country's government bonds rose, pushing interest rates lower. Those lower rates helped to stimulate economic growth. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. ""There was overconfidence on the part of policymakers about how much could be done given the constraints they had,"" said Alvaro Vivanco, a strategist covering Latin American bond and currency markets for the Spanish bank BBVA. But doubts about the government's ability to quickly push through the changes have emerged in recent months. In January, Argentina's central bank cut interest rates and increased its inflation target, a decision interpreted by some as weakening the government's commitment to getting consumer prices under control. ""The central bank was cutting, with inflation expectations deteriorating,"" said Gabriel Gersztein, head of Latin American strategy at BNP Paribas. ""And this was a wake-up call for international investors."" The global economic backdrop has also been changing. With the United States economy on solid footing, its short-term interest rates have been rising. That has put upward pressure on the United States dollar, and has resulted in a slide for the peso. That decline in the peso has accelerated in recent days, as foreign investors began to see their returns vaporized by the falling currency. People moved to the exits, in part because of a new income tax on foreign investors. As more and more investors pulled out, Argentina was suddenly facing a currency run. Argentine officials have struggled to shore up the currency. Since March, Argentina has spent more than $7.7 billion of its international reserves, with the pace speeding up late last week.

Governments have a few tools they can use to stem the outflow of capital. One of them is to sharply raise interest rates. Those higher rates translate into potentially stronger returns for investors. As such, they can attract money into an economy, which helps prop up a currency. But it's a tricky play to pull off. Brazil raised interest rates sharply to stop an outflow of capital in the late 1990s, ultimately pushing benchmark interest rates to roughly 40 percent. More recently, in 2014, Turkey suddenly ratcheted up a key central bank rate to 10 percent from 4.5 percent in order to stop a sell-off in the lira. That same year, the central bank of Russia pushed interest rates sharply higher -- to 17 percent from 10.5 percent -- to keep the ruble from collapsing in response to sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and a sharp drop in oil prices. Russia also has one of the biggest interest-rate jumps on record, when in 1998 its rates reached 150 percent in an effort to stem another impending collapse of the ruble. But high interest rates have economic costs. They make it particularly difficult for businesses and consumer to borrow money. The lack of spending, in turn, can slow growth and ultimately spark a recession. The key for Argentina will be to keep rates high just long enough to inspire confidence that policymakers have halted the currency run, but not so long that the increase drains the economy. ""This was done in order to stop the bleeding,"" Mr. Gersztein of BNP Paribas said. ""It's like you have someone in the E.R. You need to take very short-term, bold decisions. ""Then once you stabilize the patient,"" he added, ""you need to take different decisions in order to make the patient get better and recover.""

Politically, it all puts Mr. Macri in a more precarious position. In recent months, his popularity has declined. In an April poll of Argentines by Synopsis, a local consultancy, 43 percent said they had a negative view of the government, compared with 34 percent with a positive view. That was a sharp shift from November, when nearly 52 percent said they had a positive image of the government and Mr. Macri's allies did better than expected in midterm elections. The president is now balancing the concerns of a restive population and the needs of international investors -- and they don't necessarily want the same thing. International investors want assurance that Mr. Macri will continue to cut spending and stick with other parts of his plan. But those same efforts are frustrating certain constituencies at home. Unions are worried that workers are losing purchasing power amid high inflation and a broad increase in public utility rates, part of the government's efforts to decrease spending by slashing subsidies. Hundreds gathered on Friday in downtown Buenos Aires outside the National Electricity Regulator for a union protest against recent increases in utility prices. Last month, thousands took to the streets to protest the hikes. The higher utility costs are hitting the manufacturing sector hard, particularly companies that compete against imported goods. Ancers, a tableware manufacturer in Buenos Aires, has seen its gas bill soar by 48 percent while electricity costs have doubled since the beginning of last year. During that time, the number of employees has declined by 25 percent, said Angel Vazquez, the company's founder and president. ""We may very well have to close soon,"" Mr. Vazquez said. ""I don't know if we can hold out for another year.""

What happens next with the economy may translate into whether Mr. Macri's coalition will win the presidential election next year or whether discontent will give rise to an interventionist government that will undo many of his changes. Although the economy as a whole is growing -- expanding 5.1 percent in February, on the year -- the latest measures are prompting some analysts to revise their forecasts downward. ""The government so far has not been able to show big victories, and it's obvious that if it is going to take unpopular measures, its popularity will suffer,"" said Fausto Spotorno, the chief economist at Orlando Ferreres & Asociados, a local consultancy. ""But it has rushed many of the measures so that it can avoid bad news next year."""

They hope that the technique will help in the treatment of diseases, such as osteoarthritis and muscle wasting, that are caused by the aging of tissue cells.

A major cause of aging is thought to be the errors that accumulate in the epigenome, the system of proteins that packages the DNA and controls access to its genes. The Stanford team, led by Tapash Jay Sarkar, Dr. Thomas A. Rando and Vittorio Sebastiano, say their method, designed to reverse these errors and walk back the cells to their youthful state, does indeed restore the cells' vigor and eliminate signs of aging.

In their report, published on Tuesday in Nature Communications, they described their technique as ""a significant step toward the goal of reversing cellular aging"" and could produce therapies ""for aging and aging-related diseases.""

Leonard P. Guarente, an expert on aging at M.I.T., said the method was ""one of the most promising areas of aging research"" but that it would take a long time to develop drugs based on RNA, the required chemical."
56088,"Video: The BMW 435i Is a Ray of Sunshine, for a Price","It may cost as much as two Mazda Miatas, but BMW's 4 Series convertible offers BMW precision to the open-air crowd.",The 2015 BMW 435i Convertible.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/09/automobiles/09DRIVEN-image/09DRIVEN-image-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=302&w=600&s=708df28fc0b77f9a4fe9d5f3714a8abf91d83cc83fdfe8bcc3647a30c7d8df82&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/automobiles/video-the-bmw-435i-is-a-ray-of-sunshine-for-a-price.html,78bbc44c-8e78-59ea-9478-d9c1129a3e25.jpg,"During photography of the 2015 BMW 435i convertible, I shot beautiful video of flowers, clouds, horses and scenic vistas along rural roads. Almost none of it is used in the piece. This is, after all, a car review, not a CBS Sunday Morning sound and picture piece. But, as a convertible owner myself, I'm compelled to communicate what I see and smell when the top is down. It's not only about getting a deeper tan (something doctors will frown upon anyway).

As convertibles go, the 435i is quite nice, and for the price of two well-equipped Miatas, it should be. The Luxury model I drove was optioned up to the cost of $64,800. The 300-horsepower 3-liter in-line 6-cylinder engine, with twin scroll turbocharging, danced flawlessly with its 8-speed automatic transmission partner. The hardtop mechanism hypnotized anybody who saw its precise movements.

The convertible isn't as lithe in the corners as the 4 Series coupe. Added weight (and a readjustment of it) takes the edge off the fun for hard-charging pilots who must drive the car to its limits. Owners slinging though turns using 90 percent of the 4 Series' ability will be quite satisfied if they manage to keep their licenses.

She was standing in the kitchen of her Long Island restaurant, the North Fork Table. It was an absurd statement. Ms. Fleming, 60, has been making this tart since the 20th century. She created it for Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan, where she was the pastry chef for nearly a decade; tinkered with it there as it became her salty-sweet signature; and published the recipe in her 2001 cookbook, ""The Last Course."" A cult classic among pastry chefs, the original edition has become a precious rarity; copies that occasionally pop up on eBay sell for as much as $200. The book is finally being reissued this month , at the same time that Ms. Fleming is closing a difficult chapter that culminated in the death of her husband, the chef Gerry Hayden, in 2015.

There are only three elements, none revolutionary . It is a chocolate crust lined with soft caramel and filled with chocolate ganache. Any good chef would ask: Are these perfect together? But Ms. Fleming asks: Are they perfect in relation to each other? Precisely how much salt is needed in the crust to backstop the caramel? Does it need to have corners, so that some bites are crunchier than others, or should it be round, which will make for a oozier center bite? How many millimeters of caramel best complements how many millimeters of chocolate? Cooking skills are easy enough to learn. But to carve a path, like Ms. Fleming, a chef needs two things that cannot be taught: a great palate and a deranged sense of perfectionism.

""I thought I was buying into it, but I wasn't,"" she said, referring to the punishing ethos of traditional ballet. ""And my mother wouldn't have stood for it."" Pushing through the endless repetition of steps and the pain of dancing on point , she said, was probably good training for a restaurant kitchen. She switched to modern dance, moved to New York City and gave herself a deadline of age 25 to make it as a professional dancer. In the meantime, she supported herself by working in restaurants. Her first job in high school was scooping ice cream at a Friendly's at the South Shore mall . ""I loved it so much,"" she said dreamily. ""I love ice cream more than anything. I loved the fast pace, the organizing, the physical challenge."" She started at Jams, which the young chef Jonathan Waxman opened in 1984 to introduce Manhattanites to the new ""California cuisine."" The chefs Alice Waters, Evan Kleiman and Judy Rodgers were already running influential kitchens on the West Coast, and most of the line cooks Mr. Waxman had recruited were women. Ms. Fleming said it drew her toward the kitchen. In New York, she said, ""That was literally unheard-of at the time."" She waited tables at Union Square Cafe, where the owner Danny Meyer said he hired her before she sat down for an interview . ""Even from half a room away, I could feel her warmth, poise , and intelligence,"" he wrote in the preface to ""The Last Course."" She moved into the kitchen there as a line cook, and was hired away by Drew Nieporent as a pastry assistant when Tribeca Grill opened in 1990. ""Once I tried pastry, that was it for me,"" she said. ""I was hooked."" At the time, American pastry chefs were quite literally reaching new heights. Desserts were being reinterpreted, deconstructed and reconstructed on tall scaffoldings made of spun sugar, airy mousses and puff pastry. After decades of French standards like chocolate mousse and creme caramel, the simultaneous arrival of nouvelle cuisine and global express shipping brought new playthings to American restaurant kitchens, like white and dark chocolate , macadamia nuts and mangoes, kiwi fruit and coconut milk . Ms. Fleming dived into exploration, but only dabbled in construction. ""I wasn't very interested in Legos,"" she said. ""I wanted it to taste like something.""

She gave up on dancing and pursued a new dream: to immerse herself in the tradition of French pastry in Paris . ""At the time, my money would last longer there than in L.A .,"" she said; her other idea was to go deep on bread at Nancy Silverton's groundbreaking La Brea Bakery. With help from the New York baker Maury Rubin (""I nagged him for two years to get me in""), she apprenticed at the celebrated, century-old Patisserie Rousseau et Seurre, then at the influential emporium Fauchon, learning mostly by observation.

""I was sometimes allowed to cut the dough, but never to make the dough,"" she said. ""Maybe they would let me dip the eclairs if someone didn't show up for work."" After she returned to New York, Ms. Fleming checked in with Mr. Meyer, who was about to open his luxurious, gloriously American restaurant Gramercy Tavern with the young chef Tom Colicchio in charge of the kitchen. ""It was not love at first sight: I was extremely intimidated,"" she said. Mr. Colicchio had worked in pastry himself, and she had a long resume but little hands-on experience. ""I was in so far over my head."" Fortunately, she said, at first he just told her what desserts to make. When she got her bearings, Gramercy Tavern had become a destination restaurant, and she felt ready to invent desserts that were not only as multidimensional as the rest of the menu, but also as intensely flavored and respectful of ingredients.

""The book is a legend,"" said Matt Sartwell, an owner of the Manhattan cookbook store Kitchen Arts and Letters, calling the new printing a ""godsend."" ""So many people have read or heard something about it that lights a fire under them."" At North Fork Table, Mr. Hayden and Ms. Fleming built networks with farmers and fishermen, and pulled together a food community around the inn's tiny kitchen. But the work of running it, along with innkeeping, was overwhelming from the start, she said. In 2011, Mr. Hayden received a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (A.L.S., or Lou Gehrig's disease), and she cared for him until he died four years later. Only now, she said, has she begun emerging from those dark years. She is planning to s ell the inn, moving back to New York City, and searching the menus of her culinary descendants for clues to her next act in pastry. Will it include black sesame? Boba? Burned sage? ""I'll think of something new,"" she said."

POETRY AND PARTITION: THE FILMS OF RITWIK GHATAK at Film at Lincoln Center (Nov. 1-6). Although the movies of the Indian director Satyajit Ray (""Pather Panchali"") are part of the global-cinephile canon, the eight films of his contemporary Ghatak -- whom Ray felt was underrecognized -- are seldom screened here. A Bengali intellectual whose films addressed, in ways both personal and abstract, themes of poverty and identity in the wake of India's partition, Ghatak was gently experimental in his low angles and use of sound. His reputed masterpiece, ""The Cloud-Capped Star"" (on Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday), tells the story of a family that abuses the generosity of one sister (Supriya Choudhury), who sacrifices her own happiness while her brother chases his dreams of musical stardom and a would-be husband pursues his studies. Ghatak plays a version of himself in ""Reason, Debate and a Tale"" (on Saturday and Wednesday), released after his death.

'SCOPE DOCS: THE WILD WORLD IN WIDESCREEN at the Museum of the Moving Image (Nov. 1-3). For anyone who associates documentaries with televisual blandness, the films here argue otherwise. The director Jason Kohn has selected nonfiction films that make expressive use of a wide-screen aspect ratio, including his own debut feature, ""Manda Bala (Send a Bullet)"" (on Sunday), a daisy-chain examination of class disparities and the economics of crime and corruption in Brazil. Kohn will introduce the screenings, which kick off on Friday with ""Tokyo Olympiad,"" Kon Ichikawa's chronicle of the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo, and continue the next day with rarely screened documentaries by Vittorio de Seta, who captured traditional pre-industrial practices in Italy.

60465,A Threat to the Job Security of White-Glove Chauffeurs,The Bentley Mulsanne's surprisingly able handling and top speed of 184 miles per hour make it the rare ultraluxury car that encourages you to drop the Champagne flute and grab the reins.,"OUTSIZED The Bentley Mulsanne is enormous and weighs about three tons, but still manages 0-60 in 5.1 seconds.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/02/automobiles/02WHEE/02WHEE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=293&w=600&s=1c380a4c89dac4559e2c940300e80fe77a0cca4cc609458e000ad7ce0d845918&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/automobiles/autoreviews/a-threat-to-the-job-security-of-chauffeurs.html,4e47f92e-a0d2-5a2b-9483-861014304ee4.jpg,"THE Bentley Mulsanne, it turns out, is a pleasant car to drive. I can hear the snorts already: ""Excuse me? Bentley's flagship costs $330,000. I should hope it's pleasing."" Yet there's a reason the movie wasn't called ""Drive, Miss Daisy"": movable penthouses like the Bentley are usually best experienced from the back seat. The idea is to leave the driving to the guy in the funny cap while the owner peruses his Davos itinerary. In the fragrant bellies of these behemoths, the world outside is silenced and the ride is like clotted cream. But again, the word is ""ride,"" not ""drive."" Traditionally, the indentured pilot feels as disengaged from the road as his boss. While this new Bentley would still seem misplaced on the Mulsanne for which it is named -- the straightaway on the Le Mans racing circuit -- its surprisingly able handling and top speed of 184 miles per hour make it the rare ultraluxury chariot that encourages you to drop the Champagne flute and grab the reins.

The Mulsanne is an enormous car, weighing almost 6,000 pounds and measuring nearly 220 inches in length, some seven inches more than the aging Arnage it replaces. That's more than a foot longer and roughly 1,500 pounds heavier than a Mercedes-Benz S-Class. The Bentley manages to look richly imposing, yet tasteful, avoiding the chromed-Panzer strut of the Rolls-Royce Phantom and the soulless-limo look of the Mercedes Maybach. Crisply tailored shoulders and flowing haunches evoke Bentley S-Types of the '50s. Those creases and curves rely on a range of costly techniques including superforming, which allows a single sheet of superheated aluminum to be molded by pressurized air into complex, three-dimensional shapes. Rear fenders envelop the striking ""floating ellipse"" taillamps with no unsightly cut lines around the lamps. Hand-finished stainless steel provides gleaming contrast on the mesh grille, door sills and other components. The retractable Flying B ""radiator mascot"" is a $2,550 option. In that vein, if a buyer isn't satisfied with 115 standard paint shades, 24 leather colors and a magic forest's worth of woods, many whims can be met through the Mulliner bespoke-ordering program. Customers have previously requested colors matched to a favorite nail polish and even a turquoise kitchen mixer. The company occasionally draws the line: Bentley says it has politely refused eccentrics who asked for quick-release shotgun holders, a solid-gold radiator shell or a microwave oven.

Whereas even a typical mass-produced luxury model can be finished in about 24 hours, it takes nine weeks to build a Mulsanne at the factory in Crewe, England: 170 hours alone to assemble the interior, including 15 hours to hand-stitch the steering wheel. Workers inspect the leather for insect bites and other blemishes; 17 hides are required to outfit the cabin, including a single sheet for the enormous headliner. Wood from three-foot-thick, 80-year-old root balls is shaved into thin veneers and applied atop five sturdy layers of tulip-poplar wood -- not simply stuck atop an aluminum substrate -- and mirror-matched so the grain pattern on the left perfectly mirrors the one on the right. The lumber-loving detail plays to great effect in the Mulsanne's waistrail, an unbroken band of wood that encircles passengers front to back. I drove a pair of Mulsannes, a primed-for-South Beach model with piano black wood and (my preference) a blue-black model stuffed with burl oak, including fold-down ""picnic tables"" in the back and saddle-leather seats with contrasting blue piping. The Mulsanne's ergonomics benefit from a version of Audi's Multi Media Interface, a welcome improvement over the wretched Volkswagen-derived navigation screen that scarred the first-generation Continental GT coupe.

And while Audi's Bang & Olufsen audio system is tremendous, Bentley tops it with a 2,000-watt 20-speaker Naim unit ($7,415 extra) that's simply the best I've experienced in an automobile. It's certainly the most powerful factory audio in history. Clearly, you could bask in the Bentley without leaving the cobblestone driveway. Yet the Mulsanne is more than a Hogwarts library that levitates on command. What Bentley calls its first ground-up design in more than 80 years -- neither a modified Rolls-Royce nor a VW-based car like the Continental GT -- keeps its traditional engine size of 6.75 liters. With twin turbochargers, the V-8's 505 horsepower urge the Mulsanne to 60 m.p.h. in just 5.1 seconds. The engine's torque has reached biblical proportions: 752 pound-feet fully available at just 1,750 r.p.m. Mated to Audi's new ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, the engine peaks at a diesel-like 4,500 r.p.m., meeting Bentley's goal of ""unstressed"" performance. Even as the Bentley does its bullet-train act, passengers hear only a distant rumble, as relaxing as the sound of thunder from three counties away. The Mulsanne covers ground like a fairy-tale giant, quicker and nimbler than you expect. You feel its prodigious momentum, yet there's no clumsiness; an adjustable air suspension keeps the car flat and poised through curves. The car might seem unstoppable, but huge brakes halt this dreadnought in surprisingly short order. Road imperfections, noise and vibration are washed clean away, yet the driver-selectable steering communicates just enough to instill confidence. At night in the pitch-black Catskills, on narrow and devilishly winding lanes, the Mulsanne seemed to beg, ""Is that all you've got, mate?""

The engine can also switch seamlessly to 4-cylinder operation to save fuel, though that might be a Pyrrhic victory: the E.P.A. rating of 11 miles per gallon in town and 18 on the highway draws a $3,700 guzzler tax. The oddest thing about the Mulsanne is its econocar-size trunk, just 11 cubic feet. Chief executives must travel light. Reality rudely interrupted when I walked out one morning to find the front end slumped atop the huge 21-inch wheels. The air suspension had deflated; the car was towed away, quite demeaningly I thought, on a greasy flatbed. A loose clamp proved the culprit. Spaciousness aside, whatever the Mulsanne does on the road, a 12-cylinder Mercedes, Audi or BMW does as well at half the price. Executives admit that the brand's exclusivity, history and obsessive luxury help to convince customers that a Bentley is worth the price. They don't have to convince many. Bentley will build just 700 to 800 Mulsannes a year for the world market, roughly 200 for Americans, starting at $291,295. With options, my Mulsanne test cars reached a respective $324,840 and $333,885. Some commentators suggest that the Mulsanne is handicapped in the world-domination race because it's roughly $90,000 cheaper than the Phantom. (But about $50,000 more than the new Rolls-Royce Ghost.) On the contrary, the Mulsanne reveals Rolls's emperor as nakedly overpriced for what it delivers. The Mulsanne isn't as spacious as the Phantom, but it is less fusty over all. Ultimately, even these stratospheric sedans must be judged on how well they drive. In appealing contrast to the one-note Phantom and Maybach, a driver might take the Mulsanne for a fast spin without coming off as that social-climbing cliche: the man who could afford the car, but not the chauffeur.

56179,"Generation Later, Poor Are Still Rare at Elite Colleges",Surveys of top colleges found virtually no change from the 1990s to 2012 in enrollment of students who are less well off despite a huge increase in the number of such students going to college.,"Troy Simon, 21, said two nonprofit groups played an essential role in his journey from a chaotic childhood to Bard College.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/26/us/JPCOLLEGES1/JPCOLLEGES1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=122cfb8d49b3e07a0d58043dc1dad9cfab7ec0594495978c335baa05a00672bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/education/despite-promises-little-progress-in-drawing-poor-to-elite-colleges.html,f6c0f304-2ff9-5a4a-8d87-bc4d68c0b03f.jpg,"As the shaded quadrangles of the nation's elite campuses stir to life for the start of the academic year, they remain bastions of privilege. Amid promises to admit more poor students, top colleges educate roughly the same percentage of them as they did a generation ago. This is despite the fact that there are many high school seniors from low-income homes with top grades and scores: twice the percentage in the general population as at elite colleges. A series of federal surveys of selective colleges found virtually no change from the 1990s to 2012 in enrollment of students who are less well off -- less than 15 percent by some measures -- even though there was a huge increase over that time in the number of such students going to college. Similar studies looking at a narrower range of top wealthy universities back those findings. With race-based affirmative action losing both judicial and public support, many have urged selective colleges to shift more focus to economic diversity. This is partly because students are more likely to graduate and become leaders in their fields if they attend competitive colleges. Getting low-income students onto elite campuses is seen as a vital engine of social mobility. Yet as Anthony P. Carnevale, director of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce, put it, ""Higher education has become a powerful force for reinforcing advantage and passing it on through generations.""

It is true that low-income enrollment at some top colleges has been slowly climbing. And some studies suggest that colleges are well intentioned but simply ineffectual in addressing economic diversity. College leaders also point to studies showing that most low-income students with high grades and test scores do not apply to highly selective colleges. But critics contend that on the whole, elite colleges are too worried about harming their finances and rankings to match their rhetoric about wanting economic diversity with action. ""It's not clear to me that universities are hungry for that,"" said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation who studies college diversity. ""What happens if low-income students start calling the bluff of selective universities, and do start applying in much larger numbers? Will the doors be open?"" There are elite colleges, both private and public, with three times as many recipients of Pell Grants -- the main federal aid for low-income students -- as some of their peers, which critics say shows that the others could be doing more. Prestigious schools like Vassar, Amherst, Harvard and the University of California system have managed to increase low-income enrollment. ""A lot of it is just about money, because each additional low-income student you enroll costs you a lot in financial aid,"" said Michael N. Bastedo, director of the Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education at the University of Michigan. ""No one is going to talk openly and say, 'Oh, we're not making low-income students a priority.' But enrollment management is so sophisticated that they know pretty clearly how much each student would cost.""

Colleges generally spend 4 percent to 5 percent of their endowments per year on financial aid, prompting some administrators to cite this rough math: Sustaining one poor student who needs $45,000 a year in aid requires $1 million in endowment devoted to that purpose; 100 of them require $100 million. Only the wealthiest schools can do that, and build new laboratories, renovate dining halls, provide small classes and bid for top professors. The rankings published by U.S. News and World Report, and others, also play a major role. The rankings reward spending on facilities and faculty, but most pay little or no attention to financial aid and diversity. ""College presidents are under constant pressure to meet budgets, improve graduation rates and move up in the rankings,"" Dr. Carnevale said. ""The easiest way to do it is to climb upstream economically -- get students whose parents can pay more."" A big part of that climb has been the rise of ""merit aid,"" price breaks offered to desirable students regardless of their parents' wealth. A few dozen top schools give no merit aid, but they are the exception. Historically, American colleges gave far more need-based aid, but it is outweighed today by merit aid. Since the late 1990s, top schools have made several high-profile moves to become more accessible to low- and middle-income families. The policy changes drew heavy coverage, but had limited effect, studies found, largely because poorer consumers were unaware of them. Harvard, Princeton, the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill eliminated early admission programs that were seen as favoring affluent students. Some colleges stopped including loans in financial aid packages, so that all aid came in the form of grants. Others lowered prices for all but affluent families, not requiring any contribution from parents below a certain income threshold, like $65,000. But the colleges that ended early admissions reinstated them within a few years, after other elite schools declined to follow their lead, putting them at a disadvantage in drawing top students. Many of the benefits of the no-loan and no-parental-contribution policies went to middle-income families, and in any case, not all of the wealthiest schools, like Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Stanford, fully adopted both.

In 2006, at the 82 schools rated ""most competitive"" by Barron's Profiles of American Colleges, 14 percent of American undergraduates came from the poorer half of the nation's families, according to researchers at the University of Michigan and Georgetown University who analyzed data from federal surveys. That was unchanged from 1982. And at a narrower, more elite group of 28 private colleges and universities, including all eight Ivy League members, researchers at Vassar and Williams Colleges found that from 2001 to 2009, a period of major increases in financial aid at those schools, enrollment of students from the bottom 40 percent of family incomes increased from just 10 percent to 11 percent. Even with the best intentions, tapping the pool of high-performing low-income students can be hard. Studies point to many reasons poorer students with good credentials do not apply to competitive colleges, like lack of encouragement at home and at school, thinking (correctly or not) that they cannot afford it or believing they would be out of place, academically or socially. What distinguishes those who apply to elite schools is not family income or their parents' level of education, according to a groundbreaking study published last year, but location. Exposure to just a few high-achieving peers or attending a high school with just a few teachers or recent alumni who went to highly selective colleges makes a huge difference in where low-income students apply. ""You can make big statements about being accessible, and have need-blind admissions and really low net prices for low-income kids, but still enroll very few of those low-income kids, by doing minimal outreach,"" said Catharine Bond Hill, president of Vassar College. ""There has to be a commitment to go out and find them."" But admissions officers can visit only a small fraction of the nation's 26,000 high schools, so they rarely see those stellar-but-isolated candidates who need to be encouraged to apply. The top schools that have managed to raise low-income enrollment say that an important factor has been collaborating with some of the nonprofit groups, like QuestBridge and the Posse Foundation, that are devoted to identifying hidden prospects, working with them in high school and connecting them to top colleges. The programs can be expensive for colleges, and many balk at the cost, refusing to join or taking only a handful of students each year. ""Last year, we had only 680 slots for 15,000 students nominated by schools and community groups,"" said Deborah Bial, president of the Posse Foundation, which has 51 partner colleges but is trying to recruit more. ""We could easily triple in size, tomorrow.""

Troy Simon, 21, said that without significant help from two nonprofit groups, he would not be where he is now, preparing for his junior year at Bard College. It is a long way from his chaotic childhood in a poor section of New Orleans, where he was held back in school -- so far, in fact, that his story has been hailed by Michelle Obama as an example of what can be overcome. ""I was illiterate,"" he said. ""I clowned around in class, I didn't understand what was going on, and no one asked too many questions about my failing grades at home."" Separated from his family during Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed their home, he took refuge with cousins in an abandoned building. He was placed for a time in a school in Houston, where he said that at age 12, he finally began to learn to read, but after returning to New Orleans, he was arrested on suspicion of theft. But in high school -- he attended three of them -- a group called College Track took him in, providing tutoring, test preparation, counseling and advice on applying to college. Then he won a Posse Foundation scholarship that paid for college and provided support services there. ""The kids that I hung out with when I was a kid that were smart, some of them are dead now, some are in prison, some of them have several kids that they can't support,"" he said. ""I consider myself blessed."" Ten to 15 years ago, when some elite colleges got more serious about economic diversity, there was a view that increasing financial aid could turn the dial, but ""I think we were a little naive,"" said Morton O. Schapiro, president of Northwestern University, a former president of Williams College and, like Dr. Hill at Vassar, an economist specializing in the economics of higher education. Cost remains a barrier, but so does perception, he said, adding, ""It's a psychology and sociology thing, as well as a pricing thing."" College presidents like to say that consumers should not be scared off by high sticker prices, around $60,000 a year for top schools. But those are the numbers that draw national attention, concealing a much more tangled picture, in which true costs are hard to discern, hard to compare and wildly variable.

Public colleges remain less expensive, but in an era of declining state support, their prices have risen faster than those of private colleges, and they vary widely from state to state. Private colleges have sharply increased financial aid since the turn of the century, so that the average net price that families really pay has barely changed over the last decade, adjusted for inflation -- and for low-income students, it has actually dropped. But even top private colleges with similar sticker prices differ enormously in net prices, related to how wealthy they are, so a family can find that an elite education is either dauntingly expensive or surprisingly affordable. In 2011-12, net prices paid by families with incomes under $48,000 averaged less than $4,000 at Harvard, which has the nation's largest endowment, for example, and more than $27,000 at New York University, according to data compiled by the Department of Education. None of that complexity is apparent to most consumers. ""If you come from a family and a neighborhood where no one has gone to a fancy college, you have no way of knowing that's even a possibility,"" said Anthony W. Marx, president of the New York Public Library, and a former president of Amherst. ""And if you go on their website, the first thing you're going to look for is the sticker price. End of conversation."""
52618,Researchers Link Syrian Conflict to a Drought Made Worse by Climate Change,"Researchers said Monday that a recent extreme drought in Syria was most likely linked to climate change, and that the drought was a factor in the violent uprising there.",Women working in fields in northeastern Syria in 2010.  A new report suggests extreme drought in Syria was most likely a factor in the violent uprising that began there in 2011.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/04/science/03DROUGHT/03DROUGHT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=ab64174989cb15cf8dbc7cf22bd8cb52d427025184e2a82e2d2643b0aac27894&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/science/earth/study-links-syria-conflict-to-drought-caused-by-climate-change.html,e1097307-0321-59bc-ae6e-628ff3f7c8d2.jpg,"Women working in fields in northeastern Syria in 2010. A new report suggests extreme drought in Syria was most likely a factor in the violent uprising that began there in 2011.



Drawing one of the strongest links yet between global warming and human conflict, researchers said Monday that an extreme drought in Syria between 2006 and 2009 was most likely due to climate change, and that the drought was a factor in the violent uprising that began there in 2011. The drought was the worst in the country in modern times, and in a study published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists laid the blame for it on a century-long trend toward warmer and drier conditions in the Eastern Mediterranean, rather than on natural climate variability. The researchers said this trend matched computer simulations of how the region responds to increases in greenhouse-gas emissions, and appeared to be due to two factors: a weakening of winds that bring moisture-laden air from the Mediterranean and hotter temperatures that cause more evaporation. Colin P. Kelley, the lead author of the study, said he and his colleagues found that while Syria and the rest of the region known as the Fertile Crescent were normally subject to periodic dry periods, ""a drought this severe was two to three times more likely"" because of the increasing aridity in the region.

Dr. Kelley, who did the research while at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and is now at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said there was no apparent natural cause for the warming and drying trend, which developed over the last 100 years, when humans' effect on climate has been greatest.

Martin P. Hoerling, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration whose earlier work showed a link between climate change and aridity in the Eastern Mediterranean, said the researchers' study was ""quite compelling."" ""The paper makes a strong case for the first link in their causal chain,"" Dr. Hoerling said in an email, ""namely the human interference with the climate so as to increase drought likelihood in Syria."" Some social scientists, policy makers and others have previously suggested that the drought played a role in the Syrian unrest, and the researchers addressed this as well, saying the drought ""had a catalytic effect."" They cited studies that showed that the extreme dryness, combined with other factors, including misguided agricultural and water-use policies of the Syrian government, caused crop failures that led to the migration of as many as 1.5 million people from rural to urban areas. This in turn added to social stresses that eventually resulted in the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011.

What began as civil war has since escalated into a multifaceted conflict, with at least 200,000 deaths. The United Nations estimates that half of the country's 22 million people have been affected, with more than six million having been internally displaced. The researchers said that there were many factors that contributed to the chaos, including the influx of 1.5 million refugees from Iraq, and that it was impossible to quantify the effect of any one event like a drought. Francesco Femia, founder and director of the Center for Climate and Security, a research group in Washington that has long argued that the Syrian drought had a climate-change component, said the new study ""builds on previous work looking at the impact of drought on agricultural and pastoral livelihoods.""

""There's no question that the drought had a role to play in the mass displacement of people,"" he said. The link between climate change and conflict has been debated for years. A working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change wrote in 2014 that there was ""justifiable common concern"" that climate change increased the risk of armed conflict in certain circumstances, but said it was unclear how strong the effect was. The United States military has described climate change as a ""threat multiplier"" that may lead to greater instability in parts of the world.

Earlier studies trying to show a link between climate change and conflict have been rebutted by some scientists, and it is not clear how far this new study will go toward settling the issue. Thomas Bernauer, a professor of political science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who has been critical of some earlier studies, said he was skeptical about this one as well. ""The evidence for the claim that this drought contributed to the outbreak of civil war in Syria is very speculative and not backed up by robust scientific evidence,"" he wrote in an email. Mark A. Cane, an author of the study and a scientist at Lamont-Doherty, which is part of Columbia University, defended the work. ""I think there's a really good case here,"" he said. ""But I think we've tried to explain that the connection from an extraordinary climate event to conflict is complex and certainly involves other factors."""

""El elixir de los dioses"" (the elixir of the gods) is a potent and largely handcrafted libation that has been consumed at quinceaneras, weddings and funerals for generations in Oaxaca .

Unlike its cousin tequila, mezcal is not easy to produce commercially, limiting its export . And even with a boom in international interest, local mezcal maestros have focused on quality production in small batches. Witnessing the traditional process at a palenque, or artisanal distillery, is one of the few ways to understand mezcal's cultural significance.

Maguey, or the agave plant used to make mezcal, can take seven to 30 years to mature. There are roughly 30 different species used to make mezcal in Oaxaca, each with a distinct flavor: tobala, which takes an average 15 years to grow, has a smooth, fruity taste, while tepeztate, which matures in about 25 years, is strong and earthy; you can really taste the plant.

When a maguey plant is harvested, its sugar-rich base, the pina, is dug out of the ground; this ""pineapple"" is the key to mezcal. The pinas will be covered with rocks in an embers-lined pit and roasted for hours, giving mezcal its famously smoky taste. They are crushed and fermented; the mixture is then distilled several times over wood-burning ovens, yielding a spirit that is rated between 35 and 90 percent alcohol. I find that between 45 and 50 percent is the sweet spot."

For the first time at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon 2009, the top 10 seeds in women's singles all reached the third round, a surprising success given the tumult atop the women's game in recent years. And they did so with little turbulence, dropping only one set between them.

That stability quickly crumbled. Six of the top 10 seeds lost third round matches on Friday and Saturday, including several leading contenders. Nearly all lost against opponents they would have been expected to easily dismiss, and several with lopsided scorelines, clearing paths for several new and resurgent faces to contend for the first Grand Slam title of the decade.

The first leading contender to fall on Friday was the betting favorite, Serena Williams, the eighth seed. Williams lost 6-4, 6-7(2), 7-5 to Wang Qiang, whom she had thumped 6-1, 6-0 four months ago at the United States Open.

Cookbooks are still one of the best ways to pull yourself out of meal-planning fatigue and find an idea -- a pasta sauce, a flavor combination, a technique -- that can change your cooking forever. Book publishing, like so many other businesses, has been upended by the coronavirus pandemic. But now, when we truly need them, some wonderful new cookbooks are queued up and ready for order. Our staff made these selections with the limits of quarantine in mind, but also knowing that some people read cookbooks for the same reasons they would any other literature: learning, exploration, escape. 'Beyond the North Wind: Russia in Recipes and Lore' Darra Goldstein, a scholar and cookbook author, takes us far beyond the usual borscht and pickled-herring cliches of Russian cuisine in ""Beyond the North Wind"" (Ten Speed Press, $37.50). Her table is striking and unexpected, overflowing with vodka spiked with birch buds and golden dandelion blossom syrup stirred into tea. There are crisp mushroom hand pies flavored with caraway, veal stew sweetened with cherries and blinis for days, including Pushkin's favorite, dyed pink with beet juice and slathered with gooseberry preserves. Ms. Goldstein writes eloquently about Russian culinary history and traditions, all brought to life with photographs by Stefan Wettainen. MELISSA CLARK

'Bitter Honey: Recipes and Stories From the Island of Sardinia' Before she moved to Sardinia, the chef Letitia Clark worked in London restaurants, where she grew tired of cheffy cooking. Cooking was no longer joyous. Her first cookbook, ""Bitter Honey"" (Hardie Grant, $40) tells the story of her journey, as she says, learning to cook again with pleasure in place of stress. The recipes rely on high-quality ingredients, reflecting both a dreamy Sardinian lifestyle (four-hour lunches and handmade pasta) and approachable simplicity (roast chicken with a lemon-anchovy butter). VAUGHN VREELAND In ""Chicano Eats"" (Harper Design, $35), the Mexican-American food writer Esteban Castillo shares the food of his upbringing. Some of the recipes, like mole, tacos al pastor and churros, are traditional, while others, like carnitas poutine, cilantro-pesto rigatoni and guava cheesecake bars, are mash-ups. Everyone at my table was pleased with the pozole blanco, a traditional pork and hominy stew seasoned with onion, garlic, oregano and thyme. Another standout was the mac and queso fundido, a chorizo- and mushroom-spiked version of the best boxed mac you've ever had. MARGAUX LASKEY

Dimes is an all-day cafe on the Lower East Side of Manhattan known for big grain bowls and vivid smoothies that feel more California than New York. Its first cookbook, ""Dimes Times: Emotional Eating"" (Karma Books, $40), leans into that reputation with trippy, brightly colored illustrations and charts, like ""The Five Elements for a Cosmic Salad Creation."" The cafe's founders, Alissa Wagner and Sabrina De Sousa, organized the book, written with Toniann Fernandez, by hour and emotion (8 a.m. Determined, 6 p.m. Homesick) and offer a multitude of solid, simple recipes -- an endlessly adaptable lemony kale-almond pesto, a zippy green smoothie -- that will subtly elevate your everyday cooking. SARA BONISTEEL 'Everyone Can Bake: Simple Recipes to Master and Mix' This is not a book that will teach you how to make a Cronut, and really, why would you? It is a book that will help you take next steps as a baker when you're tired of banana bread and chocolate-chip cookies. (It could happen.) The thesis of ""Everyone Can Bake"" (Simon & Schuster, $37.50) by Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut, is that most desserts can be broken down into elements: bases (like vanilla shortbread or almond cake), fillings (like lemon curd or soft caramel) and finishings (like chocolate glaze or caramelized bananas). Choose your own adventure, guided by Mr. Ansel's experience and lively voice, and you might arrive at a basic chocolate layer cake, or at a passion-fruit tart on a puffed-rice crust with matcha cream. For hand-holding, there is detailed photography showing how to put the elements together. JULIA MOSKIN Even if you love to cook, doing so night after night can be a drag. Cleanup alone is reason to grow weary. With ""Keeping It Simple"" (Hardie Grant, $24.99), Yasmin Fahr has dedicated an entire book to the one-pot meal, so you can enjoy a well-rounded dinner without having to pull out every cooking vessel in your kitchen. Her miso-ghee roast chicken with radishes is a sophisticated take on the sheet-pan meal, and her baked eggs with barley, peppers and goat cheese is a hearty twist on shakshuka that would make an equally great weekend breakfast or weeknight dinner. MARGAUX LASKEY 'Meals, Music, and Muses: Recipes From My African American Kitchen' A classically trained opera singer and chef, Alexander Smalls describes his ""Meals, Music, and Muses: Recipes From My African American Kitchen"" (Flatiron Books, $35) as a playlist of African-American dishes. Chapters are loosely grouped by musical genre, to varying success: I'm not quite sure how deviled eggs are jazz, but I love that large-format, showstopping dishes are divas. Along with his co-author, Veronica Chambers, an editor at The Times, Mr. Smalls, of the Cecil and Minton's restaurants in New York, presents recipes that are approachable and flavorful. The Gullah dirty rice is spicy and layered, rich and earthy; a chess pie perfectly sweet-tart and tender on the tongue. Mr. Smalls notes that, where he's from (South Carolina), a cook is judged not by souffles, but by potato salad. His version, full of sweet pickle relish, is just five ingredients, plus salt and pepper. I ate it over a few days early on in my quarantine, and missed it for much longer when it was gone.

Since New York City restaurants closed for regular dining-room service, the chef Hooni Kim hasn't stopped cooking. He's been packing up the most comforting, family-style Korean meals he can for people, delivered from his Flatiron restaurant, Hanjan. Reassuring bowls of kimchi jjigae and galbijjim. Rainbows of banchan and tubs of rice. The range and finesse of Korean home cooking are at the heart of his precise, illuminating new cookbook ""My Korea"" (W.W. Norton & Company, $40), written with Aki Kamozawa, which moves just as easily from jjajangmyeon -- the everyday noodles dressed in a shimmering, meaty black-bean sauce -- to more delicate, complex dishes like homemade tofu with perilla soy sauce. TEJAL RAO Susan Spungen, a Hollywood food stylist, the founding food editor of Martha Stewart Living and an occasional NYT Cooking contributor, who styled and photographed the recipes for this article, describes her entertaining philosophy as studied nonchalance, ""like a messy bun on a beautiful girl."" This stuck with me as I cooked my way through her new cookbook, ""Open Kitchen"" (Avery, $35). While nothing I made looked as imperfectly perfect as in her photos, Ms. Spungen's meticulously written recipes produced magnificent dishes that could stand on their flavors alone. From her simple oven-dried tomatoes, to shrimp and chickpeas with chermoula, to a spicy parsnip cake with homemade candied ginger, all of her food is modern, clever and, in our house, instantly devoured. MELISSA CLARK 'Procrastibaking: 100 Recipes for Getting Nothing Done in the Most Delicious Way Possible' Two years ago, the Times reporter Julia Moskin wrote about the trend of baking as a way to avoid doing ""real"" work, and its thriving Instagram hashtag. A lot has changed since then. Lucky for us, the recipes in ""Procrastibaking"" (Atria Books, $24.99) by Erin Gardner are the delicious distraction we need these days. They range from the whimsical (baked Alaska ice cream cones, mall pretzels and rainbow roll cake) to the classic (gingersnaps, birthday cake and glazed doughnuts). Two favorites were the tender, flaky giant cinnamon roll scones and a chocolate pudding pie that's good-old-days nostalgia in dessert form. MARGAUX LASKEY"
5951,"Andy Warhol, Superstar",Blake Gopnik's mammoth biography traces the life and career of the original King of Pop.,Andy Warhol in 1974.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/05/books/review/05Sante1/05Sante1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a64319399c96578c49a5f8a3addff5ac076808218f3d03d922a559ca4d9219bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/books/review/warhol-blake-gopnik.html,e7dc4588-d1d8-5fc3-be80-a6db8784f76c.jpg,"Andy Warhol was not just an artist; he was a giant evolving sensibility that angled itself through a great portion of the late 20th century, absorbing everything in its passage and altering it, often permanently. He affected painting, film, fashion, partygoing, record-keeping, packaging, branding and a very large manifest of items that fall under the heading of self-presentation. His corpus includes everything from major paintings and epic films to Mylar balloons and generic business portraits to monosyllabic interview responses and the standard italic font that became wholly identified with his rubber-stamped signature. You can't really appreciate anything Warhol did without having some idea of its place in his evolution. Consequently Warhol, more than even van Gogh or Picasso, endures not as a mere collection of works but as a narrative, one that gets more complex the more closely you look. Conveying that narrative, coherently and comprehensively, was the task faced by the art critic Blake Gopnik as author of the first true doorstop biography (there have been earlier efforts, but none on this scale). He had to account for how a shy, ""effeminate"" child of Carpathian immigrants in working-class Pittsburgh came to occupy a central position in American and even global culture, while reinventing his artistic practice again and again, often radically, from the 1950s to his death at 58 in 1987, and also turning his unprepossessing self -- his bad skin, his passive and recessive personality, the toupees and wigs he wore to disguise his baldness, even his lifelong abject loneliness -- into an internationally recognized and respected trademark.

Having interviewed more than 260 people and consulted some 100,000 documents, Gopnik succeeds in establishing the chronology and tracing the fine lines of Warhol's many succeeding interests, decisions, departures, whims and relationships of all sorts. Few artists' biographies can have recorded so many changes -- in style, stance and social milieu -- occurring often on a week-to-week basis for some 35 years, amounting to a density of information more akin to, say, military history. We will all find our favorite Warhol avatar, of the hundreds on offer, somewhere within these pages. Mine is 33-year-old teeny-bopper Andy, who worked accompanied by loud pop 45s played on repeat. After the artist Ray Johnson visited the studio, he wrote in a letter the phrase ""We saw his recent paintings of Liz Taylor as we heard 'That Little Town Flirt'"" over and over for a page and a half. That period didn't last long -- Warhol was never much attuned to music, despite his association with the Velvet Underground -- but it resonates because his paintings of the early '60s share many qualities with the girl-group records of the same era: brass, grit, immediacy, not to mention the impression that both are at once throwaways and for the ages.

Gopnik excels at disentangling the strands of the narrative and correcting common lore. Even someone who has been actively aware of Warhol's career for more than half a century may forget that there were four separate Factories over 25 years and that the many famous superstars did not all coincide; Edie Sedgwick did not share a timeline with Candy Darling. (There is a way in which Warhol's career resembles successive iterations of a long-running TV franchise.) Gopnik's patient chronology brings a sense of proportion to the outline of the life. The Campbell's Soup cans lasted only a couple of years (with commercial reprises much later), and Warhol's body of work as a film director a mere five. By the same token, there are many generally overlooked pockets of his career, such as ""Raid the Icebox"" in 1969, when he compiled a touring collection of 404 objects from the storage rooms at the museum of the Rhode Island School of Design, including ""closetfuls of antique shoes""; such retrieval shows are common now, but were unknown then. And Gopnik gives the ""Time Capsules"" their due. These boxes (1974-87, and perhaps beyond), into which were thrown everything from junk mail to reels of film, were a natural progression from such earlier cataloging projects as the ""Screen Tests,"" but represented a leap of conceptual logic nevertheless. ""'It'll all get so simple that everything will be art,' Warhol had predicted back in 1966. ... Now he was finally making that prediction come true in full."" Gopnik's research turns up many testimonials by people who witnessed Warhol dropping his mask of robotic blankness and revealing the discerning intelligence within (few direct quotes, sadly), and he presses the case for Warhol remaining an ""Old Radical"" even while superficially resembling a ""New Conservative."" That does not prevent him from second-guessing his subject at every turn. He makes Warhol seem vaguely imitative for incorporating silk-screening into his paintings in 1962 -- a pioneering move, although he himself never made the claim -- because an employee of his alma mater was doing something like that in Andy's student days. He chides Warhol for his failures artistic and otherwise, and suggests he is being a conformist when he catches him coinciding with a general trend. He even scores Warhol for the angular signature logo of Interview magazine, ""the scrawl of an artist too confident, too busy and above all too important to take care of his writing.""

There are several odd features to the book. Gopnik seems to think that too many proper names will confuse the reader, so that quotes are attributed to ""one famous critic,"" ""a convert to Warhol,"" ""a hotshot young writer in New York,"" ""one of the founders of Dada,"" ""the same British critic who coined the term 'Pop Art'"" and so on, like so many blind items. When Gopnik cites a ""book of French film theory that had links to his Marilyns. ... Its inside front cover lined up 10 images of a gun-toting Marlon Brando that were perfectly echoed in Warhol's line of Elvises,"" he is obviously describing Edgar Morin's ""The Stars,"" so why not just say so in the text? (The book's endnotes appear online and in its e-book edition.) ""Warhol"" throws off such mixed signals that it is difficult to determine what kind of reader it was intended for. It is a 900-page brick that evinces much studious research, and yet it is pitched as if it were a feature in a newsmagazine, or as if its readers were primarily serial consumers of celebrity bios. Not expecting the reader to identify Marcel Duchamp or Robert Rauschenberg on first appearance may be standard practice, but Gopnik doesn't trust you'll remember them from one time to the next. As a consequence, only a handful of people ever appear without epithets. Any elder who exerted an influence on Warhol will have his or her name preceded by ""hero""; contemporaries are tagged as ""friend"" or ""rival."" Gopnik has no confidence in the reader's attention span, so recapitulations are constant; every point is made, made again, recast slightly, made yet again. Any foreshadowing that occurs early in Warhol's life -- or its reverse, the echoing that happens later on -- is liberally signposted, no matter how tenuous the connection. In 1967, a book by Warhol is published by Random House, ""a big, mainstream firm recently acquired by RCA, itself a major 1950s client of Warhol's that had also acquired Hallmark, the patron for Warhol's Christmas tree.""

The writing is often lazy and reductive in ways that suggest the book is meant for immediate consumption rather than durability. Someone is said to be ""blown away"" by a nightclub; a gallery is described as ""uber-hip."" Gopnik writes, ""It's not clear how entertaining the plotless 'Lonesome Cowboys' could really have been for a moviegoing public accustomed to the adventures of Herbie the Love Bug"" -- could he have chosen a movie less likely to share an audience with a Warhol production? He hits the soup-can air horn again and again: ""Presley ... had a genuine importance that made him more Cordon Bleu than Campbell's Soup""; Warhol ""was canned soup, not eel bisque finished with smoked cotton candy."" And when Gopnik takes off on a literary flight, the vessel is likely to crash: ""At his best, Warhol didn't think outside the box. He thought outside any artistic universe whose laws would allow boxes to exist."" All those things make the book much more difficult to read than it ought to be. Warhol made extraordinary work and led an equally extraordinary, unprecedented life that carried with it a significant budget of pain. He bridged the chasm between high and low as no one had before, and repeatedly found new ways to tilt the balance between art and life. He initiated or anticipated so many ways that people would later use communication and imagery that he could pass as having predicted Twitter and Instagram. He was gay, and presented himself to the world as a metonym of gayness (which did not prevent him from employing women as beards at times, nor his mother from trying to get him married off). He realized the social art that many had merely theorized before him; wherever he was, he turned his milieu into a spectacle, with every routine occurrence qualifying as an action, accruing documentation as it went. He played with the idea of business art as a kind of parody, then found himself ensnared in the real thing and dragged ever further into its depths, to the point of signing limited-edition prints of Superman, Mickey Mouse, Santa Claus and other characters who by then were sub-Pop. Gopnik gives the reader all the pertinent facts of Warhol's life, yet his ever-present lecturer's whiteboard obscures all but the occasional fugitive glimpse of Warhol's soul."
6371,I'm Sick of Asking Children to Be Resilient,"It's time for reparations and resources and to not expect kids to ""rise above.""","Dr. Hanna-Attisha is an advocate for universal basic income and living wages, and enhancing health and safety protections, along with benefits like paid parental and sick leave.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/12/opinion/12-inequality-Attisha-promo/12-inequality-Attisha-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=975f5fec97ecb2fbfa694b1ed9f96b924566b482d89be8ab9091a29c18edd296&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/opinion/sunday/flint-inequality-race-coronavirus.html,06749494-48ef-53b9-830b-b1a7bc3506c4.jpg,"FLINT, Mich. -- A baby born in Flint, where I am a pediatrician, is likely to live almost 20 fewer years than a child born elsewhere in the same county. She's a baby like any other, with wide eyes, a growing brain and a vast, bottomless innocence -- too innocent to understand the injustices that without her knowing or choosing have put her at risk. Some of the babies I care for have the bad luck to be born into neighborhoods where life expectancy is just over 64 years. Only a few miles away, in a more-affluent community, the average life span is 84 years. The ravages of Covid-19, which disproportionately affect low-income families and people of color, are surely widening this gap even further.

Throughout the United States, geography defines and describes inequities in health, wealth, mobility and longevity. The reasons for this are both visible and hidden. Life in a distressed neighborhood means limited access to health care and healthy food. It means living with violence, racism, poverty and uncertainty. It means bearing the brunt of environmental injustice -- not having safe and affordable water, as Flint knows too well, or living in the shadow of a polluting factory. More air pollution increases rates of respiratory disease and reduces student achievement as well as life span. We are also beginning to understand the interplay of water access and air quality with Covid-19 severity.

These disparities between neighborhoods are rarely accidental; they are the product of purposeful policies and practices that have widened gaps in income, opportunity and equality. Over the decades, city inhabitants have been battered by deindustrialization; racist banking and real estate practices; white flight and population loss; austerity cuts to public education, public health and safety net programs; the corporate-driven weakening of unions; dilution of environmental regulations; housing and nutrition insecurity; and racially driven mass incarceration. And so much more. Science tells us that children exposed to multiple adversities, both in their home and in their neighborhood, have a far greater likelihood of challenges later in life. From addiction to eviction, these constant pressures change children on a molecular, cellular and behavioral level -- and make them sick. The effects of toxic stress can be as disruptive as environmental pollution on their bodies and brains, increasing risk for chronic diseases like asthma and hypertension, and lowering life expectancy. Exposure to six or more adverse childhood experiences can cut a life short by as much as 20 years.

All of us who live or work in this beleaguered community know somebody who has died from the disease caused by the coronavirus. There's Wendell Quinn, the gentle giant of a hospital public safety officer who always gave me a warm smile and a nod when I walked into work; and Ruben Burks, the dedicated United Auto Workers leader; and Nathel Burtley, the first black superintendent of Flint schools; and Karen Dozier, the kind and loving custodian at the early child care center. And bringing a level of grief that is difficult to comprehend, Calvin Munerlyn, a Family Dollar store security guard and devoted father of six, was recently shot and killed after telling a shopper to wear a mask. The epidemic of gun violence has compounded tragedy upon tragedy.

At a multigenerational level of loss, there are the Jones and Brown families. Within weeks, a Flint elementary school principal, Kevelin B. Jones II, lost his father, Pastor Kevelin B. Jones; his uncle Freddie Brown Jr.; and his cousin Freddie Brown III. At the combined burial for her husband and only child, Sandy Brown waved to the parade of cars that drove by quietly as she stood alone next to two freshly dug graves. Reflecting on the difficult losses, a church elder, Keimba Knowlin, spoke on resilience, a quality that I've long observed and admired in the people of Flint. ""We're going to rise above this and get past this,"" he said. More from ""The America We Need"" The will to survive and endure can be the deciding factor between a child who overcomes adversity and thrives and a child who never makes it to adulthood. But how long can we ask people born in the wrong ZIP code to ""rise above"" and persevere in circumstances beyond their control, no matter how central the idea of overcoming is to our archetypal American identity? When Hazim Hardeman, a 2019 Rhodes scholar, was asked about his journey from public housing in North Philadelphia, where many of his friends were shot or stabbed to death, he spoke a truth that we all need to hear: ""Don't be happy for me that I overcame these barriers. Be mad as hell that they exist in the first place."" Surviving life's hardest blows should not be celebrated -- or expected. Recovery and reconciliation require reparations and resources. To expect resilience without justice is simply to indifferently accept the status quo. Just as the New Deal sprang from the Great Depression and public health best practices were born in response to a previous plague, we need to embrace the bold innovations that are certain to arise. To begin with, we need to establish policies and practices rooted in science. And science tells us that where you live matters. For children raised in places replete with the stresses of misfortune, these adversities rooted in historic and systemic bias are scarring. Just as new Covid-19 cases can represent a time lag from infection two weeks earlier, adversities in early childhood play out later, filling our hospital beds and deteriorating the public's health. As this pandemic makes painfully visible, medicine alone -- ventilators, pharmaceuticals, defibrillators, I.C.U.s -- will not save us. It's always an ego-deflating moment for my medical residents when they learn that medical care contributes only 10 percent to 20 percent to positive health outcomes. Our medical interventions are largely reactive measures -- and happen too late. Addressing the upstream root causes is the only answer.

These big and bold ideas are not new. They are measures proved to improve health, quality of life and longevity -- standards that most developed countries already employ. And to ensure we are moving in the same direction together, the pathogens of divisiveness and bigotry need to be treated as the deadly, life-shortening contagions they truly are. This is how we begin to transform the concept of resilience from an individual trait to one that describes a community -- and society -- that cares for everyone. Rather than hoping a child is tough enough to endure the insurmountable, we must build resilient places -- healthier, safer, more nurturing and just -- where all children can thrive.

In an interview, Ms. Martin described the appointment as an ""opportunity to expand what we think of as British art, not only for the 20th and 21st centuries, but for all periods."" One of her priorities as director will be to reposition British art within a global framework of migration and cultural exchange.

""The museum has amazing collections of art that might have once been described as coming from the Commonwealth, and I would really like to show more works that come from the South Pacific and South Asia,"" she said. ""There are notable links between British artists working outside of the country and artists born in those places.""

Ms. Martin has deep experience with British art, particularly of the postcolonial era. She has written extensively on the Pakistani-born artist and editor Rasheed Araeen, and in 2012 she organized an exhibition of the Guyanese-British painter Frank Bowling at Tate Britain in London."
52233,Prada and Armani Reassert the Power of Consistency,"The elegant, dark clothing on several runways showed designers moving toward greater reserve and personal calm.","''Uniform, severe, elegant: This is the fashion I like at this moment,'' Ms. Prada was quoted as saying.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/22/fashion/22fprada-A/22fprada-A-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=364cabbb17f7396a4e479ce36d17e126b8c1971e560108904b5512ebf3a34405&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/22/fashion/while-gucci-charts-a-new-course-prada-and-armani-reassert-the-power-of-consistency.html,06714ea0-50e9-5eaa-ae7b-7a8f763d8dff.jpg,"MILAN -- One of the commonest sights outside fashion shows, in whatever city they're held, is hordes of shutterbugs racing to snap pictures of what is loosely described as ""street fashion."" Often the photographers form a phalanx, a kind of flying wedge, and back shoulder to shoulder into traffic snapping away as their quarry advances. They're like crazy birders. Watch them long enough, though, or track their Instagram accounts and you will soon observe that they're tracking just one kind of bird: the fashion cuckoo. There is that Japanese personage seen at so many shows dressed in plus-fours, or short shorts and wearing a platinum blonde wig reminiscent of Joey Heatherton (Google her: worth a look.) There is the guy who routinely pulls off the full Henry Higgins, with a cape, gloves of mustard leather, even a pipe. There's the charming, and shrewd, style writer for a major Italian daily who turned up everywhere throughout the past wintry week here shod in fake-fur (or pelle ecologica, to use the hilarious Italian term) sandals from Ainea. Spend any time among these ambulating punch lines -- characters that seem to have swapped immersion in daily life for the nebulous reality of the web -- and you start hankering for a little pre-Kardashian-era propriety.

While this formulation may come as a revelation to some in the fashion vortex, in academic terms it is so dated as to be ... vintage. Practically speaking, though, what her statement signified was that Ms. Prada was simultaneously showing clothes for women and men (pre-fall for women, fall for men.) The more relevant cultural import of Ms. Prada's new turn in direction -- at least in this observer's eyes -- came from a clear ambition to eschew anything designed first to please the camera and those who voraciously and compulsively scan their social media feeds.

""Uniform, severe, elegant: This is the fashion I like at this moment,"" Ms. Prada was quoted as saying of the starkly simple coats and eight-button suit jackets and unostentatiously conservative somber clothes any man might be happy to be own -- that is, if he didn't mind knowing he couldn't get arrested on Instagram dressed like that. Ms. Prada was far from the only designer who gave signs of moving away from social media brand showmanship, toward greater reserve and personal calm.

Thom Browne and Giorgio Armani, two names seldom heard in the same sentence, each offered shows that in their essence distilled their historical strengths, Mr. Browne for Moncler Gamme Bleu and Mr. Armani for both Emporio Armani and his main Armani line. Both Moncler Gamme Bleu and Emporio Armani started with a bit of theatrics. At Moncler, clusters of models in down jackets colored one of four different ways, and with skull caps, goggles and snap-side trousers, entered a show space where paper birch trees had been installed at regular intervals, an anomalous hanger suspended from each. At some unseen signal, strobe lights were cued, the models all whipped off their trousers and, voila, ""Magic Mike."" At Emporio Armani, a posse of models clad in cat-burglar suits (actually Armani's EA7 ski wear) skittered onto the runway in semi-darkness to form a tableau. Cue models with flashlights. Cue glimpse of pulchritude. Exit models runway right.

Some theater is always not only a welcome but necessary way for fashion show viewers to relieve the numberless hours spent in unnatural states of forced passivity. Only afterward do the theatrics fall away and one becomes aware that Mr. Armani, in his masterful way, has deployed again the tools, techniques and concern for male beauty to which he has remained true for decades -- showing for his Giorgio Armani show, titled ""Romance,"" snugly shaped and soft suiting in muted tones, cocooning fur scarves, full trousers that tapered from waist to cuff in a slightly feminizing manner, jackets that fell somewhere between blazer and a bomber; shaped suits and beautifully simple coats; and then, more compellingly, at Emporio Armani, cropped snug jackets over ribbed leggings in a near-monochrome palette; as surface ornament, a bold pattern resembling a paint brush stroke, trousers with diagonal zippers that cut from waistband to ankle. The latter struck a viewer as both ingenious and perplexing. How, precisely, was a wearer supposed to ... well, never mind. Mr. Browne, too, had a simple core message, one that returned him to the down-filled puffer jackets he designed after going into partnership with Remo Ruffini, the Italian industrialist and savant who revived what had been a faded ski-wear label and so successfully restored its cool he ultimately fielded one of the more successful fashion stock market offerings in recent memory.

Finally, though, and as most everyone knows, few of the designs seen on a Moncler runway are destined for production. What you are destined to see everywhere is the show's obvious moneymaker. It was a perfectly simple, deep-blue, waist-length puffer jacket a lot of men will stretch to own. ""That's exactly the one I want,"" Federico Marchetti, chief executive of Yoox, the online retailer, laughed merrily as he made his way into the chill evening. Likely Mr. Marchetti will have something left of his paycheck after that particular purchase. That is more than you can say for a lot of other Moncler customers.

Mr. Maier lives part time in South Florida, as is well known. Perhaps a bit of the eccentricity of dress so characteristic of the subjects depicted in Harry Benson's photographs for the book ""Palm Beach People"" has rubbed off on him. That pink trousers and camel hair coat get-up? You'll see wackier ensembles by far at Hamburger Heaven on North Clematis Street in West Palm any hangover Sunday morning. If, as was strenuously asserted by a Gucci spokesman, the runway show on Monday bore no imprint of the ousted Frida Giannini and was assembled by the head accessories designer Alessandro Michele and a workroom team in under a week, it may not be fair to judge this collection as anything other than a placeholder between old and new. But with the news on Wednesday that the little-known Mr. Michele had been named creative director of both men's and women's wear, a collection created on a cliffhanger deadline took on a different significance. The hearty ovation greeting the team members when they all came onto the runway for a postshow bow better reflected admiration for effort than praise for a collection that leaned far too heavily on androgyny tropes no one has had much success with at Gucci since Tom Ford. Were the boys-will-be-girls-will-be-boys casting, the overfamiliar gender blur, the crepe and chiffon and pipe-cleaner trousers, mumsy stock-ties, sleeveless shirts in gilded lace signs of where Mr. Michele plans to lead a venerable house into future? If so, will he be doing so wearing a pair of the mink-lined mules he showed on the runway?"

Next to this increasingly varied repertory, Graham's work can stand out as drearily dated or intensely urgent. The mind jumps between asking, ""Why does this still exist?"" and ""Can this please never go away?""

Her 1936 ""Chronicle,"" an antiwar statement in three parts, is of the ""never go away"" variety. As the troupe's most vital, enduring piece, it brought Thursday's program (Program A) to an exhilarating close, eclipsing some of the less inspired offerings before it.

Graham often designed her own costumes, fashioning fabric into extensions of (or restraints on) the body. In ""Spectre -- 1914,"" the first section of ""Chronicle,"" the soloist (PeiJu Chien-Pott on Thursday) wears a long black dress lined with bright red. Like the movement -- and the multitiered pedestal where the triumphant Ms. Chien-Pott began, seated upright and in profile -- this garment is both freeing and grounding. Its heavy skirts, draped over the platform, give the illusion of a body inseparable from the earth. But the soloist, once on her feet, deftly takes that weight into her hands, flashing the red underside as if signaling danger."

When Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi wrote and directed the mockumentary ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" they, along with Jonathan Brugh and Ben Fransham, played centuries-old vampires in Wellington, New Zealand, struggling with their unending lives and the quotidian frustrations of modernity. It's a comedic conceit these New Zealand natives had been toying with for ages, long before Waititi (the director of the Marvel blockbuster ""Thor: Ragnarok"") and Clement (who, with Bret McKenzie, formed the comic music duo Flight of the Conchords) had any Hollywood standing -- going back to the late 1990s, when they became friends at Victoria University of Wellington. After it opened -- in 2014 in most of the world, and in 2015 in the United States -- the film received some supportive reviews and gained a cult following. But its modest ticket sales seemed to drive a stake through the heart of any further possibilities for it. Now Clement and Waititi have a new FX series, also called ""What We Do in the Shadows."" It debuts on March 27, and follows a different crew of vampires and their struggles to settle down in Staten Island.

On a March night, surrounded by the decadent revelry of the South by Southwest festival, Clement, who created, wrote and directed on the FX series, and Waititi, who directed several episodes, gathered with Paul Simms (""Atlanta,"" ""NewsRadio"" and ""The Larry Sanders Show""), one of their executive producers. They met here in an ornate chamber at the Driskill, a Romanesque-style hotel that opened in 1886. Amid the spooky atmospheric elements -- some intentional, some accidental -- they spoke about their affection for the undead and the creation of the new show. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. So FX showed me the first few episodes ---- [the lights in the room begin to flicker] 

 JEMAINE CLEMENT I don't know, because my eyes were closed. I was relaxing. I was saying ---- [lights flicker again]. It seems to happen whenever I talk. 



I was worried I'd miss your original film characters in the TV version of ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" but I'm glad to say I didn't.

 WAITITI It's a little bit of a Roman dagger in my back. CLEMENT We thought about that movie for a long time, over years and years. But the actual movie, we only shot for four or five weeks. WAITITI I really wanted to make a mockumentary thing because I'd just tried to make a short one about police dogs. But the dogs were played by people. This was like 2002, 2003, and I thought that was the easiest way to shoot stuff. Just leave the camera on -- you really didn't have to try.

Where did vampires enter into it? CLEMENT We had played this thing on stage one time. Taika, Bret and I all went to Calgary, to do a show, where one of us was on stage playing a vampire, doing vampire jokes. The only one I remember is like [exaggerated Slavic accent]: ""I just flew from Transylvania, and boy are my arms tired. Because they were wings, and I flew all the way."" I think that was Taika doing that, and then I'd get up from the audience, dressed as a vampire, too, and I'm heckling him. WAITITI ""You've been heckling me for 250 years!"" 

 CLEMENT ""You heckled me in Vienna in 1563!"" 

 WAITITI ""And then I chopped your head off!"" ""Ah, you have a new head, my friend."" 



CLEMENT I forgot that joke. ""Yes, I have a different head."" 

 WAITITI ""Ah, but I remember the voice. And the heckles."" When we first met in Wellington, nothing was really open late at night except for video-game parlors. We would hang around, playing air hockey and doing those kinds of characters. ""Ah, my old rival."" Just keep the stupid thing going on for ages. Were vampires part of your cultural upbringings? 

 CLEMENT I remember waking up at 5 years old, and my parents were watching a horror movie. It was ""Scars of Dracula."" There's a skeleton lying on a stone tomb, a bat flies in and drops blood on it, and it becomes Dracula again. It's ridiculous, but back then, it was like, whoa. I had nightmares about vampires after that for years. 

 WAITITI I grew up in a tiny, tiny, tiny, little fishing village on the East Coast of New Zealand. Basically, the place where you'd take marlin to get weighed was in this shed, down on the pier. And they'd turn it into a cinema for three or four months. So when I was 7 or 8, I saw George Hamilton in ""Love at First Bite,"" in this shed, projected on a sheet. 

 CLEMENT Working with Paul and the other writers in the writers' room, not everyone knew about vampires. Taika and I know a lot about vampires. SIMMS Definitely, none of us knew as much as Jemaine. 

 CLEMENT A lot of the ideas in the first week, I'm just going, ""No. You can't do that."" [laughs] ""Vampires can't do that."" 

 SIMMS I wrote a fantastic joke where they were having appetizers that were leeches full of blood. 



SIMMS That's my point, still -- they could just chew the blood out. The writers' room was a lot of arguments. Was it bittersweet for you that the original ""Shadows"" movie was not more widely seen? 

 WAITITI How dare you! My mom saw it and she loved it. That's all I care about. 

 CLEMENT I had the opposite experience because the idea came from when we weren't professionals at all, and it's really us joking around with a bunch of our friends. It surprises me how many people have seen that movie. 

 WAITITI Our production designer took the discarded green screens from ""The Hobbit"" and built a house out of it. And they were just going to throw it away and burn it. 

 CLEMENT If you peel back the old wallpaper, you'd see the green.

CLEMENT We didn't. Scott Rudin saw the film and then started harassing us until we did it. 

 WAITITI I was in Hawaii, about to have my second kid. It'd be like three or four in the morning, the phone would ring, and it would be him. 

 CLEMENT [American producer voice] ""Taika. We've got to do this show. When is this show happening? We've got to get it rolling. I know it can go.""

 WAITITI When it's like three or four in the morning, the only thing you can say to get rid of people is like: ""Yeah, yeah, totally, just do it. O.K., we're doing it. Bye."" And the show happened. 

 CLEMENT The thing is, in the movie, we were the bosses and we never had to take notes. Now we have to take notes from the network. 

 WAITITI Take notes on something you created and you know everything about. 

 CLEMENT And a lot of the notes are like, ""In the movie ... "" Oh, man. We know. We did the movie. Did you ever consider reprising your movie roles in the TV show?

 WAITITI They encouraged us to do it. ""It'd be really cool if you guys were in the show, at least one of you."" Well, I'm not going to do it if he's not going to do it. Neither of us really wanted to do it. 



CLEMENT In TV, there's just so much to do. 

 WAITITI It's hard enough listening to your own voice while you're editing. And then also listening to your own voice while you're directing. And acting. Doing a stupid accent and then stopping and giving a note. You're just talking all day long. 

 SIMMS I think Jemaine thought that it was going to be easier than it is by not being in it. 

 WAITITI We were doing night shoots in Toronto -- when I say ""we,"" I had it easy. I came in for like the last three weeks. It was like coming to a battlefield in France in World War I. They were so haggard and tired and half dead. 

 CLEMENT It took Taika about three days to get that way. 

 WAITITI When I was outside, I was wearing two Canada Goose jackets. Then I'm hanging out inside this drugstore where we had put the monitors, going: ""I'm not going out there to give them direction. They can come in here if they want direction."" I think we wrapped at like 7 a.m. and Jemaine was still going on another set. I turn up and Jemaine is curled up in a ball, half asleep, looking at this monitor, going, ""Mmmm. Uhhh."" Like, mumbling. You've worked with Paul, going back to the ""Flight of the Conchords"" HBO series. How did he fare in these conditions? 

 SIMMS I did not mind the night shoots at all. That's my natural schedule, anyway. 

 WAITITI We'd nap all the time. I'd see a couch and be like, ""There's my couch."" Matt Berry is also a huge napper. On the sets, we'd scope out the beds. And I'd be, ""Oh, that's mine."" And then I'd come in and Matt would be in it. 



CLEMENT Usually when you have a house set, there's bedrooms with beds. But there's no beds on this, because it's coffins. There's nowhere to sleep. So everyone's got to really search: ""Ah, now that human character has a bed.""

 WAITITI The college bedroom on the pilot, me and Matt were fighting over that bed all the time. 

 CLEMENT But there was a sign on the door: ""No sleeping."" 

 WAITITI And then in smaller letters: ""Unless you're Taika."" What, if anything, has the experience of making the show further taught you about vampires? 

 SIMMS The show is funny and silly, but it is about the sadness of eternal life. 

 CLEMENT There is a sadness about not letting go. 

 WAITITI Humans are so [expletive] stupid and boring and lazy, that given the gift of immortality, you'd never get around to doing anything. You'd just put off everything. People that have been alive for 5,000 years, going: ""I've got forever to learn how to play violin. Why start now?"" Humans, they still carry on human nature into being an undead creature. All those hang-ups stay with you."
8666,Talking With Your Teen About Anti-Racism? Be Ready to Listen,"Many of today's teenagers have a keener understanding of what constitutes racism than their predecessors, based on what they have learned both in school and online.","Lucas Richard, left, and his twin brother, Santiago, right, with their sister, Noa, at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Miami.

In many cases young people are not only opposed to racism, but they have embraced the call to work actively against it. Indeed, as many parents have already discovered, our teenagers are often more adept at recognizing and challenging bigotry than we are.

There are good reasons for this. Herded together at school, adolescents are more likely than many adults to have close encounters with peers who don't share their views. Running into more friction gives teenagers a greater number of opportunities to sharpen their skills at confronting one another. Further, many of today's teenagers have a keener understanding of what constitutes racism than their predecessors, both because of what they are learning in school and also their own participation in a sometimes elaborate online discourse about intolerance.

Sydney Sofola, age 17, of Oklahoma City, acknowledges that while the ""internet gets a bad rap,"" it's where she has learned a great deal about anti-racism. When a peer posts something inappropriate online, she explained that ""people will slide up and say, 'I don't agree with that statement and here's why.'"" Biased posts are often met with a detailed, critical comments section. ""You see other people confronting racism. If someone presents a bad argument, you may have already seen the rebuttal to that argument on the internet.""

Whether in person or online, today's teenagers may also be quicker to challenge intolerance than adolescents of past generations. ""They are more willing to call each other out than the teenagers I taught 20 to 25 years ago"" says Kristin Harder, a teacher at the Rivers School in Weston, Mass. The students she taught at the start of her career, she noted, had a tendency to try to explain away insensitive comments; more of today's young people, however, seem to be game for hard conversations."
38413,The Otherworldly Beauty of a Dying Sea,"The Dead Sea is falling by more than a meter a year, and paradoxically, its destruction is revealing an eerie, enchanting world below the waters.","As the Dead Sea recedes, salt formations along the shore come into view.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/23/travel/23deadsea14/23deadsea14-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0aba5487f616cf01c3b0f6d9fdd20c08e5b8aad418199c360554a1a057b93d25&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/travel/the-otherworldly-beauty-of-a-dying-sea.html,a1029461-9993-58ac-a2a7-a9562dac4306.jpg,"Jake Ben Zaken steered his boat along the western shore of the Dead Sea, cut the motor, and bobbed amid the white towers of salt rising out of the turquoise water. Just last year, many of these circular towers, their bumpy surfaces now glistening in the afternoon sun, were beneath the water in this shrinking salty lake. ""I look for the beauty in this environmental crisis,"" said Mr. Ben Zaken, whose Salty Landscapes boat tours take travelers out onto the surface of the Dead Sea, where the water level is falling by more than a meter a year as human consumption depletes its sources. ""I'm trying to the see the light, because the darkness is always there."" The tours -- the only current commercial option for boating on the Dead Sea -- are part of a tourism industry that, paradoxically, is growing, even as the sea, famous for its highly salinated water, mud and minerals and for being the lowest place on earth, dries up.

Because it is not connected to an ocean, the Dead Sea is not technically a sea, but a lake. For the last 60 years, it has been shrinking as the surrounding populations of Syria, Israel, Jordan and the West Bank have depleted its main water sources -- the Jordan River and Sea of Galilee (also a lake) -- and as fertilizer and chemical companies in both Israel and Jordan evaporate its water to extract minerals, scientists say. The surface area of the lake has contracted by about a third to its current 630 square kilometers, according to the Geological Survey of Israel.

Hotels and spas that once lined the waterfront are now hundreds of meters from the shoreline, and some resorts and beaches have been forced to close in recent years because of the thousands of sinkholes that have resulted from the drying up of the water and the ground around it. Fences with signs warning of sinkholes line much of the western coast, whose dry brown expanse is also dotted with abandoned date palm groves, closed roads, and shuttered buildings, including a defunct gas station. In many places the shoreline is covered with crusts of salt. Pillars and blobs of salt rise from the shallow edges of the water.

The southern basin -- always shallower than the deep northern basin where Mr. Ben Zaken runs his boat trips -- would be completely dry now if the companies harvesting salts and minerals from the Dead Sea didn't pump water into it, according to scientists. In Jordan, where the number of tourists rose about 8 percent in 2017 compared to 2016 and is on track to increase at a similar rate in 2018, a new Hilton Hotel opened last year on the Dead Sea, and $1.5 billion joint Kuwaiti-Jordanian government project is underway to build more hotels, an amusement park and other tourism infrastructure along the seashore. While the northern basin will likely not disappear any time soon, it is expected to become shallower and to lose an additional 10 percent of its surface area in the next 50 years, said Nadav Lensky, the head of the Geological Survey's Dead Sea Observatory, which researches evaporation and other dynamics of the sea.

The falling water level also means that the salinity of the water has increased, and since the 1980s, the water has become so concentrated that crystals of salt now accumulate on the bottom in a process called halite precipitation. ""The Dead Sea is the only place in the world where we see this phenomenon in modern time,"" Mr. Lensky said, explaining that millions of years ago, halite precipitation in many of the deep saline lakes that once covered the earth led to the creation of massive, thick salt deposits in places like Poland's Wieliczka salt mines and the oil-rich Delaware Basin under Texas and New Mexico. It is also halite precipitation that has created the salt sculptures that first began peeking out above the surface of the Dead Sea about 10 years ago, Mr. Lensky said. Because the shape, size and number of salt crystals piling up on the sea bottom vary with the water's salinity, evaporation rate and temperature, the resulting structures also vary in shape, he said. With much of the sea's western shore off limits because of sinkholes, Mr. Ben Zaken's blue and red Dutch-made boat -- named Nefeli after a cloud nymph in Greek mythology -- is the only way to see this otherworldly salty landscape up close. ""It was like being on the moon,"" said Natali Tamir, a smartphone photography instructor from Tel Aviv who was inspired to take the boat ride in October after seeing photographs that one of her students had taken on a previous tour. ""I have been to the Dead Sea many times and was aware of what was happening there, but on this boat I suddenly understood how dramatic it is, and how sad it is seeing things that won't be there in five years."" The tours, which require advance reservation, leave from the Dead Sea shore near the Mitzpe Shalem settlement on the Israeli-occupied West Bank, about 45 miles from Jerusalem. A one-and-a half-hour tour is 180 shekels ($48) and a three-hour tour is 250 shekels ($67) per person. The boat holds up to 12 people.

Bobbing among the salt towers, Mr. Ben Zaken pointed out similar structures on the shore, where the water has receded, now brown and gray, and some toppled over. ""Those are dead,"" he said, before starting up the boat's engine and motoring past islands of salt that resembled heaps of melting snow or piles of shiny pearls. Mr. Ben Zaken, 54, -who lives in Mitzpe Shalem, served in Israel's Navy and worked on a commercial crab boat in Alaska. He cranked up the motor and headed to deeper water. The salt formations faded into the distance, as did the desolate brown beaches beyond them. Across the water to the east rose Jordan's pink Abarim mountains. ""I am all alone out here,"" Mr. Ben Zaken said as he reached a speed of about 25 knots, fast enough to leave a wake on the water, which reaches depths of about 1,000 feet. Aside from a scientific research boat located several miles south near Ein Gedi, and not visible from here, Mr. Ben Zaken's Nefeli -- and the fleet of kayaks he began operating last year -- were the only vessels on the Dead Sea. Military restrictions, a constantly-receding shoreline and expensive maintenance to prevent salt buildup on the bottom of vessels all make boating here difficult, and contributed to the closing about 15 years ago of a large wooden ship named Lot's Wife (she famously turned into a pillar of salt in the Bible) that took groups of tourists out on the water, Mr. Ben Zaken said. But historical texts and archaeological finds of ancient anchors and harbors indicate that the Dead Sea had a thriving maritime culture for thousands of years. ""Like any other sea, it should have boats,"" said Mr. Ben Zaken, who bought his first boat in 2011, when he was working as an auto mechanic, then waited two years for military permission to start using it and build up a tour business. Last year, he added kayak tours, bought a second boat, and is looking to hire an additional skipper to meet growing demand.

Continuing south, the last stop on tour was his kibbutz's Mineral Beach resort, which was forced to close in 2015 after a large sinkhole opened up, swallowing up palm trees, the parking lot and some buildings. The air smelled like sulfur, and the water was the color of pea soup. The lifeguard stand had collapsed onto the gray sand, and empty lounge chairs sat under thatch palm huts. Mr. Ben Zaken pointed to a wooden shed that used to serve as his boat house. After the beach closed, he lost access to the boat shed, and now has to launch his tours from a point further south, reachable only with an off-road vehicle. At the end of each day, he pulls his boat out of the water, loads into on a trailer, then hauls it with a tractor more than half a mile through the desert, over dry land that was once underwater, and rinses the salt water off the boat each night.

53441,The Human Family Tree Bristles With New Branches,"Scientists reported finding another species of ancient hominid, Australopithecus deyiremeda, fanning debate over the pace of evolution and the number of human forebears.","The find suggests that hominids, like the one this jaw came from, may have been much more diverse much earlier than previously thought.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/28/science/28zimmer-b/28zimmer-b-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=ca46de5be991a7598bbc0833b28146236f3c8050adc7faa90d54b1b4bd6715b3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/science/adding-branches-to-the-human-family-tree.html,bda6672e-c0df-54e0-ac51-dbd7375cafe2.jpg,"Half of a jawbone discovered in Ethiopia that dates to between 3.3 and 3.5 million years ago.



For scientists who study human evolution, the last few months have been a whirlwind. Every couple of weeks, it seems, another team pulls back the curtain on newly discovered bones or stone tools, prompting researchers to rethink what we know about early human history. On Wednesday, it happened again. Yohannes Haile-Selassie of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and his colleagues reported finding a jaw in Ethiopia that belonged to an ancient human relative that lived sometime between 3.3 and 3.5 million years ago. They argue that the jaw belongs to an entirely new species, which they named Australopithecus deyiremeda. While some experts agree, skeptics argue that the jaw belongs to a familiar hominid species, known as Australopithecus afarensis, that existed about 3.9 to 3 million years ago. Studies like this one are adding fresh fuel to the debate over the pace of human evolution. Some researchers now believe the human family tree bore exuberant branches early on.

""I'm so excited about these discoveries I'm driving my friends crazy,"" said Carol V. Ward, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Missouri. ""It makes us stop and rethink everything."" In the 1990s, the broad outlines of human evolution seemed fairly clear. Early human ancestors, known as hominids, evolved from an ancestor shared with chimpanzees about six or seven million years ago. These hominids were short, bipedal apes with small brains and arms and legs still adapted for climbing trees. Until about three million years ago, experts thought, there weren't a lot of hominid species. In fact, some researchers argued that most hominid fossils represented just a single species. In 1974, the paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson and his colleagues found a fairly complete, 3.4-million-year-old skeleton in Ethiopia, which they nicknamed Lucy. The species was named Australopithecus afarensis, and many more examples have come to light, dating from about 3.9 to 3 million years ago. Scientists had thought that hominid evolution became more complex just 2.4 million years ago. New species split apart from Australopithecus afarensis, at least a few of them coexisting in Africa.

One lineage, called Paranthropus, evolved powerful jaws it probably used to grind tough plant matter. Other hominids developed nimble hands, which they used to make stone tools for butchering meat. Eventually they evolved into tall, long-distance walkers. These hominids belonged to the genus Homo, which produced our own species about 200,000 years ago. But with new discoveries like Australopithecus deyiremeda, this eons-long story may need to change. Hominids may have become much more diverse much earlier than previously thought. Australopithecus afarensis may have had a lot of company. In 1995, Ronald J. Clarke of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and his colleagues discovered Australopithecus fossils in a South African cave. While the fossils have yet to be formally named, Dr. Clarke and his colleagues have started referring to the putative new species as Australopithecus prometheus. Geologists initially estimated that the rock layer atop the bones was 2.2 million years old. But that research did not tell them exactly how much older the fossils might be. More recently, Dr. Clarke and his colleagues have used new methods to date the rock layer in which the fossils were embedded. In April, they reported that Australopithecus prometheus was 3.67 million years old. Yet another possible contemporary of Australopithecus afarensis lived in Kenya. In 2001, researchers reported the discovery of a flat-faced hominid skull dating back 3.5 million years. They called it Kenyanthropus platyops.

The long, grasping toes appear to have been better suited for tree climbing than those of Australopithecus afarensis, suggesting it belonged to a species of its own. Until scientists can describe more bones from its skeleton, it remains without a species name. These early hominids may have been more mentally sophisticated than previously thought, scientists also have found. Until now, the oldest stone tools ever found dated back 2.6 million years -- about 400,000 years after Australopithecus afarensis became extinct. But last week, Sonia Harmand of Stony Brook University and her colleagues reported discovering tools in Kenya that they estimate to have been made 3.3 million years ago. The researchers suggested that the tools were made by Kenyanthropus, because its fossils come from rocks about the same age and in the same region of Kenya where the tools were found. Dr. Ward, of the University of Missouri, said the evidence gathered so far pointed to a much earlier explosion of hominid diversity. ""It changes our view of human evolution in a fundamental way,"" she said. Four or more species may have coexisted with Australopithecus afarensis. Some may have specialized in different ways of getting food, perhaps with newly developed stone tools, for example. Or they may have competed with one another. The tools also hint that at least some of these early hominids were capable of more complex thinking than previously believed. ""The stone tools represent a sophistication in how they use and manipulate objects,"" Dr. Ward said.

Scientists have also shed new light on the transition from Australopithecus to Homo. In March, Kaye E. Reed of Arizona State University and her colleagues reported finding the oldest Homo fossil, dating back 2.8 million years. It has some anatomical features found only in Homo, such as narrow molars. But it has other traits, like a rounded chin, that make it look more like Australopithecus afarensis. Dr. Ward said scientists now must trace Homo's origins to one of the several hominid species that may have lived between three million and four million years ago -- and figure out why the other species became extinct. But some hominid experts remain unconvinced that the road to Homo took so many turns. Tim D. White, a paleoanthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley, argues that most of the new studies have been rushed into publication without careful peer review. The 3.3-million-year date for the ancient stone tools, for example, ""seemed quite sketchy to me,"" Dr. White said. The tools could have been made hundreds of thousands of years later, he said. Dr. White is also skeptical that the new fossils represent a wealth of new species. He suspects that most of them, including Australopithecus deyiremeda, are just Australopithecus afarensis. ""Lucy's species just got a few more new fossils,"" he said of Wednesday's announcement. The peculiar anatomical quirks described by other scientists are no more unusual than the variations found within living ape species, he said. When scientists discover a fossil, Dr. White warned, it can be easy to blow minor variations out of proportion. ""A piece of a mandible doesn't tell you much,"" he said. ""Whenever you have small samples, you run a very real risk of mischaracterization."""
54884,A Brooklyn Artery in Transition,A new wave of residential development has come to a ragtag stretch of Fourth Avenue that borders Park Slope and Gowanus/Boerum Hill.,"Fourth Avenue, as seen from the roof of the new Landmark Park Slope, is gaining residential development.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/02/realestate/02FOURTH1/02fourth-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=86a10170e983319b5976f85f223d9917c4d1c9a5f324fb6ac31bc503ed1cdbe3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/realestate/a-brooklyn-artery-in-transition.html,4684cc21-c2ab-5625-b2a9-d36cf187bf95.jpg,"The dream of turning Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn into a grand residential boulevard is still just that -- a dream. Even so, residential development along the thoroughfare took off about a decade ago when the area was rezoned, and now, after a recession-induced break, construction has begun again at a somewhat frenzied pace. Once crammed with auto repair shops, parking lots, delicatessens and low-rise walk-ups, parts of the ragtag stretch of Fourth Avenue that borders Park Slope and Gowanus/Boerum Hill are now flanked by apartment towers. And at least seven new development projects, either finished recently or in the works, are bringing several hundred additional rental units to the area. They will be joining the dozen or so high-rises, many of them condominiums, that were built after the rezoning in the early 2000s enabled property developers to build as high as 12 stories in the low-rise neighborhood. Part of the attraction of Fourth Avenue, a traffic-choked truck route that runs from Bay Ridge to Downtown Brooklyn, is excellent access to subway transportation into Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn. But perhaps Fourth Avenue's biggest appeal is its neighbor to the east, Park Slope, a family-oriented, historic community of brownstones that borders Prospect Park and has a popular restaurant row. ""Park Slope has been noted many times as being one of the best neighborhoods in the country,"" said David J. Maundrell III, the president of aptsandlofts.com, a real estate company consulting on several projects along Fourth Avenue, ""so you have this pent-up demand from people who want to live there. But in my opinion, Park Slope is fully built out, and the only place you can develop now is Fourth Avenue, where there's still a lot of opportunity.""

Recently, aptsandlofts.com finished leasing in a 51-unit high-rise at 202 Eighth Street; the agency has only a handful of apartments left in the 104-unit Landmark Park Slope on Sixth Street at Fourth Avenue. The Slate Property Group, a development company, is working on two rental buildings on Fourth Avenue, one with 75 apartments near First Street and the other with 105 apartments near 11th, which should be operational in the next two years. Mr. Maundrell says that another 11-story rental building is going up on Fourth Avenue farther north, near Douglass Street, with about 17 units, and that another rental tower is planned for a site on Sixth Street at Fourth Avenue. The development group Adam America also plans to demolish a McDonald's on Fourth Avenue and First Street and replace it with about 78 high-end rental apartments in an 11-story building. Danny Ghitis for The New York Times Development sites along Fourth Avenue have been changing hands at escalating prices, in a hint that more residential development is in the offing, developers say. In 2011, said Victor Sigoura, the chief investment officer of the Naftali Group, it paid about $100 a square foot for the land under Landmark Park Slope, whereas some land on the Fourth Avenue corridor today is valued around $250 a square foot. Another developer, Tona Construction and Management, has been building on Fourth Avenue for about a decade, and its chief executive, Domenick Tonacchio, said, ""We have a couple of projects on Fourth Avenue, residential rental buildings that we're working on that are in the planning stages right now.""

All the new projects are rental buildings, but development of condos may be imminent, depending on what happens with interest rates. ""The condo market in Brooklyn is just really starting to go,"" Mr. Maundrell said, ""and that's because finally the end-user is willing to pay more than a multifamily investor on a per-unit basis. So people are considering doing condos, but there's also an underlying concern with interest rates."" The new buildings, which are providing mostly smaller apartments, appear to be renting with ease at previously unheard-of prices, even in well-heeled Park Slope. Studios are generally renting for $2,100 to $2,400 a month; one-bedrooms for $2,600 to $3,500; and two-bedrooms from $3,600 to $4,500, he said. The rare three-bedrooms typically lease for about $5,000 to $7,000. Almost a third of the renters in the Landmark were priced out of Manhattan, while the rest came from other parts of Brooklyn, and were overwhelmingly young and single, Mr. Sigoura said. ""There are some families with one, maybe two, children who have taken some of our two-bedroom apartments,"" he said, ""but most have been young professionals."" Eve Taylor, a six-year resident of Park Slope, leased a two-bedroom apartment at the Landmark with her boyfriend last September. Because Gowanus, to the west of Fourth Avenue, is a low-lying, industrial neighborhood, Ms. Taylor said, the roof of the 12-story building has phenomenal 360-degree views not only of Brooklyn, including Prospect Park, but also of Manhattan's skyline. ""We saw the apartment here, and we thought it was really cool and had a lot of potential,"" she said. ""But then we went to the rooftop, and that was when we were like, 'We love this place.' "" Six years ago, Ms. Taylor rented her first apartment in Park Slope with roommates in a walk-up building at Fourth Avenue and Garfield Place, which was all she could afford at the time. The avenue was just starting to transform, as bars like Mission Dolores opened, and glassy condo buildings started going up. ""I always kind of walked along the avenue looking up longingly, thinking how nice it must be to live in such a place,"" she added.

Elise Selinger, a three-year resident of Park Slope living with two roommates in a walk-up off Fourth Avenue, said her landlord had recently notified her that the coming year would be her last in the apartment. ""The landlord is going to renovate and, quote, 'raise the rent substantially,' which will make it cost-prohibitive for three young professional women who make perfectly good money to rent the apartment,"" Ms. Selinger said. ""The price of a one-bedroom in one of the new buildings is equivalent to the price of the three-bedroom we're renting now, and it's more than I bring home in a month."" The growing community along Fourth Avenue bordering Park Slope has voiced discontent with the lack of affordable housing in the area, primarily through a group formed two years ago called the Forth on Fourth Avenue committee. A part of the Park Slope Civic Council, the committee is led by Ms. Selinger, who is a chairwoman, along with S. J. Avery, a Park Slope resident of 27 years who lives just off Fourth Avenue. ""Our attempts have been to bring some attention to Fourth Avenue as a shared space, and a space of interest to the people living adjacent to it,"" Ms. Avery said, ""as opposed to the border that it used to be. There are an increased number of people who are feeling a vested interest in Fourth Avenue."" In a survey the committee is conducting of Fourth Avenue residents, many have described the avenue as unwelcoming and ugly, with new development aggravating the problem. Because the city's original rezoning did not require retail shops at street level, many of the new buildings have blank concrete slabs, giant air vents or parking-garage entrances facing Fourth Avenue. Others have medical groups or doctors' offices, which don't help to generate much foot traffic, Ms. Avery said. A sprinkling of new restaurants, bars and coffee shops have opened along the avenue, but it hasn't become the bustling, pedestrian-friendly ""Park Avenue of Brooklyn"" envisioned by politicians and property developers. The Forth on Fourth committee has taken on tasks such as tree-planting and beautification, and is working with the city's Department of Transportation to make the avenue safer for pedestrians, with wider medians, left-turn restrictions and a reduction to two lanes of traffic in each direction from three. The opening of Whole Foods a block away, on Third Avenue at Third Street, does provide a welcome amenity for Fourth Avenue residents, but it has some worried that the few retailers on Fourth Avenue may soon be priced out of the market, Ms. Avery said. Development pressure is also threatening distinguished buildings along the avenue, like the Pacific branch of the Brooklyn Public Library and the Church of the Redeemer, both of which may be sold and demolished, she said. Ms. Avery said Fourth Avenue residents would like a cleaner, greener avenue with more commerce, to provide a pleasant experience and serve as a destination. ""Sometimes people wrote on their surveys that they deliberately avoid Fourth Avenue when they're walking to the subway,"" she said. ""We'd like people to stop deliberately avoiding Fourth Avenue."""

Fashion profiling played a bigger role in the 2016 American presidential election than anyone realized, according to new information from Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower.

Today at a conference in Britain organized by the fashion industry website The Business of Fashion, Mr. Wylie explained that clothing preferences were a key metric for Cambridge Analytica, whose business was constructing and selling voter profiles drawn from Facebook data.

""Fashion data was used to build AI models to help Steve Bannon build his insurgency and build the alt-right,"" he said.

Preferences in clothing and music are the leading indicators of political leaning, he said. The narratives of the great American brands, which play on the myths of the West and the (mostly male) frontier are also the narratives of the Republican right. Those who choose to spend on the former are susceptible to the latter. He mentioned Wrangler and L.L. Bean in particular as brands that Cambridge Analytica aligned with conservative traits. (Kenzo, by contrast, which is designed by Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, the avant-garde duo behind the retail store Opening Ceremony, appealed to liberals, he suggested.)"
37080,Why Private Equity Is Furious Over a Paper in a Dermatology Journal,"The sudden, unexplained removal of a research paper on private equity firms buying dermatology practices has raised questions about corporate influence.","Dr. Matt Leavitt heads Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery, the largest dermatology practice in the United States, which is backed by private equity. It is one of the practices that objected to the article.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/27/business/27DERMATOLOGY1-print/00DERMATOLOGY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=09c3250425dc55a4a4144749edcc6a3792dc77d7c678ba41f068820fe75a353e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/health/private-equity-dermatology.html,851f88f3-8855-5b61-956d-17dd02800ca4.jpg,"Early this month, a respected medical journal published a research paper on its website that analyzed the effects of a business trend roiling the field of dermatology: the rapid entrance of private equity firms into the specialty by buying and running practices around the country. Eight days later, after an outcry from private equity executives and dermatologists associated with private equity firms, the editor of the publication removed the paper from the site. No reason was given. Furor over the publication and subsequent removal of the article has deepened a rift in the field over what some see as the ""corporatization"" of dermatology and other areas of medicine. [The once sleepy field of dermatology is booming these days. Read our story.] The paper was published on the website of the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology on Oct. 5, posted along with numerous other articles labeled ""In Press Accepted Manuscript."" Most articles with this designation eventually appear in a print edition of the journal; some remain online.

Dr. Dirk Elston, the journal's editor, said in an email that he replaced the article with a notice of ""temporary removal"" after receiving multiple calls and emails ""expressing concerns about the accuracy of a few parts"" of the article. On Wednesday, nearly two weeks after removing the article, Dr. Elston told the authors they had a choice: They could correct ""factual errors"" or retract the paper. The authors maintain that the article does not contain any factual errors and that several of the corrections requested had to do with protecting the reputation of the specialty and the leaders of the American Academy of Dermatology, the association that publishes the journal. Later on Wednesday, they submitted some revisions. The article had gone through the standard editorial process of academic journals, undergoing multiple revisions based on feedback from peer-reviewers selected by the journal, before being accepted for publication. It presents data to support a conclusion that private equity firms acquire ""outlier"" practices -- that is, practices that perform an unusually high number of well-reimbursed procedures and bill high amounts to Medicare. ""It was interesting when we ran the numbers and we were counting how many practices with billing outliers were being acquired by private equity,"" said Dr. Joseph Francis, a dermatologist in Florida who is a co-author on the paper. ""With every revision of the paper, that number kept increasing. So it didn't seem like an anomaly.""

He added, ""It wasn't clear whether these investors realized that the high billing might point to anything irregular. They might have just seen that this was a practice with booming business."" The paper also notes that many practices backed by private equity firms have opened or acquired labs to process pathology specimens, potentially another source of profit. Among those who objected to the article was Dr. George Hruza, the incoming president of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dr. Hruza, whose one-year term as president begins in March, is a dermatologist in Chesterfield, Mo. In 2016 he sold his own dermatology practice to United Skin Specialists, a firm that manages dermatology practices and is backed by private equity. He currently serves on the board of directors of United Skin Specialists, which he said is an unpaid position. Dr. Hruza is not named in the journal article, but he said he is easily identified by the authors' reference to his pending presidency of the academy, and to United Skin Specialists. In an interview, Dr. Hruza said he did not ask that the paper be taken down. He did, however, confirm that he expressed his concerns to Dr. Elston, the editor, after it was posted. Two days later, Dr. Elston removed the paper. A flurry of intense conversations ensued among Dr. Elston; Dr. Hruza; the current academy president, Dr. Suzanne Olbricht; a lawyer for the dermatology academy; and the paper's authors.

""Implying motivation is a stretch,"" he said. Dr. Hruza has asked for specific wording changes to that section of the paper. Among the changes the editor of the journal asked the authors to make was the removal of identifiable references to influential dermatologists, including Dr. Hruza. Interference with a scientific paper from within the ranks of a medical society is highly unusual, say experts in the medical publishing field. The sudden disappearance of the paper has others in the medical publishing world scratching their heads. ""The process of science requires that people be allowed to publish their data as long as it has been reviewed by peers who find it accurate in that moment,"" said Dr. Mitchell Katz, president and chief executive of NYC Health & Hospitals and Deputy Editor of the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. As for corrections, Dr. Katz added, ""usually you would post a correct copy rather than removing a paper for days on end."" Dr. Elston said others who objected to the article included Dr. Darrell Rigel, a prominent dermatologist in New York who is a former president of the academy and whose practice is now owned by Schweiger Dermatology, a private equity-backed practice. Dr. Rigel did not respond to requests for comment. Dermatologists account for one percent of physicians in the United States, but 15 percent of recent private equity acquisitions of medical practices have involved dermatology practices. Other specialties that have attracted private equity investment include orthopedics, radiology, cardiology, urgent care, anesthesiology and ophthalmology.

One of the paper's five supplemental tables lists 32 dermatology practices in the United States that have been formed or acquired by private equity firms. Many are large practices with dozens of physicians. Shortly after the article disappeared from the journal's website, a copy was posted to a Facebook group composed of some 3,500 dermatologists. Several participants in the Facebook group praised the article for shining a light on the effects of private equity on their specialty, and were outraged that the article had been withdrawn. ""If this were an article on psoriasis no one would be questioning it, but this was going to ruffle some feathers,"" said Dr. Curtis Asbury, a dermatologist in Selbyville, Del., and an active participant in the Facebook group. The lead author of the paper was Dr. Sailesh Konda, an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Florida College of Medicine. Dr. Konda, 34, said he first grew interested in the topic when several of his trainees went to work for private equity-backed practices and told him of clinical environments that emphasized profits at the expense of patient care. He said that over the past year he had given 16 talks around the country to medical residents and dermatology societies about private equity. Dr. Francis has joined him for some of the sessions. Dr. Konda said he and his co-authors spent a year working on the paper. After the paper went out for review, he said, ""we received constructive feedback."" Most of the comments, he said, were about maintaining a neutral tone. ""We strived to not use any polemic words, which could be interpreted as bias,"" he said. ""We decided to just deal with the facts, which would speak for themselves."" This week a lawyer for Advanced Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery, which is backed by private equity and is the largest dermatology practice in the United States, called the general counsel at the University of Florida, where two of the authors are employed, demanding specific changes to the paper. The general counsel for the university declined to comment. Dr. Matt Leavitt, the chief executive of Advanced Dermatology, did not respond to requests for a comment. Dr. Konda says he plans to continue his research into private equity. ""I am passionate about this topic,"" he said. ""I realize we live in a capitalist society and money is a driving force behind many decisions regardless of the industry. However, I believe there has to be a balance between profit and patient care."""
22002,Ali Stroker on Winning the Tony: 'I Was Meant to Be in This Seat',"The flirtatious Ado Annie of Broadway's ""Oklahoma!"" says she is proud to be a symbol.",Ms. Stroker at the High Line in New York City on Wednesday.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/13/arts/12stroker-print2/merlin_156351051_374d541e-9e30-4cd4-8285-508cc2e50797-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=8ea85353574fbc98a25117d6a37cf1d8eb904595636cec5e1b8386d104a03a7f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/theater/ali-stroker-oklahoma-tony.html,f1ad8d83-818e-5d2d-b6c0-345cddac628d.jpg,"Ali Stroker on Winning the Tony: 'I Was Meant to Be in This Seat'

High on a shelf in Ali Stroker's Broadway dressing room sits a Barbie in a box. But it's not just any Barbie -- it's a doctored doll, refashioned as a farmgirl in a wheelchair. ""My dresser made it for me,"" said Ms. Stroker, who is starring as the lusty Ado Annie in the Tony-winning revival of ""Oklahoma!"" ""I was so moved by that because I've never had a Barbie that was in a wheelchair, let alone a Barbie that's me. And she was like, 'There should be so many more.'"" Ms. Stroker, 31, made Broadway history Sunday night when she was named best featured actress in a musical, becoming the first performer who uses a wheelchair to win a Tony. She was just two years old when the car in which she was riding swerved to avoid a pile of leaves and collided head-on with another vehicle. Her brother suffered a traumatic brain injury; she suffered a spinal cord injury and was paralyzed from the chest down.

""When I got on stage, it was the first time that I felt powerful,"" Ms. Stroker said, tearily -- to her surprise, she has been crying, a lot, since Sunday, still overwhelmed by a moment that barely seemed possible. ""I was used to people staring at me, but they were staring at me because I was in a wheelchair. And when I was on stage, they were staring at me because I was the star."" She's been acting ever since, and on Sunday she arrived at the Tonys in a bright yellow gown created by Ms. Antonoff, who is now a fashion designer. ""So many times, our society is taught, 'Don't look, don't stare and don't ask -- that would be rude,'"" Ms. Stroker said. ""As an artist, I'm saying, 'Look at me now. Look at my body. Look how I move my chair.' I'm asking, and that makes me feel my most powerful self.""

We talked in her dressing room at Broadway's Circle in the Square theater on Tuesday afternoon, just before her first post-Tonys performance. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. A. It 's in my bag. I needed to have it with me. I just wanted to feel the weight of it. You addressed your acceptance speech to children with disabilities. Why? I just wanted to talk to those kids and say, ""You can do it."" How did you feel about being seated backstage when they were announcing your category? I think I had a dream that maybe there could be a ramp built. It's more than just a logistical thing -- it's saying that you are accepted here, in every part of you. I know that the Tonys did the best that they could, and I know that Radio City did the best they could. I am not naive -- there are a lot of logistical things you have to deal with around buildings that were built a long, long time ago. They did put in a ramp backstage. And I had a seat in the front, but the way the night worked out, I never got to my seat.

When did you realize that this ""Oklahoma!"" was going to be so different from other productions? Once we got into rehearsal, I was like, ""Oh, this is not like most musicals I've ever worked on."" But I believe in the truth, and I think that Daniel (Fish, the director) has been able to bring the truth out of ""Oklahoma!"" It's hard to look at things that are uncomfortable. But the only way to make progress is to feel the discomfort. And that's the same about disability.

What drew you to Ado Annie? She doesn't ever apologize for who she is. She doesn't have any shame about who she is. Her wants, her desires, are so clear. And her desire to explore, through sexuality and relationship , feels so true for me. Her line -- ""How can I be what I ain't?"" -- so many girls need to hear that. So many people need to hear that. Do you ever see people in chairs in the audience for ""Oklahoma!""? I do, and I'm always so excited. The other night two Paralympian wheelchair racers came to the show. And still, for me, seeing me in someone else is a powerful, powerful feeling. Something happens in my heart. I feel a calmness . You've expressed some concern about accessibility at Broadway theaters. What is your concern? These theaters are really old in New York, and they've made the houses accessible for patrons, but the backstages have not been made accessible. If I were to get another show, it would be another conversation about how to make the backstage accessible. Here at Circle in the Square, they put in a chairlift for me, and full ramping so I can get to both sides of the stage, and an accessible bathroom. It's great. It's necessary. And it's time. How do you feel about being a symbol? I feel excited and I feel proud and I hope there are so many more soon. Do you get tired or resentful about answering these questions? No. I know in many ways that this is what I was born to do. When a little baby is injured, you always wonder why. And I think for my parents it's so clear I was meant to be in this seat, to bring my joy, and my light, and my love, to something that a lot of our culture and a lot of our society looks at as just a shame, or a tragedy. I don't think any part of my life is not meant to be. I often think of singers drawing themselves up to full height to belt, but you are demonstrating that that's not necessary.

I wear a brace that supports my core, and I do all my movement from my neck and my shoulders. I sing from my upper back -- these muscles are what I engage to get power to sing. But singing for me is not technical, it's spiritual. It is a cry. It is a source of expression. It is where I don't have limits. I feel like I can fly when I sing . One of the crazy parts about being paralyzed is you have such a specific relationship to your body. You know the parts that you cannot use, you cannot feel. So the parts that you can, sometimes you feel like you have superpowers.

You've talked a lot about people who encouraged you. Who discouraged you? There were definitely people who were like: ""No, this is going to be really hard for you."" ""I don't think you can do this."" Or: ""She can't be a part of this because she's in the chair."" But how much power I give to that in my life is my choice, and I don't want to give any. How do you think this award will affect what's next for you? I hope that it will open more doors. I hope to reach people and remind them that everything is impossible until it's done."

Her repertoire already includes the Grateful Dead's ""Uncle John's Band"" and ""Ho Hey,"" by The Lumineers. ""I'm not a great relaxer,"" she said over breakfast in a midtown Manhattan hotel on a late November morning, dismantling the impressive heap of pancakes that had been placed in front of her.

The company will start a $4.4 million fund to pay current and former employees who were sexually harassed at work.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/18/business/18uber/18uber-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3db7e1dc4fcdabe22f826a6925bcafc3a5307e05362a68bea83d6d9be44cb097&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/technology/uber-settles-eeoc-investigation-workplace-culture.html,d9836025-6e5a-5b28-83a9-e95c187f3b3c.jpg,"""This agreement will hopefully empower women in technology to speak up against sexism in the workplace knowing that their voices can yield meaningful change,"" Ami Sanghvi, an E.E.O.C. trial attorney who consulted on the investigation, said in a statement.

Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, said the company had ""worked hard to ensure that all employees can thrive at Uber by putting fairness and accountability at the heart of who we are and what we do"" and was working with the commission to improve those efforts.

The settlement showed how Uber was addressing the repercussions of its internal conduct more than two years after the envelope-pushing behavior of its executives and employees first came to light.

The company remains under investigation by the Justice Department over a tool it created to help it evade scrutiny by law enforcement authorities. It is also the subject of a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission over its privacy practices until 2038. Last month, the authorities in London said they would not extend the company's license to operate there because Uber did not meet the ""fit and proper"" standard needed to hold a taxi license.

Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, pledged to turn around Uber when he joined the company in late 2017, saying that his motto was ""do the right thing."" He then replaced much of the senior leadership, eliminated a mandatory arbitration provision for sexual assault and harassment claims against the company, and said that executive compensation would be tied to whether or not Uber reached its goals for hiring a more diverse staff."

He was 81 .

His husband, Charles Egita, said the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Mr. Hopkins was famed in the children's book world for championing poetry as well as for the sheer volume of his output. Beginning in the late 1960s he published more than 100 anthologies over a half-century.

There were volumes on particular subjects, about animals, space, inventions, art, punctuation, the different people youngsters were likely to encounter when they began attending school. He drew on writers known mostly within the children's literature universe and on household names like Carl Sandburg, Langston Hughes and E. E. Cummings.

And he wrote poetry himself, often slipping one of his works into the anthologies he edited. For instance, his ""Nasty Bugs,"" a 2012 anthology illustrated by Will Terry, included his own ""Ode to a Dead Mosquito"":

You of little brain

didn't you know

I felt your sting

the instant you

began to drain?

Other books were entirely his poetry, including ""City I Love"" (2009; illustrated by Marcellus Hall). Among the most ambitious of these was ""Been to Yesterdays"" (1995), a series of no-nonsense poems about his early childhood that covered difficult subjects like divorce:

When

Daddy

left us,

he left his

bedroom slippers

beneath the sink

on the bathroom floor.

When

Mama put them

in the giveaway bag

for the poor,

I knew

29259,"Dashboard Confessional, Emo's King of Pain, Rises Again","During the band's break, the genre has experienced a revival and spread into hip-hop. Now Chris Carrabba's band is returning with its first album in nine years.","During the nine years Dashboard Confessional singer and songwriter Chris Carrabba took a break from the band, emo experienced a resurgence.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/04/arts/04DASHBOARD1/04DASHBOARD1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3e126b41d6f7b026a14c2dfb41e2cde2a72079ad54fe221fabe80466c77c1af4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/arts/music/dashboard-confessional-chris-carrabba-crooked-shadows.html,a7e9a348-671b-5b09-92d6-0cd3fd2a19f1.jpg,"In 2009, Dashboard Confessional released what its frontman Chris Carrabba felt might be the band's sixth and final album, ""Alter the Ending,"" a capstone to a decade-long run that saw the band go from emo innovator to genre standard-bearer to elder weathering the end of an era. The group's 2003 album, ""A Mark, a Mission, a Brand, a Scar,"" and ""Dusk and Summer,"" from 2006, both went to No. 2 on the Billboard 200, perhaps the symbolic peak of emo's pop breakthrough. Mr. Carrabba's songs -- scarred wails pulsing with nervy punk energy -- were among the genre's most recognizable, but all that wailing took its toll. By the time of ""Alter the Ending,"" Mr. Carrabba was tired, and the scene he'd helped build had seemingly run its course. In the down years, Mr. Carrabba, 42, worked on outside projects including the bands Twin Forks and Further Seems Forever. But a few years ago, emo began to experience a revival. Younger bands embraced him as a touchstone. Some, like nothing,nowhere., asked for collaborations, bringing Mr. Carrabba into a modern sound that built a hip-hop hybrid on his emo foundation. The zeitgeist has come full circle, and on Feb. 9, Dashboard Confessional will release ""Crooked Shadows,"" its seventh album and first since 2009.

Last month, Mr. Carrabba spent a quiet evening at the Palm steakhouse in Manhattan, where he ordered fish and spinach. His hair was swept back with pomade, as it long has been, and he was wearing a hoodie advertising a Bethlehem, Pa., bakery called Vegan Treats. He was contemplative. Over three hours he talked about retreating from the spotlight, the persistence of emo and accusations of sexual assault that have roiled the genre. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Is Dashboard Confessional a specific mood, or a sound? When you write a song, how do you know it's a Dashboard song? It's the elusive nature of it, which in this case caused a seven- or eight-year delay between records. That it comes from some mysterious place is a little bit of an overstatement. That it comes at unpredictable times is probably the better way to place it. So it's almost like... ""It's cominnnng?"" Yes, yes, it is. An unrelenting urge that sends me in a metaphorical dead sprint for a guitar. It's coming on and I've just got seconds to catch it, or it's gone.

Did that pose a problem when Dashboard reunited: ""O.K., we're ready as a band. The fans are ready. But, is the thing ready?"" Yes, and it wasn't. If you were to have been my accountant at that time, you would say there might never be a better time than right this minute to release a record, but it just doesn't work for me that way. So the waiting game began. We did our tour and a year passed. I wrote, like, snippets and then I would stop. I'd physically stop. I put the pencil and the paper down and said, ""Stop it. You're just eager, you're eager to deliver."" Then one day off tour I woke up one morning and I walked downstairs and I wrote a song, and it was evident from the first melodic idea that this was a Dashboard song. And the next morning I woke up and I bolted for my guitar. I realized, ""I'm there."" After all that time I'd begun to wonder if they'd ever come back, and when they came back they came back in rapid succession. The whole thing was a cavalcade and I just surrendered to it. If they hadn't come and you just continued playing your back catalog in amphitheaters, would you have felt that something was missing? No. I had decided that the worst thing that could happen was that I write an album that would hurt the legacy of the albums I'd made already. But now that I have this record, I can say it's because I've gotten in touch with that place again and there was more to be found there and I'm willing to risk the whole legacy because it came from the same place.

When someone like Joe Mulherin from nothing,nowhere. says there's a home for you in what he does, does it make you feel the zeitgeist has come back around? I feel like it's emblematic of the concurrent paths we happen to be on. I haven't stopped being an excessive consumer of music, old and new. There's nothing better -- or frankly, worse -- than I wish I had written that lyric. Phoebe Bridgers, she's the real deal. Dawes have that lyric which I think might be the most romantic thing ever said in a song if the listener that hears it is a massive music fan: ""May all your favorite bands stay together."" Those are the moments I'm looking for. And with Joe, he's got a mountain of them. Phoebe's got a mountain of them. Julien [Baker]'s got a mountain of them. I love that other people's songs can make me say, how much deeper can I go? You don't really talk about your personal life, but you are married. You've been married to the same person all these years? Yeah. My wife and I have navigated this really well. She's interesting and she loves me and she cherishes our relationship but she doesn't need me. She is self-actualized. She's a strong enough woman to handle the rigors of distance. If anything it was a difficult thing to navigate coming off the road.

I feel like on this album I heard the word ""we"" more than on previous records. I did, too, and I didn't know it until the record was done. Maybe this is a naive or oversimplified way of talking about Dashboard records, but I experience them as ""I,"" not ""we"" records. Well, I was navigating the world by myself at that moment when I was writing most of the Dashboard songs. I'm now not only navigating the world with my wife, but I'm looking back, I'm holding on fiercely to what I realize is so rare with this really strong circle of friends that I've been lucky enough to have. Previously, I was at a point where I thought I was going through things alone. Now I've just been in a place where I'm no more certain about anything that life's handed me and the reasons for it, but I've never been less alone.

Have you come across any of the feminist reassessments of emo -- stories about how women were marginalized in the scene as participants and also how the music often reduced them to objects? I would say that I was never really that satisfied with the limited amount of women that were in the scene. Two of my favorite bands, Jejune and Rainer Maria, had women coleads. And I had women singing on all my records. But I'm not deaf. A lot of the bands that followed our era, they were like degraded copies every six months, where I and everybody thought it was almost like hair metal or something like that, costumes some of them put on. And the stories and the feelings beneath them were incidental. I didn't relate to that. I think at that point it got pretty much, like, by the numbers and it was like, ""O.K., you pick on a girl.""

Did you reject it in the moment? Yeah. I felt like it was gross. I thought it was opportunistic. I thought it was degrading. Were there bands you wouldn't tour with? Yes. And it bummed me out and it broke my heart a little. And in that time, beforehand but especially once I started to notice it, I made a rule of trying as often as possible to have a female-led band or a band with a woman in the band on tour with us. You toured with Brand New. What was your reaction to the allegations against Jesse Lacey? [In November, the singer was accused of sexual improprieties by a woman who said he solicited nude pictures from her when she was a minor. He released a statement apologizing for his behavior without directly addressing the allegation. No charges have been filed.] I think it is abhorrent, shocking. Were you surprised by it? I was surprised by it, because in this case, I never saw anything that would indicate that. I haven't spoken to Jesse about it, as we haven't really spoken that much in years. As part of the scene -- I don't mean outside of it being a band they looked up to, I mean being one of the kids in it -- I don't know how to not be offended by it. First, I was a fan in that scene, then I was somebody that people were fans of. I remained a fan in that scene too. We had a trust. There was a morality to it. I felt that's what made us different than other scenes. We were the answer to the rock 'n' roll cliche, I thought. Have these topics been an active subject of conversation between you and your peers? Well, between me and my friends.

What about people who are in the scene in some form or another? No, it seems uncomfortable when I've tried to talk to some of them about this. They seem as concerned, but I think that nobody knows how to come to grips with the idea that our scene was a place that something like this could happen. It's shameful. I don't want to believe that my part of the circle of fans were treated that way or felt that way at shows. I feel like we're there to take care of each other. That's what the ethics of a scene really should be. Like if I see a fight break out, I'll stop the show and say, ""Stop the fight. Is everyone O.K.?"" It's our responsibility -- not just the bands, anybody that's proactive in the scene -- it's our collective responsibility to say, in all situations, ""Are you O.K.?"" I just didn't know I had to say it about this stuff. I didn't know."

Over the last few years, the Philadelphia Museum of Art has trumpeted a major $228 million renovation, designed by the architect Frank Gehry, that is to be completed next fall. But over the last several months, the 144-year-old institution has been forced to undergo an overhaul of a very different kind. Complaints that a manager, Joshua Helmer, had made advances toward multiple female employees during his tenure and that museum officials failed to respond to the women appropriately, have led to weeks of reckoning between the institution and its staff. Mr. Helmer's quiet resignation in 2018 seems to have done little to quell staff frustration. Since the complaints against him surfaced publicly in January, more than 400 current and former staff members have signed a letter calling for greater accountability and structural change at the museum. Some come to work each day wearing ""We Believe Women"" buttons.

""As someone who has worked at the museum for 20 years, I know they need to finish the renovation,"" said Ah-Young Kim, a manager in the education department. ""But can you imagine opening more galleries for programming and exhibitions when the staff is so defeated?"" The museum has sought to gain control of the situation, embarking on a staff-wide listening tour, commissioning a consultant to conduct a ""cultural assessment"" of the workplace and creating an anonymous hotline for reporting human resources-related violations or concerns. ""The museum is taking it really seriously,"" said H. Richard Dietrich III, a trustee, who declined to comment further. Still, there have been hitches. Only last month the museum had to answer for the behavior of yet another former executive, James A. Cincotta, who as retail director was said to have physically and verbally abused employees according to a report in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Mr. Cincotta did not respond to messages requesting comment.

These are not the sort of images usually associated with one of America's oldest and most esteemed institutions. But they have become emblematic of the wider cultural discussion -- fueled by the #MuseumMeToo moment -- that art institutions have been forced to undertake as pressures build to reform their workplaces. ""Every institution I know is thinking very seriously about standards of personal and professional conduct,"" said Gary Tinterow, director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. ""Meaningful conversations are happening everywhere."" Parts of the conversation in Philadelphia are being directed by VallotKarp, a consulting firm the museum has hired to perform the ""cultural assessment."" That assessment is to include an advisory team of 12 to 15 staff members, an optional survey, interviews and a focus group. On Jan. 17, Leslie Anne Miller, the museum's chairwoman, sent an email to staff members saying she would lead the assessment, which will include ""reviewing existing policies and procedures and ensuring tangible, actionable and transparent results and recommended next steps."" ""We are working diligently and as quickly as we can to be responsive,"" she added in the email. ""However, we must balance quick action with the importance of being thoughtful and deliberate to be sure we are hearing and understanding all of your concerns.""

VallotKarp also explained the process at a staff-wide meeting that the museum held one day last month before the doors opened, thinking the early hour would enable most employees to attend. ""The meeting was extremely emotional but not well-attended,"" Ms. Kim said. ""It was held at 8:45 a.m. on a Friday, which was difficult for people with children or part-time jobs to attend because of the time. It was also difficult for the rest of the staff because it's a day when many of us are expected to work later since the museum stays open until 8:45 p.m."" Administrators have also retained Aorta, the Anti-Oppression Resource and Training Alliance, which has been meeting with small groups of employees who have confidentially shared their workplace experiences. This kind of turmoil is not typically good for a museum leader, in this case Timothy Rub, who has been director since 2009. In memos to the staff, Mr. Rub has acknowledged ""mistakes"" and apologized for the handling of the Helmer incidents. He apologized again when the accusations surfaced about Mr. Cincotta. He has met with every department at the museum on a listening tour and held a town-hall meeting in late January.

""I'm not sure this is coming from the right place,"" said Brandon Straus, an audiovisual technician at the museum. ""Maybe they will change their tactics from sweeping things under the rug. But what is their motivation? Protecting themselves or their employees?"" ""Why should a cultural assessment have a bigger impact than our stories to human resources, the administration and the media?"" he added. Asked if Mr. Rub would comment for this article, a spokesman for the museum, Norman Keyes, said in an email: ""At the moment the feeling here is to hold off on interviews with Timothy until after the work of the culture assessment is completed."" Many trustees did not respond to interview requests, but there has been no indication that Mr. Rub has lost the support of the museum's board. In January, Mr. Helmer was forced to resign from his subsequent position as director of the Erie Museum of Art in Pennsylvania, where a female employee also complained of his conduct. Before his departure, the Erie museum said it had investigated the complaint and found no reason to discipline Mr. Helmer. He has denied any misconduct and defended his behavior as appropriate. In Philadelphia, political pressure on the museum increased after the complaints regarding Mr. Helmer became public. Government leaders, including Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, called on the museum to strengthen its policies regarding sexual harassment.

This type of negative attention is exactly what a museum does not want in the middle of a major capital campaign (its goal is $525 million, with $473 million raised so far). The museum says fund-raising remains on pace. But some donors have asked for explanations of recent events, according to people in the development office, who were provided suggested talking points in the event they faced questions from patrons. ""The museum is undertaking a range of thoughtful and deliberate actions,"" one talking point began, ""to result in a safer, stronger and more unified work environment."" In one bright spot, employees say that weathering the controversy has fostered solidarity among those looking to improve their workplace. ""Our departments used to be siloed and we didn't know each other,"" said an education staff member. ""But that's not true anymore. We talk and support each other."" ""It's giving many of us a lot of hope that something positive is coming out of this,"" she added.Other employees have decided that their time at the institution is over. Marla Shoemaker, who had been Mr. Helmer's direct supervisor, retired last month. She declined to discuss her reasoning beyond saying it was her decision to leave after 47 years. ""I adore the Philadelphia Museum of Art,"" she said, before adding, ""I can see it's in deep trouble now. It makes me sad."""

Sillerman in the gift shop at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis. Mr. Sillerman gained control of the Presley estate.





Robert F.X. Sillerman, an investor and media executive who built and sold radio empires, controlled the Elvis Presley estate and consolidated the American concert industry, died on Sunday. He was 71 . His brother, Michael, confirmed his death but gave no other details. Mr. Sillerman had recently been living in Hinsdale, N.H. For decades, Mr. Sillerman was a regular in the headlines of the financial press, buying and selling numerous media and entertainment businesses, often at a huge profit, and presenting a brash public persona that sometimes rivaled those of the celebrities he dealt with. When Mr. Sillerman tried to corner the fractious world of dance music festivals in the early 2010s, for example, he played the part of a devil-may-care rebel to a sometimes puzzling extent. He posed for publicity photos in clothes emblazoned with profanities, and after a video of Mr. Sillerman making an obscene gesture circulated on social media, a Wall Street analyst was prompted to question his sanity. Mr. Sillerman called it an inside joke.

But for years he had maintained a golden touch in building media franchises and extracting maximum value from them. Starting in the late 1970s, Mr. Sillerman built a portfolio of radio and television stations worth nearly $1 billion. In 1993 he founded SFX Broadcasting with a partner, R. Steven Hicks. Helped by federal deregulation of radio ownership rules, the two were able to quickly amass a chain of more than 70 stations, which they sold in 1997 to a larger rival, Capstar Broadcasting, for $2.1 billion. By that time Mr. Sillerman had turned his sights on another industry ripe for consolidation: the nationwide concert circuit, which had long remained a loosely connected network of venues and promoters who operated regional fiefs. Over a few years in the late 1990s, Mr. Sillerman and his new company, SFX Entertainment, spent more than $2 billion acquiring dozens of promoters and venues, creating the concert world's first truly national force. A crucial part of his strategy was using the nationwide audience at SFX's shows to lure sponsorship deals by big consumer brands like Smirnoff and Levi's. ""We want to make money both by selling tickets and by putting a live audience in front of Madison Avenue,"" he said in an interview in 1998.

In 2000, the radio chain Clear Channel Communications bought SFX for $4.4 billion . Five years later, Clear Channel spun off those concert assets into a separate company, Live Nation, which in 2010 merged with Ticketmaster to become Live Nation Entertainment, the biggest concert promoter in the world. Robert Franklin Sillerman was born in Manhattan on April 12, 1948, to Michael McKinley Sillerman, a radio and television executive, and Estelle (Levande) Sillerman. Robert, who grew up in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, was born on the third anniversary of the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his original middle name was a tribute to the former president. Mr. Sillerman's marketing talents emerged early. As a teenager he started his own greeting card company, buying cards in bulk and enlisting youngsters to sell them. While attending Brandeis University, he founded Youth Market Consultants, which sold magazine subscriptions to students and in turn advised companies on how to reach that market. He graduated from Brandeis in 1969 and, three years later, sold Youth Marketing Consultants to Ingalls, an advertising firm in Boston. At Ingalls he met a young copywriter, Laura Baudo, who would become his wife. In addition to Mr. Sillerman's brother, Ms. Baudo Sillerman survives him. Their daughter, Mackinley , died in 2012.

By the time Mr. Sillerman began buying radio stations in the late 1970s, he was using a new name: Robert F.X. Sillerman. He often named his companies using some combination of those initials. After selling SFX Entertainment, Mr. Sillerman pursued various entertainment projects. He was one of the producers of ""The Producers,"" the Broadway hit, written by his friend Mel Brooks, that ran for six years and pushed the limits of ticket prices on Broadway. He also acquired a majority of the Presley estate , with the right to operate Graceland, the Presley home in Memphis; took over the company behind the long-running television hit ""American Idol""; and acquired the rights to Muhammad Ali's name and likeness. But Mr. Sillerman's success ran out in recent years when he tried to repeat his concert model with a new version of SFX Entertainment, this time going after electronic dance music, or EDM -- a bull market in 2012, when Mr. Sillerman opened the company with a $1 billion war chest. At first, advertisers and investors flocked to the new SFX. But the company's performance was weak, and its stock price eventually plunged by more than 95 percent. It declared bankruptcy in 2016, and many of the assets it had amassed were sold off. Mr. Sillerman largely withdrew in recent years, moving to New Hampshire and dealing with the fallout from the collapse of several businesses. This year, he agreed to pay a $179,000 fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission for defrauding investors of another of his companies, Function(x). But in making his push for the new version of SFX in 2012, he spoke with boundless optimism about the potential for his new company. ""I'm also confident that we will create a better experience for the fans,"" Mr. Sillerman said in an interview with The New York Times. ""Can we monetize that? If we can, this will dwarf the first SFX. That's the whole game."""

In Jen's AutoAmerica, almost all of the jobs have been automated and rising seas have swamped large sections of the country. The privileged, known as the ""Netted,"" have ""angelfair"" skin and live on high ground, while the ""Surplus,"" whose skin is often ""coppertoned,"" suffer on swampland and rickety houseboats. This intricately imagined novel is ostensibly set in the near future, though it sometimes reads less like prophecy and more like present-day journalism. Here, ""Surplus"" people whose jobs have been replaced and who are deemed ""Unretrainable"" survive on meager basic incomes. They are pressured to consume ""mall-truck food,"" which may or may not contain ""winnowing agents"" meant to gradually eliminate the surplus population altogether. They also live with the constant threat of being ""Cast Off"" for infractions against the state, their boats let loose into the stormy open ocean. Meanwhile, much of everyday life is controlled by something called ""the Autonet,"" a creepy marriage of the internet, A.I., surveillance technology and the radio announcements that emanate from the walls inside North Korean houses. ""Of course, you have a choice. You always have a choice,"" is the Autonet's refrain. Orwell's ""Big Brother"" here becomes ""Aunt Nettie,"" an allusion also to the supervising ""aunts"" of Margaret Atwood's ""The Handmaid's Tale."" ""Aunt Nettie"" functions as a kind of authoritarian government, but no one seems to know if there are any humans behind it.

At the center of Jen's inventive novel is a Surplus family of resisters. Grant, the narrator, is a former professor who spends much of his time trying to outwit the various drones and other devices that constantly monitor his family. Grant's wife, Eleanor, is a brilliant lawyer and cult figure who lives among the Surplus by choice, waging legal battles against the powers that be, driven by the idea that ""right makes might."" (A court system does remain in this society, but it is largely presided over by ""autojudges."") Together, Eleanor, Grant and their only child, Gwen, practice a variety of endearingly anachronistic and possibly illegal activities: gardening, knitting sweaters, reading novels, and -- most unexpectedly -- playing baseball. ""The Resisters"" might be the only dystopian novel whose climax involves a tense, high-stakes baseball game. The story is driven by young Gwen's development as a pitching prodigy. At first, she plays only in an underground baseball league that her parents organize, illegal because it distracts the Surplus population from their responsibility to consume. To play in the league, players must hack the implanted microchips that otherwise track their movements. Gwen's prodigious pitching talent eventually allows her to ""cross over"" into the world of the Netted, as a freshman on the baseball team at Net U. Here, people are less visibly surveilled and more likely to self-censor than be censored. The Netted remain conveniently ignorant of the suffering of the Surplus, inspiring one character to say, ""The very definition of the Netted is people who see nothing."" For Gwen, the stakes rise exponentially when AutoAmerica's Cold War-like rival, ChinRussia, begins training a baseball team for the Olympics, and Aunt Nettie decides that the country's success at baseball carries geopolitical importance. Gwen is soon pressured to undergo ""GenetImprovement,"" a form of genetic engineering that makes doping seem minor. But in the tradition of her resister parents, Gwen refuses, borrowing the famous line from Herman Melville's ""Bartleby the Scrivener"": ""I'd prefer not to."" For this and other acts of resistance, Gwen and her family face grim punishment.

The power of speculative fiction often lies in its ability to make us look at the world around us with fresh eyes. Mundane acts have a way of becoming extraordinarily beautiful when we are faced with the prospect of their vanishing. Here, baseball becomes a site of resistance, an emblem of humanity, an antidote to the automation and artificial intelligence that controls every other aspect of life in AutoAmerica. After all, what would be the point of automating such a thing as nine human players throwing and catching balls to the best of their physical abilities? What significance could there possibly be in a robot pitching a perfect game? ""We are here,"" one coach says late in the novel, ""because we believe anything can happen in a ballgame. ... You can get a guy and all his stats but give him a stick to swing, and you still don't know what will happen."" It's a marvelously refreshing concept in a world that is otherwise dominated by algorithms. ""The Resisters"" is a book that grows directly out of the soil of our current political moment, and much of the book's unsettling pleasure lies in Jen's ingenious extrapolation (or, in some cases, redescription) of contemporary problems. The book brims with ""EnforceBots"" (police robots), ""ThoughtCommand"" (next-level voice command), ""PermaDerms"" (permanent skin whitening) and ""SmartGuns."" AutoAmerica is a nation shaped by policies like ""Ship'EmBack,"" a mass deportation of immigrants, and the ""One Chance Policy,"" wherein Surplus families are permitted only one pregnancy, no matter the outcome. Jen has such a gifted ear for the manipulative languages of tech, marketing and government that at times the sheer abundance of clever details threatens to overwhelm the stories of her characters. But perhaps this overabundance is part of the novel's method, a way of swallowing the characters and the reader into AutoAmerica's reality. ""The Resisters"" is aimed at many catastrophes at once: surveillance technology, government overreach, authoritarianism, automation, economic inequality, racism, sexual assault and the institutional mishandling of it, geopolitical conflict and climate change. The central thread of the book, though, or perhaps the most lingering, is its obsession with the threats of artificial intelligence. ""The Resisters"" is full of characters who voluntarily hand over their humanity -- by agreeing to GenetImprovement or by mindlessly following the orders of Aunt Nettie. In one unnerving section, the narrator recounts the incremental steps that led to this all-encompassing control -- first, he let Aunt Nettie keep his calendar, then respond to emails on his behalf. (""The Resisters"" might make you stop and actually read your user agreements.) In the most devastating moment of this ultimately quite tender novel, one character's mind is surgically merged -- against her will -- with Aunt Nettie, so that the line between human and internet is no longer clear, even to herself. Crucially, it is other human beings who carry out this dreadful procedure, which suggests that even in a dystopian world dominated by artificial intelligence, people are still the ones who carry out the most atrocious acts. We live in a moment when ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is a hit television show, and Kellyanne Conway's use of the term ""alternative facts"" reminded so many readers of the double talk in George Orwell's classic ""1984"" that the novel hit the best-seller list seven decades after its original publication. The public seems to feel that the worst speculative fictions are coming true. Of course, Margaret Atwood would contend that ""The Handmaid's Tale"" was true even as it was written. Perhaps Gish Jen could make a similar argument about much of ""The Resisters."" The hope she offers, though, lies in the book's title, and in the heroism of its family of Bartlebys, who resist both the lure of conveniences and the threats of the powerful, with one phrase: I would prefer not to."

""We'll take what we can carry/And we'll leave the rest,"" Bruce Springsteen vows in his gospel-rooted ""Land of Hope and Dreams,"" embarking on a train journey ""through fields where sunlight streams."" Sometimes his guitar strumming is the train charging ahead; sometimes it's the quiet accompaniment to private, life-changing decisions. The song is the first release from the just-announced live album (and coming Netflix special) ""Springsteen on Broadway,"" and perhaps it arrives now, on the eve of a bitter election, as a reminder of immigrants' positive aspirations.

The last truly effervescent pop star takes the misery of getting left behind and morphs it into fine cotton candy. ""Party for One"" is modest-scaled and concise. Carly Rae Jepsen isn't a vocal powerhouse, so she finds melodies that ask only that she be persistent and bright. ""Tried to let it go and say I'm over you,"" she sings, then adds, with a sad purr, ""I'm not oooover you."" In the video, she and several others chart their own paths of solitude in adjoining hotel rooms, until an emergency forces them all into the lobby. There, for a moment at least, they find companionship: What's more relatable than being alone? JON CARAMANICA

In 1981, the English synth-pop group Heaven 17 greeted the ascent of Ronald Reagan and Britain's far-right National Front with ""(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang,"" warning about ""Evil men with racist views/Spreading all across the land."" Reviving the song just before the midterms, LCD Soundsystem makes it bristle even more: hollowing out hollows out the midrange, cranking up a nervy ratcheting rhythm guitar, pushing synthesizer distortion into the chorus and simply exchanging ""Reagan"" for ""the orange one"" in the lyrics. PARELES

In the battle of Migos solo albums, Takeoff's ""The Last Rocket"" is a far more direct and clear full-length statement than Quavo's ""Quavo Huncho,"" released just a couple of weeks ago. Which is surprising only in so much as Takeoff is the group's utility player and its ballast -- rarely is he allowed the full spotlight. ""Vacation"" is one of his album's high points, a song with a sense of humor and modern flair, while being grounded in the committed grime of late-90s Southern rap. CARAMANICA

The songs Maggie Roche (1951-2017) wrote to sing with her sisters, Suzzy and Terre, as the Roches and on her own sidestepped categories the way they evaded pop symmetries. ""Lose it or abuse it/the public will refuse it,"" she decided in this unreleased demo from a profound posthumous collection, ""Where Do I Come From."" Her songs were acoustic but not folk music, deeply personal but not introverted, amusing but deeply barbed and too subtle for mass popularity, even as they deeply reached many listeners. ""Stayin' Home"" juggles pop ambition against its obstacles -- and, in one verse, some sexual harassment -- and concludes with a couplet only she could conceive: ""You've got a lot of talent but you don't know how to use it/You ought to go into country music."" PARELES

Mingus tended to walk his bass like it was a big, excited, possibly dangerous dog. That's the case on this late-career live performance of ""Dizzy Profile,"" a rare original ballad never recorded for studio release. But he's also straight-on, almost droll. Here he's playing in February 1973 at Detroit's small Strata Concert Gallery, in a quintet that includes the standout pianist Don Pullen and the tenor saxophonist John Stubblefield (recordings from these shows are being released in a five-disc set). It sounds like he's playing up the contrast between the ballad's classic 1950s warmth and his tougher, Vietnam-era surroundings. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

There isn't a category of music more condescending than so-called children's music. It presumes young people lack imagination, that they largely comprehend music as educational, that their interests are circumscribed and almost unrelentingly twee. But if the internet has taught us anything, it's that the minds of young people are active and unexpectedly shaped, and that their desire for self-expression is limitless. And so here is 13-year-old Matt Ox, product of 10,000 SoundCloud links, delivering a new album, ""OX,"" that's utterly plausible as contemporary hip-hop. Like any curious child, he has absorbed the lingo, patterns, attitude and eccentricities of his heroes. Through a quirk of internet fate last year, he rocketed from observer to participant and peer. And now he's rapping alongside the elegantly quirky Valee, delivering high-quality simulacrum with a young-boy twist: Get a bag! I heard you already 30

And it's so sad! 'Cause I already made what you ain't earnin'

Started to stack, when my mama stopped giving me money

Stopped doing allowance, 'cause that was little cash to me This is how children can be: cocky, preposterous, sometimes a little mean. They are omnivorous, and they are inventing themselves in real time. CARAMANICA"

The history of postwar American abstract painting remains a work in progress. We are barely beginning to understand its sheer multiplicity in terms of the artists' races and cultures and the works' physical character. New information arrives in regular and humbling batches. The latest is Joe Overstreet's stunning exhibition ""Innovation of Flight, Paintings 1967-1972"" at Eric Firestone. With 20 rarely seen works, it covers a brief period when Mr. Overstreet's disavowal of painting's usual standards and practices was unfolding rapidly in several directions, alongside efforts by Sam Gilliam, Harmony Hammond, Alan Shields and Howardena Pindell, among others.

Of central importance was Mr. Overstreet's jettisoning of traditional stretcher bars, anchoring his work -- to walls, ceilings, floors or a mix thereof -- with thin rope, metal eyes and handsome knots. As the show's subtitle suggests, evoking lightness and levitation was clearly a goal; some paintings here seem ready for takeoff. Another goal: giving equal prominence to how he painted and what he painted on. Sources and inspirations seem to include Jackson Pollock, Jules Olitski, African textiles, American Indian symbols and things nautical. All together, the pieces deviate wildly in technique, combining stain, hard-edge and shaped painting. Stretched taut, carefully draped or seemingly suspended, these structures evoke tents, gliders, banners and even spaceships and maps. But these suggestions are all tempered by Mr. Overstreet's brilliant use of color and process, and by beauty. An early example that uses stretchers is ""North Star"" (1968), whose crackling bands of color involve both hard-edge and stain painting and whose rectangular shape is transgressed by numerous notches, as well as by two cutout squares, so that it resembles a large mask. ""For Happiness"" (1970) also combines multiple painting techniques; it has 13 ropes that jauntily tilt its surface back and forth in space, challenging understanding of the piece as a whole.

Their radiant, asymmetrical geometries are reminiscent of everything from semaphore and hot-air balloons to tantric painting and the early Modernist works of the married artists Sonia Delaunay and Robert Delaunay. In several works from 1972, Mr. Overstreet switches to an explosive, staccato drip technique, whose intimations of starry skies are regularly contradicted by dividing lines or added segments of canvas, leaving us suspended between deep space and eccentric objects. I look forward to seeing these exuberant, groundbreaking creations becoming standard in museums and new art histories. ROBERTA SMITH

The ready-made, an industrially manufactured object repurposed as art, was popular in the 20th century. But could there be such a thing as ready-made photography? Jared Bark could be said to have found it in his ""Photobooth Pieces"" at Yancey Richardson. Mostly created between 1972 and 1975, these arrangements turn the strips of four photographs that were made in booth machines into artful grids. Mr. Bark made his first work of this sort in Times Square in 1969. After that, he traveled around the country, asking people at Woolworth's drugstores to step inside the machines and pose. (He also acquired his own booth in 1972.) The resulting portrait grids, with their serial repetition of images, contain elements of Minimalism and Pop Art, as well as of the filmic realism of '70s auteur directors like Robert Altman. The range of humanity on display here is also impressive -- particularly when compared with that of similar projects, like Andy Warhol's photo booth works -- as people of all ages and ethnicities appear in photos taken in, for instance, Phoenix or Provo, Utah.

It took Zoe Pettijohn Schade as long as a year and a half to make each of the intricate large gouaches in ""Shifting Sets,"" a show lining the walls of Kai Matsumiya's tidy Stanton Street gallery. Weirdly timeless meditations on death, they simultaneously evoke cutting-edge Photoshop effects and rococo wallpaper, with tiled and overlapping imagery that includes skulls from the Parisian catacombs; toy army men in marbleized silhouette; and delicate, color-graded pigeon feathers modeled on one blackening example the artist found in her garden. What's most fascinating, though, isn't the pieces' nominal content so much as the seeming evanescence of the labor that went into them: If you lean in close, you can see every semi-opaque brush stroke in every pale gray feather, but from any greater distance, such small evidences of the artist's time and attention disappear in the overall dazzle. The same kind of visual dynamic flickers across the whole of ""Crowd of Crowds: 100th Monkey"" (2017), which is covered in diagonal rows of grimacing, long-tailed primates. Because some of them are ghostly gray, and others mere silhouettes filled in with more feathers, skulls, or tombstones, it can take minutes of staring to notice just how simple the pattern is.

Contemporary art has been experiencing a ceramics renaissance for several years now, though its full breadth remains underexplored by galleries and museums. ""Clay Today,"" a new exhibition at the Hole, provides a welcome, if not rigorous, introduction to the utterly creative and clever ways that artists are using this material. The exhibition opens with a showstopper near the entrance: Francesca DiMattio's ""Boucherouite IV"" (2017), a blue-and-white human-size figure of sorts, whose body is a technical marvel of zigzagging rows of clay fringe. Bulging with appendages, ""Boucherouite"" incorporates items like a flowered porcelain handle and a Delftware vessel. Traditional ceramics have not been completely abandoned, but rather overtaken by experimentation. This feeling is echoed in Trevor Baird's vases adorned with panels of comics, and in Rebecca Morgan's gorgeously goofy face jugs. Allison Schulnik's ""Rutile Pink Unicorn Vessel"" (2017) is a simple, oversize urn whose surface is teeming with miniature versions of the title creature. In other places, clay looks a lot like something else, as in Diana Rojas's riff on a retail display of shoes. The most compelling of such works hang on the wall: Valerie Hegarty, Thomas Mailaender and Jesse Edwards have turned ceramics into imitations of paintings, photographs and TV sets, with the objects getting flatter as the illusionistic space deepens. In the show's most exciting art, firm reference points slip away. Two pieces by Shinichi Sawada recall the ritual objects of a lost society. Heidi Lau's ""Seventh and Eighth Level of Hell"" (2018) evokes an alien, ominous world that incorporates elements of our own.

45091,A Visit to Italian Villages That Inspired the Term 'Riviera',"Liguria is a place of unvarnished beauty, where the draw is the simplicity of its timeless way of life.","The port of Imperia, Liguria, Italy",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/travel/08liguria4/08liguria4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=eeb88208e8d9078fc0014d242fc986bb598ba2f730e8c865aaf8140ecadd1c8a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/travel/liguria-italy-mediterranean.html,5aced436-96f5-5ce1-a7c6-d2281113c6ea.jpg,"Finale Ligure, a sun-baked town at the edge of the Ligurian Sea, has no symphony orchestra or opera house. But it has a maestro of its own: Franco Morasca, the manager of Bagni Est Finale, a no-frills, private club on the beach that pulls in generations of Italians each summer for a reminder of what it means to be Italian. The term ""Riviera"" was born on this region, on this crescent-shaped stretch of coast known as Liguria, which runs from the ancient town of Ventimiglia, just over the border from France, through better-known destinations such as San Remo, as well as casual beach spots like Imperia and Finale Ligure. And just inland are some tremendously appealing mountain towns like Borgomaro and Apricale. What unifies each of these destinations is the unpretentious collection of bons vivants who descend on them annually, many of them from Milan, who embrace traditions and a family-centered way of life that still predominates here.

There is a magic at Bagni Est Finale, held together by Mr. Morasca and his sister, who work out of a shoe-boxed sized office overlooking the beach club, a perch from which they have watched young children turn into teenagers, then adults, then parents themselves, as they bring their own children back to be part of the extended family that comes back here each year. I found myself remembering that now-ancient Garry Marshall film (starring Matt Dillon), named ""The Flamingo Kid,"" about a Brooklyn beach club in the 1960s. Except the clock stopped at Bagni Est Finale and stands still today. After an afternoon on the beach, wading in the azure waters of the Mediterranean, lunch in the patio tables, families move en masse for a nap under their umbrellas. The children often awaken before their parents, playing tag, football or random other games in the sand. Mr. Moresca, ever the maestro, has a large table in his cramped office with a floor plan that looks like seating for an orchestra, though the names penciled in next to each seat are family assignments for chaise longues. Much about traveling is about finding places like this: spots of unvarnished beauty where you can vacation amid locals who are embracing their own way of life, which is different from yours. This beauty inspires you, months later and back at work, to stare blankly in the distance, past your monitor and into your memories.

The Ligurian coast is certainly one of those spots. Its simplicity is like a time warp. It has none of the pretenses of Saint Tropez or big crowds of Cannes or even Cinque Terre or Amalfi Coast. But village after village offers an illustration of a kind of a slow-food world, delicious, worth savoring. Literally. A new generation of young chefs, inspired by the mix of cultures and flavors, are helping reshape the Italian palette along this coast, grabbing the local seafood, as well as meats, fruits and vegetables produced from the nearby mountains, to produce some of the best food coming out of Italy today yet largely ignored by foodies worldwide. My wife and I, and our two young children, spent a week in Liguria, deciding that we wanted to try something different beyond the well-trodden pathways of the French Cote d'Azur, to towns that for the most part, we had never heard of, or even heard anyone mention, other than perhaps San Remo. We stayed in a hotel just above Morasca's club called Hotel Punta Est, built atop a cliff that juts out into the Mediterranean, offering tremendous views of the Ligurian coast. The hotel, while luxurious in an Old World way, with compact, but comfortable rooms, a sprawling cliffside patio where breakfast and dinner are served, and a grand living-room-like common area, was actually one of the few places on our trip that we had a mediocre meal.

Nowadays, on Via Giuseppe Garibaldi, the main street, which is closed off to cars during the day, the shopkeepers are busy in their stores, while their children ride bikes in the street, laundry hangs from the clothes lines above, the ancient marble cistern still bubbles with water, and the bells from the San Michele church keep the time, marking moments in days that pass with nothing of much of consequence happening. We stayed just a few doors down from the church, in a tiny inn that had just three rooms, each of which opened into a large common living room, decorated with books and Italian Renaissance prints. (The owner's father was a professor of Italian literature at a local university.) Centuries ago, the inn was home was apparently owned by a family with ties to the prince of Genoa, hence the balcony for observing the assembled residents of the town, now used as an open-air patio where the fresh fruit and just baked pastries for breakfast are served.

Just down the hill is a collection of restaurants, and, of course, a small beach club (with small stones, not sand) facing the Mediterranean. It was in Ventimiglia, on the ""modern"" side of the small town that we had perhaps the best meal of our trip, at Il Giardino del Gusto. As is typical in these small towns, it was a run by a chef who also owned it, in this case Emanuele Donalisio, 32, who once worked alongside Michel Roux, the London-based French chef, while also doing stints in Monte Carlo and on cruise ship, where he tried out different flavors, from Latin America to Asia. That career history is apparent in his tremendous food, like the San Remo shrimp, caught nearby, which he prepared in a mango, fig and lime sauce, with olive oil and a special Sri Lanka pepper that had almost a grapefruit smell. Or in the locally caught sea bass, with trout eggs, carrot coulis, pine nuts, mushrooms and a dried, caramelized lemon. Ventimiglia also has a tremendous farmers market, with a display of fresh produce, locally made cheeses and pastas, meats and fish that offers a hint of just why the food is so tremendous here. Everything is so ripe and perfect. THE nearby town of Imperia has a restored port, lined with small fishing trawlers and luxury yachts, and also features a long row of restaurants and casual nighttime entertainment, including, the day we were there, a festival of jugglers, clowns and various children's games. Nearby was another collection of small, special restaurants, including Ristorante Sarri, right on a waterfront road and owned by Andrea Sarri, who recently served as head of a national alliance of young chefs. Some of the standout dishes at Sarri included the ravioli with pesto sauce, calamari with zucchini, baby lamb with artichokes. The fish, he picks from local boats, the artichokes, tomatoes and olive oil comes from his uncle's farm, and meat from an adjacent town. The way the Maritime Alps meet the sea here -- creating a combination of fresh game, produce, fruits and seafood -- explains the raw materials with which all these local chefs work, generating little international attention, but tremendous results.

We headed inland from Imperia, into the mountains, where we found a collection of sleepy villages, staying for three nights in Borgomaro, a postage-stamp sized medieval-era village, where we did not encounter a single English-speaking tourist. The town, population of about 900, is built on a hillside, with a mountain-fed stream running right through it, and again, narrow streets, bordered by ancient homes, many in disrepair, but others that have been turned into what is known as an ""albergo diffuso"" which is a hotel spread among various buildings, in renovated townhouses, now collectively called Relais Del Maro. There is next to nothing to do in this town -- other than enjoy quiet afternoons, with local kids scurrying around the nearly empty streets. You can fill your days breathing in the pristine mountain air, going for a hike in the nearby hills, or heading down to the beaches below, on the Mediterranean. And the need for no urgent agenda is what makes it just perfect. The nearby hillsides are overflowing with wildflowers. Many locals here grow Taggiasca olives and other local specialties to make their own olive oil, including Ugo Vairo, the owner of a small mountaintop restaurant called Il Gallo Della Checca, at the outskirts of Ranzo, another tiny town -- this one is so quiet it almost seems like it has been abandoned. The restaurant is frequented by bicyclists who ride the local quiet mountain roads pausing at the house where Mr. Vairo has lived for decades -- and where he also serves on the first floor a tremendous (but rich) risotto with his truffles, as well as a buffalo mozzarella, and a collection of other dishes. Just how fresh is all this? After we ate lunch, he walked us out to an adjacent field, to show us his olive trees, freshly grown tomatoes and his nero pregiato, the prized truffles, which are hidden in underground mounds. He shuts his restaurant down for a few days in November to harvest his olives, and then bottles his own olive oil, selling just 800 bottles each year. Again, life is defined by its slow pace and the permanence of its routines.

As we entered Bagni Est Finale, the beach club run by Franco Morasca and his sister, the clinking of the plates, and wafting smell of garlic pulled us into the patio restaurant -- serving up fresh but simple seafood and pasta. There is nothing luxurious about this place. It is more spartan than high end. But it does not aspire to be anything else. About the only commotion of the day was the small scrum at the espresso bar, as lunch time turned into afternoon. Mr. Morasca milled around, greeting the different families, handing out antique skeleton keys, which still open the lockers where summer guests store their bathing suits and other gear, for sojourns, after drying them in the sun each day on the community clothes line. ""It is so simple here,"" said Andrea Galli, who has been coming to take the same spot, with her family, for two decades. ""The beach, the sea, the sun, and the flow of life in Liguria. What else could you want?"""

The number of babies born in the United States in 2012 remained flat, the first time in five years that the number did not significantly decline, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The leveling off capped a 9 percent decline in the fertility rate from 2007 to 2011, a drop that demographers say began after the recession took hold and Americans started feeling less secure about their economic circumstances. The decline ""has come pretty close to grinding to a halt,"" said Carl Haub, a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit research group.

The fertility rate is the total number of babies born per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. Last year it stood at 63, down slightly from 2011. At the current rate, women could expect 1.9 babies on average over their lifetimes, down from a high of 3.8 in 1957, said Brady E. Hamilton, a demographer and an author of the report. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. The United States has a higher fertility rate than many other developed countries, bolstered by Hispanic immigrants, who are more likely than whites to be in their childbearing years. When rates are lower, as they are in countries like Germany and Japan, youth populations shrink, which can lead over time to a reduction in the size of the labor force and diminished tax bases. ""There's a widespread perception that a moderately growing population is advantageous for economic growth and for a growing society,"" said Hans-Peter Kohler, a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. That is why news of the 2012 figures had demographers buzzing. ""It's exciting,"" Professor Kohler said. ""My prediction would be that we'll see further stabilization and possibly growth in 2013."" The birthrate tends to rise and fall with economic cycles. The rate fell by a fifth during the Great Depression in the 1930s, according to Mr. Haub, creating a crater in the population that moved up the age ladder over time.

In 2011, the Pew Research Center analyzed the fall in fertility by geography and found a strong link between falling fertility and economic malaise: the only state to show a slight increase in fertility between 2008 and 2009 was North Dakota, which had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. The decline had been particularly pronounced for women who were among the hardest hit by the recession: young women and Hispanics. The data released on Friday showed that the fertility rate for both groups was still in decline, though the pace of the drop had slowed considerably. Young Hispanics have experienced the largest decline, with the rate down by a third since 2007 among women ages 20 to 24, said Kenneth Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire. But slightly older women, in their early 30s, saw an increase in their fertility rate in 2012, up from a flat rate in 2011 and a decline in 2010. Women in their early 40s were the only ones not to experience a decline in fertility during the economic downturn, as they did not have the time to delay childbearing.

""We are seeing the next youngest group dipping a toe in the water."" It is still unclear if the recent decline in births will be made up by a surge in fertility over the next few years, as happened during the baby boom after World War II. ""A big question is what will happen to the 1.3 million forgone births?"" Professor Johnson said. ""Will women start to have these babies, or will the births never be made up?""

Another bright spot was births to Asian and Pacific Island women, which were up by 7 percent in 2012 from the previous year. The increase may be related to the fact that 2012 was the Year of the Dragon in the Chinese zodiac, an auspicious year to be born for many Asian families, Mr. Hamilton said. The report showed continued declines in the birthrate to teenagers, which dropped by 6 percent last year from 2011, marking another historical low for that group. The preterm birthrate fell for the sixth straight year, and the share of babies born with low birth weight also declined. The share of all births to unmarried women in 2012 was unchanged from 2011 at 40.7 percent."
59808,European Central Bank's Leader Sees Progress in Tough Times for Euro Zone,"Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, along with a growing number of economists, argue that there are tentative signs that adjustments are beginning to pay off.","Mario Draghi, center, the president of the European Central Bank, spoke to a committee of Parliament in Brussels on Tuesday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/10/business/EUZONE/EUZONE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=370&w=600&s=f24e28361313616844e2f2c40338b8ba528b9682314467f58975bec03b629a7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/business/global/daily-euro-zone-watch.html,97fbbfb3-b857-5730-a89b-2a37a3272030.jpg,"FRANKFURT -- The president of the European Central Bank on Tuesday joined a small but growing number of economists who argue that, even though the euro zone still faces huge economic problems, there are tentative signs that two years of painful adjustment are beginning to pay off. Several countries, including Italy, Portugal and even Greece, have been able to increase exports. Labor costs have fallen in some of the troubled countries, which should further improve their ability to sell their goods on the global market. And in another positive signal, the flight of money from Spain was reversed in September for the first time since mid-2011. ""One should acknowledge the extraordinary challenges,"" Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, told a committee of the European Parliament in Brussels on Tuesday. But, he added, ""one should acknowledge the extraordinary progress both in data and economic reform."" For the moment, any glimmers of improvement are overshadowed by deep recession in southern Europe and staggering levels of unemployment. The risk of a euro zone breakup remains. It will be months if not years before citizens of countries like Greece and Spain perceive an improvement in their standards of living.

Mr. Draghi noted that economic changes had ""not yet had a fully visible impact on the everyday life of citizens in the countries suffering most from the crisis."" If the euro zone crisis ends someday, though, it will be because countries are able to escape the vicious circle created by recession, debt and austerity. Economic growth would lead to higher tax receipts. Governments would then have a better chance of repaying their debts and would face less pressure to cut spending. That day may still be a long way off. But some economists have begun challenging the economic orthodoxy, which held that the troubled euro zone countries were effectively doomed. Deprived of national currencies they could devalue, according to the conventional wisdom, the countries would never become competitive without inflicting so much pain on their citizens that there would be revolution in the streets. Workers have suffered plenty, of course, and protests in Madrid and other cities illustrate the depth of public frustration. In Athens on Tuesday, police officers fired tear gas and stun grenades at protesters during a visit by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, whom many Greeks blame for the austerity budgets that have caused a drastic decline in living standards. Recent data, though, shows that labor costs have already fallen substantially enough in Ireland, Spain and Portugal -- though not Italy -- to make it more feasible for them to compete on price with more efficient countries like Germany.

""We are seeing gradual signs of improving competitiveness,"" Mr. Draghi said. As wages have fallen, some troubled countries, including Portugal and Spain, have been able to sell more machinery, chemicals, wine and other products abroad, which is crucial if they are ever to return to growth. Even Greece, which is suffering a depression, managed to increase exports 15 percent in the first six months of 2012, according to European Union data. Greek exports remain low, totaling 12.5 billion euros, or about $16 billion, in the first half of the year. A single German company, Daimler, the maker of cars and trucks, exports far more. But the sharp increase in Greek exports, led by shipping and olive oil and other agricultural products, represents a rare bit of economic good news for the country. In another hopeful sign, there was an increase in money flowing into Spain during September, reversing an alarming capital flight, which at some points equaled an estimated 50 percent of gross domestic product, according to economists at Credit Suisse. They cautioned that data for one month, when inflows approached 20 billion euros, do not qualify as a trend. But, in a note to clients, the economists added: ""This was the most significant flow of capital back into the periphery since the euro crisis began."" Mr. Draghi and the central bank can probably take some credit for the willingness of investors and depositors to return to Spain. The bank's promise to buy government bonds from Spain and other countries if requested, and Mr. Draghi's promise to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, have eased fears that the currency union could break up. Even though the central bank has yet to deploy the new bond-buying program, the fact that it stands ready to act has at least temporarily restored faith in the euro. ""In a sense, nothing has changed fundamentally,"" said Giancarlo Corsetti, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Cambridge. ""On the other hand, everything has changed, because we can go ahead without being too vulnerable to shifting market sentiment."" Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, pointed out that German companies had been investing less in factories and equipment even though their export sales continued to rise. That can only mean that they are anxious about the future but might invest more if they were more confident.

""The main factor weighing on the growth outlook is not austerity,"" Mr. Kramer said. ""The main factor is this uncertainty. When firms doubt whether the euro is going to remain legal tender, then firms hesitate to invest -- even in Germany."" Mr. Kramer said he had ""penciled in"" a return to growth for the euro zone early next year. Plenty could still go wrong on the way to a revival. The green shoots of confidence could wilt in the smog of habitual quarreling and procrastination by European leaders. Ms. Merkel faces national elections next year, which could make her less willing to commit German resources to resolving the crisis. Mr. Draghi, as he had done previously, on Tuesday put the onus on Europe's political leaders. ""Our policy would be ineffective,"" he said, ""if the countries concerned do not undertake the necessary reforms."" In a reminder that serious disagreements remain among European leaders, German officials have shown reluctance to move ahead on a crucial element of the euro recovery program: establishing a single banking supervisor for the euro zone. Elke Konig, head of the Germany financial services regulator, known as BaFin, said on Tuesday that the January 2013 deadline to set up a common regulator within the central bank was unrealistic. ""I could imagine that we get there in January 2014 -- that's a guess,"" she told the German television broadcaster ARD, Reuters said. Jens Weidmann, the president of the German Bundesbank, has also expressed reservations about some elements of the bank plan."
31348,"Review: In 'Jesus Christ Superstar,' an Old Story for (Yet Another) New Millennium","Led by the R&B hitmaker John Legend, NBC's live, multicultural telecast of the early-1970s musical was a conceptual and artistic triumph.","John Legend as Jesus in ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" live in concert.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/arts/television/03jcs/03jcs-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=194cf856ef9f45c46cca15f461a4c328ca1d46edcb2a9c5b45905cd78fcd99c0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/arts/television/jesus-christ-superstar-live-in-concert-nbc-review.html,5a53cbec-eff3-564f-8ae0-2c6d5f8f3d56.jpg,"A conceptual and artistic triumph, NBC's live telecast of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" on Easter Sunday may have finally justified the recent live musical fad on network TV. Some technical flubs and one mixed-bag lead performance aside, the production was genuinely thrilling, taking chances with the staging of a classic but controversial Broadway show, much more daring than previous live musical broadcasts like ""The Sound of Music"" or ""Peter Pan."" With the R&B hitmaker John Legend playing Jesus Christ, Sara Bareilles as Mary Magdalene and Brandon Victor Dixon as Judas Iscariot, NBC's ""Superstar"" didn't lack for talent or star power, drawn as it was from the worlds of pop and theater. The real masterstroke, though, was the decision to perform live before a large audience at the Marcy Avenue Armory in Brooklyn. The energy of the crowd clearly goosed the cast, counteracting the over-prepared stodginess that hampers so many of these specials. And the crowd's passionate whooping underscored one of the musical's central themes: the dangers of uncritical celebrity worship. Written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" has long held something of a surprise place in the modern theatrical canon. Debuting in 1970 as a rock opera album, it made the leap to Broadway in 1971 and was nominated for five Tonys -- winning none. The 1973 movie adaptation by the director Norman Jewison was a box-office hit, but it is rarely touted as one of its era's great films.

[John Legend, Sara Bareilles and their co-stars on ""Superstar.""] Told largely from Judas's point-of-view, the story closely follows biblical accounts of Christ's arrest and crucifixion in Jerusalem, while adding substantial criticism of Jesus's followers; his communion with disreputable people; and his open, dangerous antagonism of both the Jewish and the Roman authorities. The musical then pushes back against its own skepticism, depicting the powers-that-be as corrupt, cynical and manipulative, exploiting the anxieties of Judas and the other apostles. In the years immediately after its premiere, the musical raised eyebrows and ire with its decidedly nontraditional spin on Christ's last days. By considering Jesus more as a cultural phenomenon than as a divine figure, and by exhibiting as much sympathy for Judas as for the man he betrayed, Mr. Webber and Mr. Rice delivered an interpretation of the Passion Play as radical in its way as director Martin Scorsese's much-protested film ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" did in 1988.

NBC's version showed reverence primarily toward the original musical, which for decades has told an ancient story in a way that pushes the audience to reconsider its relevance to the world today. Directed by David Leveaux and Alex Rudzinski, it respected the source material's sublime ambiguities, which many nonreligious fans have interpreted as subversive -- just as some pop-culture-savvy Christians have clung to it as a refreshingly tuneful, exultant expression of how faith can triumph over doubt. As Jesus, Mr. Legend delivered where it counted, putting his rich, soulful voice to work in seamless performances of well-loved songs like ""Everything's Alright"" (in duet with the equally accomplished Ms. Bareilles) and ""Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)."" Mr. Legend was less impressive as an actor. This was a song-only production, with zero dialogue, but it did require Mr. Legend to react -- which he tended to do with a broad facial expression best described as, ""John Legend is worried.""

The powerful and charismatic Mr. Dixon more than compensated for any of the headliner's shortcomings. Given what ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" ultimately says about idols and the people in their shadow, it is appropriate that this production was dominated by a Broadway veteran best known for replacing Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr in the Tony-winning smash ""Hamilton."" This show has always been less about the titular ""superstar"" than about the people surrounding him. This theme was evident in the telecast's staging. In the early going, audience noise sometime overloaded the sound mix, making it hard to hear the lyrics. But by urging the crowd to go bananas every time Mr. Legend sang or even moved, the creative team reinforced the idea that perhaps the masses gathered around Jesus weren't paying close attention to his actual message. The set design and costuming were effectively minimalist, with a vaguely post-apocalyptic ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" feel. Exposed scaffolding, freshly painted graffiti and a teeming horde of shabby-looking extras added to the overall vibe of controlled chaos. That mayhem occasionally gave way to moments of startling clarity, including: Alice Cooper's magnificently scenery-chewing performance of ""King Herod's Song""; Mr. Dixon's rousing take on the show's big anthem, ""Superstar""; and a miraculous bit of stagecraft during the crucifixion, in which Mr. Legend's Jesus seemed to disappear into another dimension. Give a lot of credit to the network, and to Mr. Legend, who was one of this broadcast's executive producers (along with Mr. Lloyd Webber, Mr. Rice, and the televised theater veterans Neil Meron, Marc Platt and Craig Zadan). A live musical about Jesus on Easter Sunday may seem like a safe choice, catering to an audience that has made Christian-themed movies like ""I Can Only Imagine"" into hits. But from the multicultural cast to its deconstruction of religious iconography, this ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" was as thoughtful and challenging as the show has ever been."

And yet that social media platform is still the best for looking at art and witnessing the creative process of an artist. (And I use the word ""artist"" loosely: I'm an avid consumer of memes.) I once described Instagram to a fellow critic as the ""show-me-the-money"" platform, and she agreed: substance (or lack thereof) is revealed pretty quickly, since you're generally looking at one image at a time with minimal captioning. I overhaul my feed frequently, unfollowing accounts that fail to amuse, inspire or inform. Here are five Instagram accounts I consistently view; New York Times critics will be posting their own picks every week.

OlaRonke Akinmowo's project is a mobile, pop-up library that showcases literature written by black women. It could be described as a social practice artwork, but also a participatory one: to borrow a book, you must give a book. I have learned about overlooked writers here, but also about Regina Anderson Andrews, who headed a library in Harlem and was friendly with Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes. Ms. Akinmowo, who lives in Brooklyn, has taken the library to the NY Art Book Fair. During the quarantine she's focused on authors like Octavia Butler, the science fiction writer who predicted some of the dystopias we're now experiencing. Ms. Akinmowo also posts some of her own collages, like one devoted to Harriet Tubman, which combine black and white found images with bright, almost psychedelic flourishes.

First of all, Mr. Phillips works best with words, arranged into minimal acerbic poems on his account @brad_phillips. (One reads ""America is my favourite movie."") The other account, @brad_phillips_group_show, is an agreeable reminder that artists often make the best curators. Here you can see the work of Cristine Brache (Mr. Phillips's wife), who also twists words into artworks, or Leon Spilliaert (1881-1946), an outre Belgian Symbolist painter who worked as an illustrator for Edgar Allan Poe's publisher and shared a similar creepy, horror-tinged approach. Like those of most artist-curators, Mr. Phillips's picks are highly idiosyncratic and reflect his own work's proclivities. But unlike many artists who think they can school you on art, Mr. Phillips actually delivers.

David Adjaye is the world-renowned architect who led the consortium that designed the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. More than practically any other account I follow, his Instagram visual sketchbook allows you to see inside the mind of a great designer. You get to travel the world like an international ""starchitect,"" and view the built environment from a technical angle. Mr. Adjaye, of Ghanaian descent, marvels over modernist buildings and palm-roofed structures in Ghana. He also analyzes high modernist architecture, and structures made by non-humans, like a termite tower in Africa constructed to avoid floods. Humans, Mr. Adjaye informs us, use these astonishing towers as a marker of where to construct their own dwellings. ""Talk about organic architecture,"" one commenter marveled.

Funny is good at this moment. David Shrigley, a British artist who creates posters, books, cartoons, tattoos and ""other stuff,"" as his website describes it, long ago mastered the art-as-comedy angle. His crudely drawn illustrations are wry, smart, sometimes angry, sometimes self-effacing -- but almost always absurd. They parallel a generation of dry, weird comedy from Britain, including Sacha Baron Cohen, Eddie Izzard or ""Little Britain"" (Matt Lucas and David Walliams). His creations work equally well on the gallery wall, hung salon-style at Anton Kern in New York, or on Instagram, where the images are stripped down, even more existential and sometimes naughtier. One recent drawing declares ""It Won't Be Like This Forever."" Styled as a tabloid newspaper cover, this message registers as reassuring, but with a hint of menace."

Learning China From the Ground Up 

By Michael Meyer 

296 pp. Bloomsbury. $28. NINE CONTINENTS 

A Memoir In and Out of China 

By  

Illustrated. 366 pp. Grove Press. $26. In China, everyone has a home. But most have never lived there. Laojia, translated literally, means ""old home"" and the phrase denotes the ancestral wellspring of a paternal lineage. In a restless, rapidly urbanizing nation with at least a quarter- billion people on the move, most Chinese are several towns removed from their ""old homes."" Yet in a land of such mass displacement, where unlovely Communist-era cities are being gutted and equally unlovely capitalist-era ones are materializing in their stead, people still confer an almost talismanic importance to their laojia. Michael Meyer, a Minnesotan who went to China as one of the Peace Corps' first volunteers there, and , a writer and filmmaker who grew up in a salt-spattered Chinese fishing village, explore the meaning of home in a nation perpetually in transition. The China they describe in their memoirs no longer exists, covered by layers of concrete, glass and fiber-optic cables that have tethered even the most isolated farmer to the modern age. Still, it is the journey through heady, whiplash times that helps us understand where the nation is going. If the 21st century is to be China's era, it's important to know how it will get there. As with so many Chinese born during the Cultural Revolution, Guo's roots are both tangled and tragic. Battered by a political purge, her parents offload their baby girl to a childless couple. But food is scarce. The foster family can't grow enough yams for an extra mouth. Instead, until she is almost 7, Guo must live with her destitute grandparents in a fishing hamlet where sustenance comes from strips of kelp and watery gruel.

Even when her parents take her back and she moves to the grimy city of Wenling, Guo is motivated most by a need to sate her hunger. At one point, she traps a bird and eats it with such urgency that she gulps down feathers and guts. Emotionally, she is also starved, particularly by her mother. In Guo's world, neither love nor any other sentiment is easily expressed. ""Silence was common in Chinese culture, it served a purpose,"" she writes. ""Never mention the tragedies, and never question them. Move on, get on with life. ..."" China has changed so much over the past few decades that it's easy to forget how much the vestiges of mass famine -- both physical and psychological -- still shape the national consciousness. When Guo wins a place at the Beijing Film Academy -- one of only 11 successful applicants out of 7,100 candidates -- she seems almost as excited by the plenitude of the canteen as she is by classes studying Godard and Kubrick. Meyer arrives in Sichuan Province in 1995, charged with teaching English to country pupils. A college administrator, who is a member of the Communist Party but also a lover of British Romantic poetry, dictates what Meyer's curriculum should cover: the Bible, the stock market and the Beatles. Filling one's belly is no longer an all-consuming endeavor but China remains a place with a great cuisine and lousy food. Meyer spends years suffering from food poisoning.

I studied in the eastern city of Nanjing the year before Meyer arrived in China and later covered the country as a reporter. His descriptions of the 1990s and early 2000s awakened my memories: the ambitious men with their pagers clipped to pleather belts; the young women click-clacking in heels and half-rolled pantyhose; the endless questions about life in America, especially how much everything cost. (Meyer's recollections also echo those of ""River Town,"" the 2001 memoir by his fellow Peace Corps volunteer Peter Hessler, who now writes for The New Yorker.)

Like Guo, Meyer ends up in Beijing, where he teaches at an international school, writes freelance stories and courts a feisty woman from Manchuria who will become his wife. His Beijing is a city so dedicated to self-improvement that it reflects little on what is lost on the way. ""Maybe,"" Meyer writes, ""Beijing kept tearing itself down to bury its unexamined past."" Meyer will go on to write a book about the destruction of Beijing's traditional alleyways, ""The Last Days of Old Beijing,"" as well as ""In Manchuria,"" which chronicles the transformation of his wife's hometown in the rural northeast. But his memoir, like Guo's, also captures a China where the syncopation of pile drivers only adds to the drumbeat of national optimism. I lived in Beijing back then. As in China as a whole, the sense of possibility in the capital was intoxicating, even if the ghosts of students massacred near Tiananmen Square lingered. Guo documents performance art in which exhibitionists eat human placentas to critique China's one-child policy. The police descend on grungy artist colonies but self-expression flourishes. Today's Beijing is sanitized and modernized. Bentleys and Serrano ham are on sale. But the city is no longer a playground for struggling artists or idealistic intellectuals. Late last year, entire warrens inhabited by migrants were razed. And under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, the Chinese dissident movement has been starved of oxygen. So many of my friends and acquaintances -- lawyers, writers, activists and artists who dared to articulate a different dream for China -- have either left the country or are in jail. Guo exited early when she won a scholarship in 2002 to study film in London. She is now a British citizen and has written novels in English, like ""A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers."" In 2013, Granta named her one of the best young British novelists. When her memoir veers to exile in Europe, its emotional punch is weaker, just as Meyer's story lags when he strays from Sichuan, Beijing and Manchuria. While he criticizes foreign correspondents for their facile coverage of China, his dispatches from Tibet and Xinjiang, vast lands on the edge of the Chinese Empire, also rely on quick anecdotes to fill out a larger truth. Still, Meyer is an amiable narrator, and he introduces the reader to some of China's greatest paradoxes, notably a pride in history that coexists with a compulsion to destroy the past. Guo uses her book to explore another contradiction: the role of women in a society where Chairman Mao deemed that women should hold up half the sky even as he kept a stable of concubines for his pleasure. Born long before the Communist revolution, Guo's grandmother was a child bride considered so insignificant that she lacked a name. The Communist census-takers who came to her remote fishing village were appalled by this relic of a feudal past, with her bound feet and bent body. By contrast, Guo's mother starred in revolutionary operas after her factory shift was over. Yet Chinese women are still owned and exploited. While confiding to dorm mates at the Beijing Film Academy, Guo realizes the pervasiveness of the sexual abuse she suffered as a teenager. Her best friend throws herself out of a window because of a man. Being a mistress is now a career choice for young women in China. Both Meyer and Guo begin their memoirs with quotes from ""Journey to the West,"" a classic 16th-century Chinese fable starring a Buddhist monk and a magical monkey. In search of Buddhist scriptures and enlightenment, man and monkey venture to India. For her part, Guo is raising her daughter in London. Meyer now teaches writing at the University of Pittsburgh. Perhaps their elegies for vanished homes in China required distance to write. After all, in these mutable times, a laojia exists not so much on a map but in the heart."

The Haitian band Lakou Mizik, which was formed after Haiti's catastrophic 2010 earthquake, has remade the New Orleans standard ""Iko Iko,"" a pop hit (for the Dixie Cups and others) based on half-understood Mardi Gras Indian chants that may have Haitian roots. Lakou Mizik added lyrics in Haitian Kreyol proclaiming the Haiti-New Orleans connection; the 79rs Gang, a Mardi Gras Indian alliance, sings the New Orleans chants. Hooting horns from Haiti's rara carnival tradition mix with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band; there's percussion from all sides and an earth-moving bass. Mardi Gras is March 5; the cultural cross-pollination, and the party, continue. PARELES

The music in ""The Barrel"" is folky and straightforward, circling through four chords fingerpicked on an acoustic guitar behind Aldous Harding's demure voice. The words are the conundrum: cryptic, imagistic and distinctly wary of some undefined commitment: ""Looks like a date is set/Show the ferret to the egg/I'm not getting led along."" And the video clip, with some surprises near the end, gives nothing away. PARELES

On her new album, ""Intuition: Songs from the Minds of Women,"" the vocalist Alicia Olatuja chose a wide range of songs written by female artists -- from Joni Mitchell to Angela Bofill to Imogen Heap -- and set about making a new imprint on each. Her album-closing rendition of ""This Woman's Work,"" by Kate Bush, features nothing but Olatuja's luminous, classically trained voice overdubbed a handful of times, wound together in an airy, a cappella arrangement. Bush's version was an intimate mash-up of '80s pop and folk song and musical theater; Olatuja has found a way to honor what made it so distinctive, while creating a whole new sound. RUSSONELLO

Michael Rother, the guitarist from the 1970s Krautrock trailblazers Neu! (and briefly before that, Kraftwerk), has collected a boxed set of his solo work, including previously unreleased tracks like this one from the score for the 2015 film ""The Robbers."" It unfolds methodically, with an octave-bouncing line somewhere between bass riff and mantric melody; three-and-a-half minutes in, some clanking, chattering electronics arrive to give it precisely the lift it needs. PARELES

The hypnosis continues. Gunna remains the most clever and intuitive rapper of the post-Young Thug generation, and on ""Baby Birkin"" -- a standout from his new ""Drip or Drown 2"" -- he circles again and again to a rhyme scheme that bleeds across the conventional bar structure, making the final syllable of each phrase into a de facto leadoff rhyme. The result is you never quite know if you're coming or going, if the end is in front of you or just behind. It's intoxicating. CARAMANICA

Norah Jones has been collaborating widely lately, flexing genre boundaries; this track will be on an album collecting those experiments. ""Just a Little Bit"" leans toward jazz and Minimalism, with the meticulous Brian Blade on drums carrying a syncopated pulse as Jones sustains a drone on organ and ornaments it sporadically on piano. Her voice is approachable as always, but what she is singing is more confrontational. ""I'm not the one you can refuse/I'm not your plaything, I'm not your muse."" Rightfully: This is not a time to take women for granted. PARELES

One of the great disappointments of the tail end of the SoundCloud rap boom is how thoroughly its anarchic instincts have been all but wrung out of it. Sometimes, when you hear Lil Pump rap, he sounds like ... a regular rapper. Which is fine, of course, if less fun. ""Harverd Dropout"" is his first full-length album, and while it features successful collaborations with Kanye West, Lil Uzi Vert, YG, 2 Chainz, Quavo and others, it's most impressive when an awareness of the rest of the world is filtered out. Take ""Vroom Vroom Vroom,"" an agglomeration of interjections, sound effects, bass throbs and more, slapped atop each other chaotically. It's exuberant fun, a return to the moment when what Lil Pump and others proposed was a new idea, a radical notion, an essential urge. CARAMANICA

The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, the drummer Eric Harland and the keyboardist James Francies lock into a big-boned, contemporary-jazz groove about a minute into ""Hold It,"" and you start to hear voices crowding the room. It's almost all Potter, overdubbed on top of himself, before the dubs drop out and he launches into one of his characteristically herculean solos. This track is from ""Circuits,"" a new album announcing a fresh band, but one that harkens to the electrified, funk-fusion group Underground, which Potter led about a decade ago. Nowadays, jaw-dropping technical displays are the norm for Potter, but this band can still get something new out of him. RUSSONELLO"

7987,Aunt Jemima Brand to Change Name and Image Over 'Racial Stereotype',"Quaker Oats, the owner of the 131-year-old brand, said it would retire the name as it worked ""to make progress toward racial equality.""",The Aunt Jemima character has roots in a 19th-century minstrel song that expressed nostalgia for the antebellum South.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/business/17unrest-jemima-01/17unrest-jemima-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b4b8f82a7adc3d999d69b8b1ef44cec840ae1ada51da548e2577210e54d26558&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/business/media/aunt-jemima-racial-stereotype.html,bb3e5972-ec36-5c07-9c30-1e5b0f2a1b03.jpg,"For decades, Quaker Oats knew that one of its major brands, Aunt Jemima, was built on racist imagery. The company inched toward fixing the problem over the years, replacing the kerchief on the Aunt Jemima character's head with a plaid headband in 1968, and adding pearl earrings and a lace collar in 1989. But it was not until Wednesday that Quaker Oats announced it would drop the Aunt Jemima name and change the packaging. The decision to remake the pancake-mix and syrup brand, which was founded in 1889, came as widespread protests against racism have reverberated throughout the country, leading to changes in the corporate world and the toppling of statues depicting Confederate leaders. Quaker Oats, which has been owned by PepsiCo since 2001, announced its decision on Aunt Jemima days after a TikTok video describing the brand's history was shared widely on social media. In retiring the name and character, the company acknowledged that Aunt Jemima's origins were ""based on a racial stereotype.""

The founders of the brand hired a former slave to portray Aunt Jemima at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago. In the 1930s, after Quaker Oats bought the brand, the character was played in a radio series by a white actress who had performed in blackface on Broadway. A 1954 magazine ad showed Aunt Jemima superimposed over an image of a plantation and a riverboat. Quaker Oats considered doing away with the logo in recent years, said Dominique Wilburn, who worked as an executive assistant at PepsiCo for several years. Ms. Wilburn said she joined an effort to come up with a rebranding campaign for Aunt Jemima in 2016. In her group of six people, she was the only person of color, she said. The group tossed around ideas, all the while ""very aware of the broader implications, and what would happen if we got this wrong,"" Ms. Wilburn said. The plan was to introduce changes during a tranquil period, when PepsiCo was not embroiled in any controversy. Suggestions ranged from changing the character's name to ""Aunt J"" to making Aunt Jemima's straightened hair more natural and building out her back story, Ms. Wilburn said. One proposal involved asking artists to remake the character's image; another called for sending Quaker Oats employees to a Southern plantation to help them understand the legacy of slavery, she said.

A team member suggested that Indra Nooyi, who was then PepsiCo's chief executive, release a contrite letter on the brand's troubled history; Ms. Wilburn said she criticized the idea that one of the few women of color leading a major corporation should have to apologize for her predecessors' mistakes. At the end of the process, Ms. Wilburn's group agreed that the Aunt Jemima name should be changed and the image removed, Ms. Wilburn said. But gaining approval from top executives was difficult, partly because PepsiCo found itself in a controversy after running a commercial that showed Kendall Jenner, a white model, delivering a can of Pepsi to a law enforcement officer at a Black Lives Matter protest, she said. PepsiCo said in a statement Wednesday that there were ""several workstreams"" reviewing the brand in 2016 and that ""due to personnel changes and shifting priorities, the workstream was eventually put on hold."" Since then, Quaker Oats has not given Aunt Jemima significant promotion. Last year, Quaker Oats spent $245,000 marketing the brand, compared with $6.2 million it spent on Life Cereal, excluding social media, according to the research firm Kantar. Ms. Wilburn said the company tried to avoid heavily promoting Aunt Jemima. ""They were constantly being told, 'Let's not over-promote it or do a lot of partnerships' -- nobody wanted to call attention to it,"" she said. ""Aunt Jemima was a category leader, and nobody wanted to mess with that stream of revenue."" Wednesday's announcement stemmed from several weeks of meetings between top PepsiCo leaders, employees and community leaders, the company said. The decision to change the brand, reported earlier by NBC News, came during the widespread protests against racism and police brutality prompted by the killing last month in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pinned him to the ground.

The protests have led to statements of support from companies like Nike and Twitter, which have declared Juneteenth on Friday an employee holiday. The sportswear giant Adidas pledged that 30 percent of new hires would be black or Latino and said it would fund 50 university scholarships a year for black students over the next five years. The makeup brand Sephora has pledged that 15 percent of the shelf space in its stores will feature products made by black-owned businesses. In other cases, the reckoning has prompted the ousting of executives, including the C.E.O. of CrossFit, who was dismissive of the uproar over Mr. Floyd's death. High-level editors at The New York Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer resigned after staff members criticized content related to the protests in those papers. The NBC late-night host Jimmy Fallon has apologized for performing in blackface on ""Saturday Night Live"" in 2000. Last week, the streaming service HBO Max temporarily removed the 1939 film ""Gone With the Wind"" from its catalog because of its glorification of the antebellum South, a depiction that included a subservient black character named Mammy. The Aunt Jemima brand has its roots in a 19th-century minstrel song, ""Old Aunt Jemima."" The character is one of ""many racialized caricatures"" that were ""the creation of the white imagination"" during the rise of the marketing industry, said Gregory D. Smithers, an American history professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. ""Marketing companies used racism to sell everything from soap, children's board games and food,"" said Mr. Smithers, who wrote a book about the use of racist imagery in popular media. Riche Richardson, an associate professor of African-American literature at Cornell University, called for an end to the Aunt Jemima character in a 2015 opinion essay in The Times. In an interview, she said, ""It is a symbol that is rooted in the 'Mammy' stereotype, that is premised on notions of black otherness and inferiority, that harkens back to a time when black people were thought of and idealized mainly in relation to servant positions."" On Monday, the singer Kirby described the history of the brand in a TikTok video that has been viewed more than 1.8 million times. The video, ""How to Make a Non Racist Breakfast,"" ends with her pouring a box of the pancake mix into a sink. The Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian amplified Kirby's message on Twitter, where he has more than 334,000 followers. ""How is Aunt Jemima not canceled??"" he wrote on Tuesday, linking to the TikTok video.

Kristin Kroepfl, the Quaker Oats chief marketing officer, said in a statement on Wednesday, ""While work has been done over the years to update the brand in a manner intended to be appropriate and respectful, we realize those changes are not enough."" Nancy Green, who played Aunt Jemima at the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, was born into slavery in Kentucky in 1834. In magazine ads throughout much of the 20th century, some by the artist N.C. Wyeth, the character was shown serving white families. From 1955 to 1970, Disneyland had an Aunt Jemima restaurant. It featured an actress costumed in a plaid dress, apron and kerchief who served food, sang and posed for photos with patrons, according to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia in Michigan. Black artists, including Joe Overstreet and Betye Saar, have challenged the character for decades. Mr. Overstreet painted Aunt Jemima wielding a machine gun in 1964 and created an expanded version of the work, called ""New Jemima,"" in 1970. Ms. Saar's 1972 mixed-media sculpture, ""The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,"" presented a ""mammy"" figurine armed with a rifle and a hand grenade against a backdrop of repeated images of Aunt Jemima's face. In 1980, in a commentary for National Public Radio, the black writer and culinary historian Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor called on Quaker Oats to retire the character. Other food brands, including Cream of Wheat, Land O'Lakes and Uncle Ben's, marketed themselves in the last century with racist stereotypes. After the Quaker Oats announcement on Wednesday, the food and candy giant Mars, the owner of Uncle Ben's, said it was ""evaluating all possibilities"" concerning the brand. Mars said it did not yet know the changes it would make or when they would go into effect, but added that it had a responsibility ""to take a stand in helping to put an end to racial bias and injustices."" Also on Wednesday, the syrup brand Mrs. Butterworth's said it was starting ""a complete brand and packaging review"" after acknowledging that its bottle, which is ""intended to evoke the images of a loving grandmother,"" could ""be interpreted in a way that is wholly inconsistent with our values."" The brand, owned by ConAgra Foods, said that ""it's heartbreaking and unacceptable that racism and racial injustices exist around the world"" and pledged to ""be part of the solution."""

While its Audi luxury division has done well, the VW brand itself has been losing sales traction. Despite loudly proclaimed high ambitions -- in 2009 VW announced its intention to triple its United States sales -- and large investments in American production facilities, sales fell 13 percent in the first six months of this year, according to Automotive News, compared with the first half of 2013. And that decline came as most mainstream brands were growing. Nissan was up 13 percent. Chevrolet, despite all those recalls, gained 1 percent. And Subaru, once a marginal also-ran, jumped 16 percent, selling 238,008 vehicles to VW's 179,144. Some of VW's lackluster sales can be attributed to poor reliability ratings in surveys by Consumer Reports and others. Some is due to the company's inability to develop products with lasting appeal in this market. Either way, the wind is out of VW's sails, and its sales.

So here is the Jetta GLI, the most sporting, most expensive version of VW's best-selling car in America. My test car was practically blinding in Tornado Red paint, riding on a set of luscious 18-inch alloy wheels -- a bold machine in a compact sector where most sedans are dressed in gentle gray, somnambulant silver or passive pewter. The GLI is a car built to add excitement to the line. The wheels are part of an Edition 30 package that celebrates the 30th anniversary of the GLI. (The Jetta itself has been around since 1979.) It looks suitably Germanic, and VW likes to boast that it was engineered in Germany, but the Jettas sold in the United States are assembled at VW's huge plant in Puebla, Mexico. The Edition 30 treatment includes a red line across the grille, a trunk lid spoiler, some contrasting upholstery stitching, a few bits of carbon-fiber trim and the critically important Edition 30 badging. So if you love red lines on your grille, buy an Edition 30 right now; it's unlikely that there will be an Edition 31 next year. The formula for the GLI has always been straightforward. Since the Jetta has essentially been a Golf with a trunk, and the Golf GTI is a Golf with more power and better handling, it is easy to apply the distinctive GTI parts to the Jetta. The current Jetta, which was thoroughly redesigned for the 2011 model year, isn't as closely related to the Golf as previous models had been, but the two cars are still close. The test car was a Jetta GLI Edition 30 With Navigation (yes, that's the proper name) with a $30,595 sticker price including an oppressive $820 delivery charge and no options. The GLI shares its turbocharged, direct-injected 4-cylinder engine, which makes 210 horsepower, with the GTI. The same 2-liter engine can be found in the Audi A3 quattro and the A4, producing 220 horsepower in a slightly different state of tune. And for no apparent reason, opting for the navigation system also brings along ""Bi-Xenon"" headlights with LED daytime running lights and halogen fog lights that come on to throw additional lumens into turns.

I refuse to pass along rumors that Bi-Xenons will soon invade the Earth and enslave us all. In contrast, the basic Jetta S, powered by a naturally aspirated 115-horsepower 2-liter engine, starts at $17,715. One step up is the $19,715 SE powered by a turbocharged 170-horsepower 1.8-liter 4-cylinder. So the GLI Edition 30 flies high over lesser Jettas. But there's still a lot of $18,000 Jetta S in this $30,000 GLI. The interior decoration isn't just austere, it's severe. The dashboard shapes are simple, the controls are straightforward and what decoration exists is easy to overlook. There's nothing about the controls that's illogical or frustrating, but there's nothing memorable either. Then there are the door panels, which are hard and unyielding. Softer textures there would make the whole cockpit feel richer and more comfortable. Beyond that, the navigation screen is a puny five inches and the menus one has to scroll through to get anything done are obscure. I never did get my iPhone 5S to synch with the GLI's Bluetooth system. The ""leatherette"" front seats aren't as supportive as they should be, and for no apparent reason are not the same ones used in the GTI. But things impove when the start button low on the center console is pressed, the engine whirs to life and settles into a deceptively anonymous idle. Deceptive simply because this engine is flat wonderful. Flat, like its torque curve. While the 210-horsepower rating seems modest -- the Ford Focus ST's 2-liter turbo engine is rated at 252 horsepower -- the 207-pound feet of peak torque is available way down at 1,700 r.p.m. and then keeps on pulling. There are moments when snicking through the light-shifting 6-speed manual transmission seems almost superfluous. The low-end torque production is so easygoing that it doesn't matter that the engine's redline -- the upper limits of safe operation -- is only 6,100 rpm. If the stick shift is too much work, a dual-clutch 6-speed automated transmission is also available for another $1,100. Car and Driver magazine tested a manual transmission 2013 Jetta GLI -- when the engine was rated at 200 horsepower -- and achieved a 0 to 60 time of 6.4 seconds. The current car doesn't feel any quicker than that.

No surprise that the engine in the new GLI behaves identically to that in the last 2013 GTI that I drove (I haven't sampled the new 2015 GTI.) The chassis, on the other hand, doesn't. While all 2011 Jettas used an inexpensive twist-beam axle in back, in 2013 VW wisely upgraded the GLI to the all-independent multilink system used in the GTI. All 2014 Jettas now use the multilink system. But despite the improved tail end, the Jetta GLI lacks the Golf GTI's fingertip sensitivity and eagerness to dive into corners. Some of that is due to the 104.4-inch wheelbase, which is almost three inches longer than the last-generation GTI, and more of it is likely due to the 16.3 inches of additional overall length. The two cars use electrically assisted rack-and-pinion steering with the same ratio, and ride on the similar 225/40R18 all-season performance tires, but the Jetta feels heavier. There's still fun to be had with the GLI, but it's not as engaging as its little brother. More irritating is a lack of sophistication in the ride quality. There's plenty of room in the Jetta's rear seat, but passengers back there take a beating on bumpy pavement. The harsh ride isn't as noticeable from the front seats, but my wife and children complained loudly about their discomfort. In the back at least, where that big 15.5 cubic-foot trunk lives, VW has more stiffly sprung the Jetta GLI than the hatchback GTI. Many of the revisions made to create the Jetta GLI Edition 30 forecast revisions that VW will make to the whole Jetta line for 2015. But they're revisions and not a redesign. What the Jetta GLI lacks is eagerness, a passion that would outshine its conservative design. After all, Tornado Red paint only takes you so far. The GLI is neither a GTI with a trunk, nor a budget alternative to the high-style Audi A3. It needs to be at least as compelling as one of those if VW is going to tack into the wind and fill its sails."
58331,Lower Health Insurance Premiums to Come at Cost of Fewer Choices,"With insurance marketplaces set to open next month under the new health care law, consumers may find that insurers have put big limits on their choices.","Peter L. Gosline, the chief executive of Monadnock Community Hospital in Peterborough, N.H.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/23/us/jp-HEALTH/jp-HEALTH-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=431&w=600&s=972cad1743442e7280238b8a5d748018b259388e61d93f6ab04e4eed712804b9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/health/lower-health-insurance-premiums-to-come-at-cost-of-fewer-choices.html,79a57526-5895-5c70-8411-f134d7ee2014.jpg,"WASHINGTON -- Federal officials often say that health insurance will cost consumers less than expected under President Obama's health care law. But they rarely mention one big reason: many insurers are significantly limiting the choices of doctors and hospitals available to consumers. From California to Illinois to New Hampshire, and in many states in between, insurers are driving down premiums by restricting the number of providers who will treat patients in their new health plans. When insurance marketplaces open on Oct. 1, most of those shopping for coverage will be low- and moderate-income people for whom price is paramount. To hold down costs, insurers say, they have created smaller networks of doctors and hospitals than are typically found in commercial insurance. And those health care providers will, in many cases, be paid less than what they have been receiving from commercial insurers. Some consumer advocates and health care providers are increasingly concerned. Decades of experience with Medicaid, the program for low-income people, show that having an insurance card does not guarantee access to specialists or other providers.

Consumers should be prepared for ""much tighter, narrower networks"" of doctors and hospitals, said Adam M. Linker, a health policy analyst at the North Carolina Justice Center, a statewide advocacy group. ""That can be positive for consumers if it holds down premiums and drives people to higher-quality providers,"" Mr. Linker said. ""But there is also a risk because, under some health plans, consumers can end up with astronomical costs if they go to providers outside the network."" Insurers say that with a smaller array of doctors and hospitals, they can offer lower-cost policies and have more control over the quality of health care providers. They also say that having insurance with a limited network of providers is better than having no coverage at all. Cigna illustrates the strategy of many insurers. It intends to participate next year in the insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Tennessee and Texas. ""The networks will be narrower than the networks typically offered to large groups of employees in the commercial market,"" said Joseph Mondy, a spokesman for Cigna.

The current concerns echo some of the criticism that sank the Clinton administration's plan for universal coverage in 1993-94. Republicans said the Clinton proposals threatened to limit patients' options, their access to care and their choice of doctors. At the same time, House Republicans are continuing to attack the new health law and are threatening to hold up a spending bill unless money is taken away from the health care program. In a new study, the Health Research Institute of PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting company, says that ""insurers passed over major medical centers"" when selecting providers in California, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, among other states. ""Doing so enables health plans to offer lower premiums,"" the study said. ""But the use of narrow networks may also lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses, especially if a patient has a complex medical problem that's being treated at a hospital that has been excluded from their health plan."" In California, the statewide Blue Shield plan has developed a network specifically for consumers shopping in the insurance exchange. Juan Carlos Davila, an executive vice president of Blue Shield of California, said the network for its exchange plans had 30,000 doctors, or 53 percent of the 57,000 doctors in its broadest commercial network, and 235 hospitals, or 78 percent of the 302 hospitals in its broadest network.

""We expect to have the broadest and deepest network of any plan in California,"" Mr. Davila said. ""But not many folks who are uninsured or near the poverty line live in wealthy communities like Beverly Hills."" Daniel R. Hawkins Jr., a senior vice president of the National Association of Community Health Centers, which represents 9,000 clinics around the country, said: ""We serve the very population that will gain coverage -- low-income, working class uninsured people. But insurers have shown little interest in including us in their provider networks."" Dr. Bruce Siegel, the president of America's Essential Hospitals, formerly known as the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, said insurers were telling his members: ""We don't want you in our network. We are worried about having your patients, who are sick and have complicated conditions."" In some cases, Dr. Siegel said, ""health plans will cover only selected services at our hospitals, like trauma care, or they offer rock-bottom payment rates."" In New Hampshire, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a unit of WellPoint, one of the nation's largest insurers, has touched off a furor by excluding 10 of the state's 26 hospitals from the health plans that it will sell through the insurance exchange. Christopher R. Dugan, a spokesman for Anthem, said that premiums for this ""select provider network"" were about 25 percent lower than they would have been for a product using a broad network of doctors and hospitals.

Anthem is the only commercial carrier offering health plans in the New Hampshire exchange. , said his hospital had been excluded from the network without any discussions or negotiations. ""Many consumers will have to drive 30 minutes to an hour to reach other doctors and hospitals,"" Mr. Gosline said. ""It's very inconvenient for patients, and at times it's a hardship."" State Senator Andy Sanborn, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said, ""The people of New Hampshire are really upset about this."" Many physician groups in New Hampshire are owned by hospitals, so when an insurer excludes a hospital from its network, it often excludes the doctors as well. David Sandor, a vice president of the Health Care Service Corporation, which offers Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, said: ""In the health insurance exchange, most individuals will be making choices based on costs. Our exchange products will have smaller provider networks that cost less than bigger plans with a larger selection of doctors and hospitals."" Premiums will vary across the country, but federal officials said that consumers in many states would be able to buy insurance on the exchange for less than $300 a month -- and less than $100 a month per person after taking account of federal subsidies. ""Competition and consumer choice are actually making insurance affordable,"" Mr. Obama said recently.

Many insurers are cutting costs by slicing doctors' fees. Dr. Barbara L. McAneny, a cancer specialist in Albuquerque, said that insurers in the New Mexico exchange were generally paying doctors at Medicare levels, which she said were ""often below our cost of doing business, and definitely below commercial rates."" Outsiders might expect insurance companies to expand their networks to treat additional patients next year. But many insurers see advantages in narrow networks, saying they can steer patients to less expensive doctors and hospitals that provide high-quality care. Even though insurers will be forbidden to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, they could subtly discourage the enrollment of sicker patients by limiting the size of their provider networks. ""If a health plan has a narrow network that excludes many doctors, that may shoo away patients with expensive pre-existing conditions who have established relationships with doctors,"" said Mark E. Rust, the chairman of the national health care practice at Barnes & Thornburg, a law firm. ""Some insurers do not want those patients who, for medical reasons, require a broad network of providers."""
51407,How T. Boone Pickens Sits Tight in the Riskiest of Businesses,"The leader of BP Capital enjoys risk, but he backs it up by staying supremely well informed about the market, which nourishes a confidence in his convictions.","T. Boone Pickens Jr., in a conference room at his office in Dallas, is known to stick with his investments even when the prices are not going in his direction.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/13/your-money/13WEALTH-NOCERA1/13WEALTH-NOCERA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=08287bc5193345d444386172f9c87b02abdd6d801c91766e5d289ffb80bbce31&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/your-money/t-boone-pickens-risky-business.html,37f28cea-c8f1-5ff6-a744-8dfe41afcbd7.jpg,"On one level, this was the silliest of questions. Mr. Pickens, after all, is a man who abruptly quit his corporate job at 25, with $1,500 in the bank, to start his own company, which he called Mesa Petroleum. He spent the next four decades poking holes in the ground, searching for oil and natural gas -- without question one of the activities with the highest risk in all of business. In the 1980s, he famously made a series of audacious takeover attempts aimed at companies -- Gulf Oil, Phillips, Unocal -- that were 10, 20, 30 times the size of Mesa. For years he covered his company's general overhead budget by playing the commodities market. In the 1990s, he bet big, and bet wrong, on the price of natural gas. That, and a lengthy bout with depression, which was undiagnosed for years, caused him to lose his company in 1996 at the age of 67. Rather than retire, Mr. Pickens decided to start a hedge fund to trade commodities, primarily natural gas futures. In the of 1997, he raised $37 million -- $8 million of which was his money. By early 1999, however, the fund had lost more than 90 percent, and was under $3 million.

But by the end of 2000, with his depression lifted and his faith in his own judgment restored, the fund was up to $252 million, a gain of more than 9,000 percent. By 2008, he was worth $3 billion, according to Forbes. So yes, it's pretty obvious that T. Boone Pickens enjoys risk. But as it turns out, that's not the whole answer. I've known Mr. Pickens for more than three decades, ever since I was working for Texas Monthly and wrote about his first takeover attempt in 1982. Over the years, we've stayed in touch, and I've written about him or quoted him any number of times, including in several of my old ""Talking Business"" columns for The New York Times.

But even though I've always known about his adventures as a commodities trader, I realized recently that I had never talked to him about risk -- about how he thinks about it, and why his tolerance for it is so high. And whether ordinary investors can learn something from the way he invests, just as they do when they pay attention to Warren Buffett.

Thus it was that on a recent morning in Dallas, I found myself in a large conference room in the offices of Mr. Pickens's investment firm, BP Capital. One wall was dominated by a large screen -- as big as anything you'd see on Wall Street, blinking instantaneous prices for crude oil, natural gas, some energy-related stocks (BP Capital also now manages an energy stock fund) and a handful of other things Mr. Pickens likes to keep track of. CNBC and Fox News were on but muted. Mr. Pickens's wealth has dropped to $500 million, in no small part because he had chosen to give much of it away. At 88, his most serious physical problem is his hearing. As he sat down, he pulled out a small amplification device and placed it on the table. Even so, he often had to ask the others in the room -- there were five of us -- to repeat things. Which is not the same as saying he didn't ultimately understand what was being said. He has always had a voracious appetite for information, and he is the unquestioned decision-maker at BP Capital. His team's role, in no small part, is to help supply the information he needs to make decisions. All year long, Mr. Pickens's funds -- there are now a half-dozen, managing around $1 billion -- had been ""long"" on oil, meaning that they had been betting that the price, which is currently in the mid-$40 range, was going to rise. Less than two years ago, the price of oil was as high as $120 a barrel. As the price dropped, big, expensive exploration projects had been canceled, and the number of wells being drilled had dropped sharply. Pickens's thesis was that this drop in supply was bound to make demand tight -- which, in turn, would cause the price of oil to rise. He had put on his long position eight months early, and was completely unruffled by the market's daily ups and downs. Which is one thing that you quickly learn about him as an investor. As he puts it, ""We're not traders.""

If he has looked at all the available information, studied the fundamentals and believes his thesis is still right, he'll stick with it even if the price isn't going in his direction. If he believes strongly enough, he'll use the drop in price as a buying opportunity. That is one of those attributes that separates great investors -- Mr. Buffett does the same thing -- from the rest of us.

And then there is the information itself. I saw Mr. Pickens speak a few months ago in Texas and was thunderstruck at how much information about the current state of the oil and gas industry he had at his fingertips. In the conference room at BP Capital, I got a strong sense of how that information is accumulated and used. They talked about when the weather was supposed to turn cold, which generally pushes natural gas prices higher, and why Exxon Mobil's stock had been rising lately. They dissected a few of the big exploration projects that had been canceled. One member of the Pickens team put up some charts showing vehicle miles driven against the price of gasoline. ""Does a 10 percent rise in price impact demand?"" he said. ""So far, the answer has been no."" ""We're seeing supply coming down,"" someone else said. ""That was predictable,"" replied Mr. Pickens, ""because there aren't any rigs."" And then there were the Saudis and the other oil-producing nations. An important part of Pickens's investing thesis is that OPEC, led by the Saudis, was going to have to lower production to get the price higher. Over and over again, they reviewed the logic: The oil-producing countries needed higher oil prices to fund their societies; they just couldn't keep letting oil drop. Saudi debt had gone from $40 billion to $280 billion, someone said. ""It's killing them,"" Mr. Pickens said. ""What we do is check, check, check,"" he told me when the meeting had ended. ""You are always checking to see if you have screwed up on your conclusions. The market doesn't believe the Saudis will cut oil production to get the price up, and I can't believe they haven't done it so far. We'll see by the end of the year."" In the meantime, he had no intention of changing his position. ""Boone is an educated risk-taker,"" said Michael Ross, who until 2010 was Mr. Pickens's primary futures trader. ""He takes a position and if it goes against him, he'll start asking questions. And if he still thinks he's right, he'll double up. He bets on himself. When you have conviction, you can withstand risk.""

Gathering information, holding firm even if the market is going against you, these are things that the rest of us can do if we put our minds to it. But it's the size of the risk Mr. Pickens takes -- the willingness to bet it all if he thinks he's right -- that most investors will never be able to do. Risk has been a part of Mr. Pickens's business life for so long, it barely causes him to blink. Thus came his answer to my original question. ""Do you enjoy risk?"" He thought for a minute and then chuckled. ""I guess so,"" he said."

His songs blend reggaeton and what's become known as Latin trap, the Spanish-language equivalent of the Atlanta-bred hip-hop subgenre. The result is surprisingly understated, relying on Ozuna's sugary-sweet crooning over airy synths that together are grounded by classic dembow beats.

With music and lyrics by the pop songwriters Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, the production was the latest effort to retool a hit movie for the stage. The show was capitalized for up to $17 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but after a strong start, the box office fell off considerably; the musical grossed $538,552 for the week ending June 30 -- only 39 percent of its potentia l.

In a season that also included the adaptations of the movies ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Tootsie,"" ""Pretty Woman,"" which Jerry Mitchell directed, was harshly reviewed and didn't pick up any Tony Award nominations. At the time of its Aug. 18 closing it will have played 27 previews and 421 regular performances.

From the start, the musical faced an especially knotty challenge: how to modernize the movie's male-savior plot for a post-#MeToo audience. Could Vivian, the hooker with a heart of gold played by Ms. Roberts in the film, be the savior this time around? Despite the feminist gloss, the show still ""hewed suffocatingly close to the film's story, gags and dialogue,"" Ben Brantley wrote in his review for The New York Times."

4000,The Right Way to Fight Fake News,Social media platforms need to make sure their anti-misinformation strategies are empirically grounded.,"In 2017, Facebook began putting up posters to raise awareness about fake news.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/24/opinion/24RandPennycook/24RandPennycook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=5ef0a966b2cde3c5a492cfa90beaf3c7e318f1484cf827c3f08bef2bc51520d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/fake-news-social-media.html,abfb9bf0-d5c5-54f0-8fdd-eafa25319847.jpg,"Social media companies have been under tremendous pressure since the 2016 presidential election to do something -- anything -- about the proliferation of misinformation on their platforms. Companies like Facebook and YouTube have responded by applying anti-fake-news strategies that seem as if they would be effective. As a public-relations move, this is smart: The companies demonstrate that they are willing to take action, and the policies sound reasonable to the public. But just because a strategy sounds reasonable doesn't mean it works. Although the platforms are making some progress in their fight against misinformation, recent research by us and other scholars suggests that many of their tactics may be ineffective -- and can even make matters worse, leading to confusion, not clarity, about the truth. Social media companies need to empirically investigate whether the concerns raised in these experiments are relevant to how their users are processing information on their platforms. One strategy that platforms have used is to provide more information about the news' source. YouTube has ""information panels"" that tell users when content was produced by government-funded organizations, and Facebook has a ""context"" option that provides background information for the sources of articles in its News Feed. This sort of tactic makes intuitive sense because well-established mainstream news sources, though far from perfect, have higher editing and reporting standards than, say, obscure websites that produce fabricated content with no author attribution.

But recent research of ours raises questions about the effectiveness of this approach. We conducted a series of experiments with nearly 7,000 Americans and found that emphasizing sources had virtually no impact on whether people believed news headlines or considered sharing them. People in these experiments were shown a series of headlines that had circulated widely on social media -- some of which came from mainstream outlets such as NPR and some from disreputable fringe outlets like the now-defunct newsbreakshere.com. Some participants were provided no information about the publishers, others were shown the domain of the publisher's website, and still others were shown a large banner with the publisher's logo. Perhaps surprisingly, providing the additional information did not make people much less likely to believe misinformation. Subsequent experiments showed why. Most viral headlines from distrusted publishers were obviously false (for example, ""WikiLeaks confirms Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS"") -- even without knowing the source. Adding publisher information typically added little beyond what you could determine from the headline itself. Consider another anti-misinformation tactic used by social media platforms: enlisting professional fact checkers to identify false content. An early Facebook strategy for combating fake news, for example, was to flag false headlines with a ""disputed by third-party fact checkers"" warning, and a recently leaked memo suggests that Twitter is considering a similar approach. Unfortunately, this is also an example of an intuitive approach that research suggests may not work as expected. We and our colleagues conducted experiments that found that though people were less likely to believe and share headlines that had been labeled false -- common sense was right about that -- people also sometimes mistook the absence of a warning label to mean that the false headlines may have been verified by fact checkers. This is a problem because only a small percentage of false headlines ever get checked and marked: Fact-checking is a painstaking, time-consuming process, whereas troll farms and internet bots can create and distribute misinformation with alarming speed.

In other words, a system of sparsely supplied warnings could be less helpful than a system of no warnings, since the former can seem to imply that anything without a warning is true. Another seemingly promising strategy is to provide general warnings about the existence of fake news and to offer tips about spotting misinformation. In 2017, Facebook began a public-relations campaign along those lines that included billboards and subway signage informing people that ""Fake news is not your friend."" Here, too, research suggests that such tactics can be counterproductive, since they often reduce confidence in all news, regardless of veracity (which, as it happens, is the goal of many disinformation campaigns). Of course, sometimes ideas that make intuitive sense do work. Getting people to slow down and engage in more critical thinking, for example, has been shown to reduce belief in fake news and to reduce the sharing of it. Likewise, sometimes ideas that seem terrible turn out to be effective. In 2018, Facebook proposed surveying its users about how much they trusted various news sources and then using that information to selectively promote content from sources rated as trustworthy. That proposal was greeted with widespread condemnation and ridicule, but empirical tests that we conducted indicated that this crowdsourcing approach was highly effective at identifying sources of misinformation. The obvious conclusion to draw from all this evidence is that social media platforms should rigorously test their ideas for combating fake news and not just rely on common sense or intuition about what will work. We realize that a more scientific and evidence-based approach takes time. But if these companies show that they are seriously committed to that research -- being transparent about any evaluations that they conduct internally and collaborating more with outside independent researchers who will publish publicly accessible reports -- the public, for its part, should be prepared to be patient and not demand instant results. Proper oversight of these companies requires not just a timely response but also an effective one.

America's Environmental Pioneer and His Restless Drive to Save the West

By John Taliaferro 

Without a doubt, the United States is a better place because of George Bird Grinnell. Born into moderate wealth and raised in a still-rural oasis of Upper Manhattan, educated by implied entitlement at Yale, he could have moved into a predestined groove among the privileged and powerful of the Gilded Age. But Grinnell took up the cause of all that a hyper-expanding America was destroying: native people, untrammeled land, birds and bison and big bears. We have the vigorous avian lobby of the Audubon Society, some of the world's most iconic national parks and several encyclopedic studies of Native Americans largely because of Grinnell. And yet, he remains overlooked among the founders of American conservation. In John Taliaferro's book, we finally have an exhaustively detailed biography of an inexhaustible man who deserves his place in the pantheon of environmental founders. To the modern mind, Grinnell can seem an old-boy WASP throwback. But it's best to judge the man by the standards of his day, not ours. Born a dozen years before the start of the Civil War, he lived through nine decades and died just before the onset of World War II. He was among a handful of giants who experienced and helped to shape so much of the young nation's history, seeing airplanes fly over the empty plains where he'd once hunted bison with the Pawnee. His contemporaries and friends included Theodore Roosevelt, the forester Gifford Pinchot, the photographer Edward Curtis and leaders of the Blackfeet and Cheyenne. He just missed being among the casualties of the last ill-fated campaign of George Armstrong Custer at the Little Bighorn in 1876, after accompanying Custer on an expedition to the Black Hills two years earlier.

Grinnell is a lost breed -- the Ivy League-educated gentleman sportsman, equally at home in the clubby air of New York's finest interiors as he was scrambling over glaciers in Montana. To his credit, he was more interested in protecting indigenous American wonders than in bringing home trophies. The glories of the U.S. national park system draw hundreds of millions of visitors each year.

Grinnell grew up on the former estate of John James Audubon, in what is now the neighborhood of Washington Heights. Though the great American Birdman had died in 1851, two years after Grinnell's birth, his widow, Lucy Audubon, became a teacher of sorts to the boy who roamed the forested New York precinct. After he brought her a captive red crossbill, Grandma Audubon, as she was often known, set the bird free. He got his first pony at 10 and his first gun at 12. Following the blue-blooded imperatives of his businessman father, he graduated from Yale College in 1870, and added a Ph.D. from the same school 10 years later, with a doctorate in the study of bones. Grinnell's introduction to a West he would champion for more than half a century was a Yale fossil-finding expedition under the tutelage of the paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh, one of the first curators of the Peabody Museum. ""I believed that now I was on the frontier,"" Grinnell wrote in 1870, outside Omaha, the kind of exclamation you would expect from an insular member of Yale's Scroll and Key Club upon a first trip ""Out West."" They dug up a great many bones on the Plains, including those from native people's sacred burial grounds. The person who would become best known as a great friend of American Indians got his start as an Indian grave robber. On a bison hunt with the Pawnee in 1872, Grinnell was lucky enough to see a world that would soon be gone. It stayed with him for the rest of his life. The Indians hunting these beasts, stripped to near-nakedness, using bows and arrows to kill, thrilled him. ""Armed with these ancestral weapons, they had become once more the simple children of the plains,"" he wrote. ""Here was barbarism pure and simple. Here was nature.""

Custer showed him a different view of that ""nature,"" on an excursion into land in the northern Plains that had been promised to the Sioux by treaty. Grinnell served as naturalist for that expedition in 1874, an apparent breach of sovereignty that led to a gold rush, and eventual loss of land that the Sioux considered ""the heart of everything that is."" Of Custer, killed two years later at the Little Bighorn, Grinnell would write that he ""knew nothing about Indians and was anyhow a harum-scarum fellow."" Grinnell's own knowledge of three tribes of the Plains -- the Pawnee, the Blackfeet and the Cheyenne -- would expand with every summer he spent out West. As an author, he was considered the premier ethnologist of these people. But his tone would have made his subjects wince. While advocating for the people of Indian country, while learning their languages, customs and religious ways, and explaining it to the rest of the world, he still sounded like a cultural interloper from Manhattan. He wrote that Indians had ""the stature of a man with the experience and reasoning powers of a child."" This sentiment was common among even the most progressive voices of the time. But when considering the alternative -- the plunderers, robber barons and overt racists who tried to wipe the native imprint from the land -- Grinnell was ahead of his time. ""The story of our government's intercourse with this race is an unbroken narrative of injustice, fraud and robbery,"" he wrote in 1892. Taliaferro, an author of five previous books, does a good job defending his subject on this count, noting how Grinnell's attitude evolved from the romantic to the pragmatic. ""The tendency is to lump men of his generation and class in one foul ball of bigotry,"" he writes. With his other great lifework, on behalf of the natural world, Grinnell accomplished much. As the longtime editor of Forest and Stream, he went after poachers, pushed politicians to protect the habitat of the creatures his readers loved to hunt, and tried to shame his fellow citizens for what they were doing in the name of civilization. He was largely responsible for the creation of Glacier National Park. And a glacier in those American Alps still bears his name, though it's shrinking rapidly under the duress of climate change. (Grinnell College, in Iowa, is not connected with him or his immediate family.) In giving Grinnell his due, Taliaferro, a former senior editor at Newsweek, could have put his manuscript on a diet. There is far too much detail about peripheral matters that do little to enhance the character or his passions. The story often lacks momentum. He is coy -- annoyingly so -- about whether Grinnell, who married late in life, might have been gay. There's much hinting of ""Brokeback Mountain"" intimacy in the great outdoors among manly men of means. It hurts me as a Westerner to say that Easterners like Grinnell were better stewards of the big land on the sunset side of the continent than many who lived there. Grinnell helped to block a plan by knuckleheads in Idaho to build a dam in Yellowstone National Park. And his fighting words kept the timber, mining and grazing interests from getting total control over our public lands. Grinnell's memory lives on in the wild. And with this book, he is given the fresh look that he deserves."

That's where Bairbre's from, too, as it happens, but after 13 years away, she's grown worldly -- far more so than Tom, who in the early days of their acquaintance batted away the flickering thought that this enchanting creature might in fact ""be one of them bad ones.""

That is to say, a prostitute. Which, up until their courtship, Bairbre had been -- a fact she conceals from her darling naif so she can make a new start with him. Rotten luck for them both, really, that when Tom takes her to meet his father, the glowering old brute remembers an evening abroad, years before, when he paid for her company.

Q. Does the National Association of Realtors have any involvement in Realtor.com? A. The brand is owned by them and licensed to us in perpetuity. But we operate the site and get all the revenue for the site. We do all the data, from rentals to new homes to listings to estimates to user-generated content. We get information from the Multiple Listing Services.

Q. Are you making an effort to get more New York City listings? A. Absolutely. The National Association of Realtors didn't allow us to take listings from nonmember-controlled M.L.S.'s, but we can now do that. So you're going to see us being very aggressive. In New York, for example, we're actually talking with the Corcoran Group and lots of the large brokerages to get their listings onto Realtor.com. They always wanted to have access to the audience. This market is a one-sided market. I grew up thinking the best way to find an apartment in New York was to talk to the doorman. Q. New York is a tough market to crack. A. You have to go to the listing agent to buy the home. It's just been that way. I don't know if they're going to change their financial arrangements, but I think they're looking to get access to the audience. Q. How much of the market nationwide are you getting over all? A. We believe we have 98 percent of the coverage in the country of M.L.S. listings, which represent a large portion of all listings, with the exception of the New York City market. We literally get 15-minute updates from 90 percent of the M.L.S.'s in the United States. So we have the single most current set of listing data.

On our mobile apps, we literally show when a house changes status, from on the market to pending sale. Q. There have been many changes in the way homes are viewed since Realtor.com came online several years ago. A. What's clear from consumers' point of view is that pictures are important, so we actually help Realtors. We do a lot of training; we have seminars on how to take the best photos; we also help them understand how to take videos. We're in the process of looking at different ways to use the mobile devices to allow people to literally upload photos. One of the more advanced areas that we'll be expanding our site into this year is the new-homes area. We have a site called NewHomeSource.com where you can literally change the colors of the rooms. That kind of technology will continue to move into the real estate space. Eventually we'd hope to be able to say to a consumer: You're looking at this house, what would it look like if you remodeled the kitchen? That'll be on Realtor.com at some point. Q. So your goal is to go beyond the listings and make the site much easier to use. A. Absolutely. One of the things we're looking at is to actually connect the property history with the house, so that we can show consumers a timeline view. We also talked about bringing in the home-improvement history and see who are the contractors that worked on a home. There are companies out there trying to aggregate these diverse sources of data.

Realtors are realizing that their role is moving beyond content. Their job is actually to bring the content together and become that trusted adviser to the consumer. Q. And with mobile apps, too? A. We use a lot of geographic location-based tools. On our mobile apps, if you're driving around the neighborhood and you press the button, it will literally show you things. We can show you right where you're standing, all the houses around where you're standing. You can draw a circle on our applications and literally say, I'd like to live on this street. Fifty percent of our traffic comes from mobile today. We have about six apps available; we update them every month. Q. Some might say you're playing catch-up with sites like Zillow or Trulia. A. No. We've been around since 1996, and so our focus has always been on the homes-for-sale side of the business. Zillow and Trulia are trying to catch up to us there. But we're actually trying to move back up the funnel. We really have to focus on bringing the Realtor brand back to consumers. A. We provide that in 70 markets, which cover about 45 percent of the coverage in the U.S. We're just bringing Boston up. We have quite a few in Florida. We get sold data within 15 minutes of the house selling. It'll tell you what agent listed the house, what agent sold the house. It was introduced about a year ago, and we're working very closely with the M.L.S.'s to expand. Q. What do you do for fun? A.

Gazzo as Frank Pentangeli in ""The Godfather: Part II.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/arts/06mobmovie/06mobmovie-facebookJumbo-v2.png?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=0d9bc0ee7daaa52b88191bc21cf14300c63cbfdf16d307e3c003834d3c91b198&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/movies/roger-stone-trial-the-godfather.html,1ffc1dfa-14d9-5b21-888d-bf9d82bad79b.jpg,"As Roger J. Stone Jr. goes on trial in Washington, accused of obstructing investigations into a possible conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, one piece of evidence has nothing to do with Russia, Hillary Clinton's emails, WikiLeaks or the Trump administration. It's Mr. Stone's mentions of a character from ""The Godfather: Part II"" who gives false testimony during a Senate hearing on organized crime. ""Do a Frank Pentangeli,"" Mr. Stone texted to an associate set to testify about him before a Congressional committee in 2017 . The message, according to prosecutors, was an attempt by Mr. Stone, a Republican political operative and longtime adviser to President Trump, to advise his associate to mimic Pentangeli's obtuseness.

""I don't know nothing about that,"" Pentangeli demurs when questioned in the 1974 film about a character's mob ties. Witnesses have been pulling Pentangelis for years, and the surfacing of the term in the Stone case is just one of the many times where elements of the ""Godfather"" films, and the book on which they were based, have become pervasive in the real world. Earlier this year, when a conservative detractor of the CNN host Chris Cuomo, whose brother, Andrew Cuomo, is governor of New York, sought to demean him, he referred to him as ""Fredo,"" the bungling sibling in the Corleone clan. When someone makes you ""an offer you can't refuse,"" or threatens to have you ""sleep with the fishes,"" they are repeating phrases largely made popular by the ""Godfather"" films. Edward McDonald, a lawyer who as a federal prosecutor secured convictions against leaders of four of New York's five Mafia families, said prosecutors are not immune from the pull of the language when chatting with colleagues. After offering a defendant a plea deal, he said, ""You might say, 'I made him an offer he can't refuse: immunity instead of 10 years in prison.'""

Even mob guys have mirrored behavior from the ""Godfather"" films on occasion, as in 1977 when prosecutors said a man acting on behalf of the Colombo crime family was trying to secretly stash bribe money in a Long Island restaurant. He chose the same place where Michael Corleone finds the gun hidden for him in ""The Godfather""-- a toilet. ""Just like in the movies,"" an undercover agent exclaimed on a wiretap after pulling the cash from the commode. Though lines from other films have become part of the American lexicon -- ""I'll be back"" (Schwarzenegger, ""The Terminator,"" 1984) -- few have had the enduring impact of the Godfather series, said Kenneth Dancyger, a professor of film and television at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He attributed that to the unique combination of skilled scriptwriting, acting and directing as well as to the film's insights into an American brand of power and corruption. ""At the heart of it,"" Professor Dancyger said, ""is family and honor and trying to protect the family from a corrupt world, which is what Don Corleone is trying to do."" The scripts for the first two Godfather films were a collaboration by its director, Francis Ford Coppola, and Mario Puzo, the author of the book by the same name.

Mr. Puzo's research materials included mob trial transcripts and hearings such as those into the Mafia boss Joseph Valachi in the 1960s, but he had no direct contact with wiseguys. ""He never met an honest-to-God gangster,"" said Puzo's oldest son, Tony Puzo, 72. ""He'd be very amused at all this Godfather stuff now,"" he said. ""He didn't understand why people loved the Godfather references, why they held it as gospel that a quote from 'The Godfather' had any relevance except for being a witty term. He didn't believe in the righteousness of mobsters. He was just writing a story.""

This weekend, on the 45th anniversary of its release, ""The Godfather: Part II"" will be screened in theaters across the country and Frankie Pentangeli's predicament will be presented to a new generation of moviegoers. In the film, Frankie has every intention of testifying against the Corleone family and has signed a sworn statement containing the incriminating information. But he reverses himself after the Corleones ferry his brother from Italy to sit prominently in the Senate hearing room, staring daggers at him. A similar scenario unfolded in 2010 when investigators said a murder defendant tried to pack a Bronx courtroom with a horde of locals to stare down a government witness from the neighborhood who was taking the stand against him. In a wiretapped call, the defendant said the ploy came from ""The Godfather"" -- ""my favorite movie of all time.""

Bruce Rogow, an attorney for Mr. Stone, had opposed the effort to screen the Pentangeli scene, calling it ""dangerous territory"" for prosecutors to mention the Mafia or mob films in court because of their potential to prejudice a jury. ""Once the door is opened with a movie clip, which no doubt will accompany an explanation of why it is being played,"" Mr. Rogow wrote in a brief last August, ""the trial detours to a Mafia trial and Stone's connection to it, with all of its history and folklore."""
60110,Germany Shuts 7 Plants as Europe Plans Safety Tests,Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said that seven older plants that began operating before 1980 would be temporarily closed.,"A plant in Biblis, Germany is among the seven that will be shut down.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/16/business/EURONUKE/EURONUKE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=313&w=600&s=8cce62b0b58ba81ca1ec187034c236f0d321b91e6399fb2644bb782c6148e932&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/business/global/16euronuke.html,8b1360ea-c013-5b89-96dc-b550c619955a.jpg,"BRUSSELS -- Germany on Tuesday became the first European country to shut nuclear plants in the wake of the crisis in Japan as the European Union made plans to test all 143 nuclear power plants in its 27 countries. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said seven plants that went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time would be used to study speedier adoption of renewable energy. All of the plants were built by German contractors. While Mrs. Merkel asserted that safety was her main concern, opposition politicians accused her of pandering to fear about nuclear power ahead of a regional election this month. She has, in effect, suspended a decision last autumn to keep older plants operating beyond their previously designated life span. The tests across the European Union are intended to ensure preparedness for emergencies like floods and tsunamis, as well as terrorist attacks, the European energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, said after meeting with representatives of the nuclear industry, electricity companies and governments.

""This is a reassessment, if you like, of all potential risks in the wake of what has happened in Japan,"" Mr. Oettinger said. The Japanese disaster has led officials in Europe and the United States to think twice about nuclear expansion. But for now, developing countries, while acknowledging the need for safety, say their energy needs give them little choice but to continue investing in nuclear power.

A crucial element, Mr. Oettinger said, would be to determine whether the plants had enough backup power to cool the reactors if electricity was lost. The loss of backup power after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan led to overheating and explosions at the Fukushima plant. Mr. Oettinger, who became energy commissioner with Mrs. Merkel's support, appeared Tuesday to shift his attitude toward nuclear energy. ""We must also raise the question if we in Europe, in the foreseeable future, can secure our energy needs without nuclear energy,"" he told the German TV station ARD.

In his native state of Baden-Wurttemberg, where Mrs. Merkel's party risks losing power in March 27 elections, Mr. Oettinger was known as a proponent of nuclear power. The state has two plants, one of which is among the seven to be shut down. On Saturday, about 50,000 protesters formed a human chain from the state capital, Stuttgart, to that reactor. On Monday, an estimated 110,000 people demonstrated in 450 towns across Germany against extending nuclear power. Both Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Oettinger said President Nicolas Sarkozy of France would raise nuclear safety at the next Group of 20 nations summit meeting. Mr. Oettinger said the tests should include as many plants in the European Union as possible. Nuclear power produces around a third of the electricity and 15 percent of the energy consumed in the European Union. The chief executive of the German power giant E.On, Johannes Teyssen, said he would welcome more common standards for European nuclear safety. He declined, however, to rule out power cutoffs as a result of Mrs. Merkel's decision, noting that ""obviously depends on several factors of demand and supply, on availability of transmission grids, on a lot of issues."" ""With this new unbalance in the system, minor accidents can have major implications,"" Mr. Teyssen said in Brussels. ""We will try our best to live up to the situation, but the risk of the system has definitely increased."" The industry made a similar threat almost a year ago when Mrs. Merkel agreed to extend the life of the power plants if the utilities paid a special tax. The utilities said the tax would hinder investment. Germany has 17 nuclear plants. They provide 26 percent of the country's electricity; the seven older reactors produce about a third of that percentage.

European operators already face narrowing choices over where to locate reactors. In France, which relies on nuclear energy for more than 75 percent of its electricity, hot water discharged by power stations can combine with rising air temperatures to warm rivers enough in the summer to threaten fish and plant life. But building plants on seafronts, where cold water is abundant, may be less attractive because of storms and rising sea levels linked to climate change.

A total of 17 reactors in the European Union use technology similar to those affected in Japan, which are known as boiling water reactors, according to the European Commission. Of those 17, nine in Finland and Sweden are on coastlines, according to the Nuclear Energy Agency, part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. About 40 percent of the reactors in the union's member states are on coastlines, according to the commission. The Continent has comparatively weak earthquakes. Even so, nature can pose a threat. During a storm in 1999, rising water levels in the Gironde River led to severe flooding at the French plant Blayais, shutting down some safety systems. Since then, Electricite de France, which runs the plant, has improved protections at Blayais. Stress tests would have common standards, Mr. Oettinger said, but ""if you have a plant which is on the coast, well then obviously flooding and tsunamis will be tested for perhaps more thoroughly than plants situated at much greater altitude."" The nuclear crisis in Japan is also complicating the debate over whether to pursue nuclear energy in Chile, which only last year suffered an 8.8-magnitude earthquake that caused devastation, officials said this week. Next week, Chile and the United States are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding on nuclear cooperation when President Obama visits Santiago. But given the disaster in Japan, Chile's energy and mining minister, Laurence Golborne, told reporters the government needed to study the situation. ""We may decide we don't want this type of energy and we will have to analyze other sources,"" he said. ""The country needs energy, and to say no to something means saying yes to other things."""
41949,More Older Couples Are 'Shacking Up',"Cohabitation is on the rise among older people, demographers report, driven by both personal and economic considerations.","Mr. Tobin supported Ms. Kanter through a successful breast cancer treatment years ago.

""We love each other and want to be together, and we've made the commitment to stay together until death parts us,"" Ms. Kanter said.



In many ways, the life that Karen Kanter and Stan Tobin share in Philadelphia sounds entirely typical. Both 75, they happily see movies and plays together, visit children and grandchildren, try new restaurants (but avoid sushi). Mr. Tobin, an accountant who maintains a small tax practice, makes time for a monthly men's group. A retired middle-school teacher, Ms. Kanter hustles between book and art appreciation groups while volunteering and writing a historical novel. He supported her through a successful breast cancer treatment years ago. She has been prodding him about putting on pounds, so he has returned to Weight Watchers. Careful about financial and legal arrangements, they co-own their condo near the Museum of Art and a cottage in upstate New York. She has his power of attorney and health care proxy, and vice versa.

""We love each other and want to be together, and we've made the commitment to stay together until death parts us,"" Ms. Kanter said. But although they have been a couple since 2002 and have shared a home since 2004, they are not married. And among older adults, they have a lot of company. The number of people over 50 who cohabit with an unmarried partner jumped 75 percent from 2007 to 2016, the Pew Research Center reported last month -- the highest increase in any age group. ""It was a striking finding,"" said Renee Stepler, a Pew research analyst. ""We often think of cohabiters as being young."" Most still are. But the number of cohabiters over age 50 rose to 4 million from 2.3 million over the decade, Ms. Stepler found, and the number over age 65 doubled to about 900,000.

So-called gray divorce has roughly doubled among those 50-plus since the 1990s. Divorce leaves two people available for repartnering, of course; losing a spouseleaves one, and these days it tends to strike at older ages. But attitudes have shifted, too. ""People who've divorced have a more expansive view of what relationships are like,"" said Deborah Carr, the Rutgers University sociologist who served as chairwoman of the Population Association panel. ""The whole idea of marriage as the ideal starts to fade, and personal happiness becomes more important."" Of course, the boomers pretty much invented widespread premarital cohabitation while in their 20s and 30s -- or like to think they did.

""It used to be called shacking up, and it was not approved of,"" said Kelly Raley, a sociologist at the University of Texas, Austin, and former editor of The Journal of Marriage and Family. Families and religious groups often condemned living together outside marriage. But Americans are far more accepting now, she said, and the people turning 60 ""are very different from the people who were 60 twenty years ago."" Karen Kanter, for instance, had divorced twice after long marriages -- 38 years, in total -- when she met Mr. Tobin on Match.com. ""Getting divorced gives you so much to untangle,"" she said. ""Our life is good together, so why disturb it? I just don't see the importance of that piece of paper."" Mr. Tobin, also divorced after a long marriage, wouldn't mind marrying his partner -- he actually proposed on bended knee once, though he knew Ms. Kanter would say no -- but he is also fine with cohabiting. ""The relationship is looser,"" he said. ""We don't make demands on each other's time. She has her life, I have my life, and we have our life together."" For older people, the advantages and drawbacks can stack up differently than at earlier ages, when such relationships tend to be more unstable. Demographers see most youthful cohabitation as a prelude to marriage or simply a short-term arrangement.

In later life, however, cohabitation -- like remarriage -- brings companionship and wider social circles, not to mention sexual intimacy, at ages when people might otherwise face isolation. Financially, pooling resources in a single household often improves elders' economic stability, especially for women, who are at higher risk for poverty. It also offers certain economic protections. Older adults have more debt than previous generations, Dr. Carr pointed out, including mortgages and children's college loans. ""You become responsible for your legal spouse's debt, but not for your cohabiting partner's debt,"" she said.

Marrying or remarrying can also affect government and pension benefits. Consider Jane Carney and Norm Stoner, who live in Oklahoma City and were both widowed. For years, even after he moved into her house in 2004, they debated whether to make their union legal. ""The list of pros was very short, and the list of cons was very long,"" said Ms. Carney, 69. Among the latter: Each was receiving Social Security survivors benefits, checks that would have stopped had they remarried. Nor will one partner's assets prevent the other from qualifying for Medicaid. Other factors become harder to quantify. Couples monitor one another's health, so cohabiters fare better, physically and mentally, than those who live alone, Dr. Carr said. But relationships with adult children sometimes suffer. Matthew Wright, a doctoral candidate in sociology at Bowling Green State University, reported at the Population Association meeting that cohabiters had less frequent contact with their children, and less positive relationships, than continuously married or widowed parents.

Cohabiters didn't differ from remarried or divorced parents, however, suggesting that marital dissolution itself, rather than the legal status of parents' new partnerships, creates those tensions. What about caregiving, then? Spouses explicitly vow to care for one another; in fact, reluctance to assume that burden can dissuade older women, especially widows, from marrying. Older cohabiters, one large national study has found, are less likely to provide care than spouses -- though when cohabiters do shoulder caregiving, they devote as much time to it as married people do. ""Maybe they'll rely more on the children,"" Dr. Carr speculated. If divorce has chilled that relationship, though, children may be less willing to step in. What happens when cohabiters reach advanced ages and ill health remains something of an open question -- but one that couples should consider. Documenting end-of-life wishes, designating health care decision-makers and writing wills is even more important than for married couples. Otherwise, state laws could thwart a cohabiter's preferences. In many ways, cohabitation among older people remains improvisational, only recently a common phenomenon, one that couples shape to suit them. ""There are no strongly established rules,"" Dr. Raley said. ""You can invent them as you go along.""

Or you can follow a marital pattern without the letter of the law. In the end, Ms. Carney and Mr. Stoner, now 74, never married. But when he developed liver disease and vascular dementia, she cared for him as if they had. And when she could no longer keep him safely in their home, she and his children agreed on a continuing care retirement community, where she visits him almost daily. Married or not, ""we were committed to each other,"" she said. ""I can't imagine his getting sick and my saying to his kids, 'It's your problem.' After 20 years? No."""

45893,Fed Lets Interest Rate Stand Ahead of Powell Nomination as Chairman,The Fed signaled a rate rise remains quite likely for December as the White House prepared to tap Jerome H. Powell as its new leader.,"Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, at a news conference in September.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/02/business/02DC-FED1/02DC-FED1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=864b4c733d1f9e219f9eb9269334160a676f518094d3af463a5aade99fc368c5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/business/economy/federal-reserve-yellen.html,3393f6b7-cbd1-5563-977b-1d829c4fe9d7.jpg,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday and signaled another rate increase is very likely to come in mid-December. But hanging over the meeting was the anticipation of a much bigger change: The nomination of Jerome H. Powell as the next Fed chairman. The Fed's current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is expected to remain in that post until her term expires in February. On Wednesday, President Trump called Ms. Yellen ""excellent."" Nevertheless, he is expected to nominate Mr. Powell, a current board member, for the Fed chairmanship at a Rose Garden event on Thursday, according to people familiar with the decision. Mr. Powell, a Republican who joined the Fed in 2012, has steadily supported Ms. Yellen's approach to monetary policy and is expected to follow a similar trajectory if confirmed to lead the central bank. Mr. Powell has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012, including its four interest rate increases and the gradual unwinding of the Fed's stimulus campaign. The meeting Wednesday was the first since the Fed began reducing its vast portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which it acquired in an effort to stimulate the economy during and after the 2008 financial crisis.

The Fed is approaching the process cautiously, and so far investors appear unfazed. The central bank is paring its $4.2 trillion in bond holdings by just $10 billion per month through the end of this year, then gradually increasing the pace until it reaches a monthly rate of $50 billion. At the conclusion of its two-day gathering in Washington, the Fed announced that it would leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1 and 1.25 percent, after lifting it twice so far this year. The vote was unanimous, and the central bank did not alter any of the careful wording in its statement about its expected rate of future increases -- a sign that it is not trying to quell widely held expectations of a rate increase of a quarter point in December. ""They're on track to raise rates in December,"" said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities. In its statement, the Fed said economic activity had been rising ""at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions."" It said that the hurricanes had caused a drop in payrolls in September and a pickup in inflation because of higher gasoline prices, but that it expected both effects to be temporary, and that the storms would be ""unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."" The last time the Fed met, in September, large parts of the United States were still reeling from hurricanes that threatened to disrupt economic activity in several major cities. Two weeks later, the government reported that the economy had lost jobs in September for the first time in seven years, a decline most experts attributed to the storms' impact.

Since then, however, economic data has indicated that the economy weathered the storms without lasting damage. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services, rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter of the year, the second straight quarter of solid growth. Measures of retail sales and consumer confidence have likewise been strong, and most economists expect the next round of employment figures, due Friday, to show a solid rebound from September's dip. ""Much of the uncertainty that had existed at the September meetings because of the hurricanes has subsided and signs are that growth has been stronger,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. The one sticking point remains inflation. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation is well below the central bank's 2 percent target; what's more, inflation has slowed this year even as the unemployment rate has fallen, a trend that would ordinarily be expected to put upward pressure on prices. That disconnect has complicated the Fed's plans to raise interest rates at the steady clip it has signaled, including three more times next year. Ms. Yellen and most of her colleagues have expressed confidence that the slowdown in inflation is temporary and therefore should not force a change in plans. In a September speech, Ms. Yellen said that low unemployment is leading to pay increases, which will ultimately lead to higher prices as well; other Fed officials have made similar comments in recent weeks. Still, at some point ""temporary"" effects stop looking so temporary. The Fed will get several more reports on inflation before its December meeting, and it remains possible that weak data could give policymakers pause. Financial markets appear all but certain that the Fed plans to raise rates in December. Futures contracts on Wednesday morning suggested investors saw a 96.7 percent probability of a rate increase at the Fed's next meeting, according to CME Group. Matthew Hornbach, global head of interest-rate strategy for Morgan Stanley, said the Fed had sent a clear signal that it was prepared to raise rates even if inflation stays low in the coming months. But Ken Matheny, executive director of Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, was less certain that a December rise was inevitable. He said that the Fed was struggling to reconcile strong growth with weak inflation, and that policymakers would be watching coming inflation data closely in making their interest-rate decisions.

""A December rate hike is not a foregone conclusion,"" Mr. Matheny said, adding that the market's overwhelming confidence in an increase was ""a puzzle."" Policymakers and investors have also been watching closely for any signs that the Fed's long-awaited process of drawing down on its $4.2 trillion balance sheet is disrupting financial markets. In 2013, interest rates spiked unexpectedly in response to the Fed's announcement that it would begin slowing its bond purchases, a reaction that came to be known as the ""taper tantrum."" So far, there is little sign of trouble. Interest rates have edged up since the Fed announced its plans in September, but the stock market has continued to rise and there has been no hint of another tantrum. In a speech last month, Ms. Yellen said the asset-reduction process seemed to be going smoothly so far. ""I'm sure they're very relieved at the reaction they got,"" said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Investors said the nomination of Mr. Powell would mean that the Fed was likely to continue on its current course. A former Treasury Department official under President George H.W. Bush and a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, Mr. Powell emerged as the front-runner for the position in recent weeks from a diverse group of finalists. That group included Gary Cohn, a close economic adviser to the president; John B. Taylor, an economist who is a vocal critic of the Fed; and Ms. Yellen herself. Mr. Trump has the opportunity to significantly reshape the Federal Reserve through appointments. Mr. Trump has appointed just one board member so far, the former Treasury official Randal K. Quarles, as the vice chairman for supervision, who voted for the first time on Wednesday."

Mike Trout, the center fielder for the Los Angeles Angels, is finalizing a contract extension that will be worth about $430 million and keep him with the team through 2030, according to two people who were briefed on the deal but were not authorized to comment publicly. However the deal is calculated -- either an additional $360 million over 10 years or the Angels' total commitment of about $430 million for the next 12 years -- Trout has eclipsed the previous record for guaranteed money: the 13-year, $330 million deal Bryce Harper signed this month with the Philadelphia Phillies. The extension, which was first reported by ESPN, would establish Trout as the highest-paid baseball player on an annual basis, topping the $34.4 million Zack Greinke is earning from the Arizona Diamondbacks on a six-year, $206.5 million contract signed in December 2015. [From 2017: Mike Trout, Baseball's Best Without the Brand] While it is an enormous amount of money, even this record-breaking contract doesn't necessarily bring Trout into the highest tier of overall income for professional athletes.

While comparing contracts across sports and continents is an inherently difficult undertaking because of varied contractual structures, tax burdens, bonuses and ancillary benefits, it is clear that even with the monster deal Trout would fall well short of becoming the world's highest paid athlete annually. The soccer superstar Lionel Messi, for example, is expected to earn more than 106 million euros (about $120 million) per year from Barcelona through 2021, an amount that could rise to 120 million euros if certain incentives are met. The boxer Canelo Alvarez will earn at least $73 million annually from a five-year deal with the streaming service DAZN. Trout, 27, also won't have the highest annual salary in North American team sports. In the N.B.A., Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors is making $37.5 million this season, and the Houston Rockets' James Harden will earn $42.3 million annually once his four-year, $169.3 million contract extension kicks in. The highest-paid N.F.L. player, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, earns a bit less than Trout is expected to: an average of $33.5 million from a four-year, $134 million contract (though only $98.7 million of that is guaranteed). Unlike Major League Baseball, the N.F.L. and N.B.A. have salary caps. Compared with superstars in other sports, Trout has a limited ability to earn money outside the game. Baseball players typically aren't as well-known nationally or internationally as their counterparts in other major sports, and Trout's lack of marketability has been lamented by M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred.

Trout does have a number of endorsement deals with companies including Rawlings and Nike, and in 2014 he became of the first baseball player since Ken Griffey Jr. to get a Nike signature cleat. But baseball players' ability to move merchandise pales in comparison to that of a basketball player or a soccer player, and endorsement contracts reflect that. Trout earns an estimated $2.5 million from endorsements annually, according to Forbes. Kevin Durant's endorsement deal with Nike alone is worth up to $300 million over 10 years, while Harden will earn $200 million over 13 years from Adidas. LeBron James of the N.B.A. and Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese soccer star for Juventus, have lifetime deals with Nike that are rumored to be worth $1 billion each. While a handful of athletes earn more from their contracts annually than Trout, those individuals almost assuredly will not be doing so in 2030, the final year of Trout's deal. N.B.A. contracts last a maximum of five years, and with a few exceptions, soccer contracts are rarely longer than that, either. Boxers typically earn their money fight to fight, while golf and tennis players simply claim a share of tournament prize money. But in 2030, no matter how Trout's baseball career progresses, he will earn at least $36 million -- a priceless long-term assurance. He has earned the payout by putting together seven astounding seasons to begin his career; the most similar players, production-wise, at his age, according to Baseball Reference, have been the Hall of Famers Frank Robinson, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mickey Mantle. Trout has won two American League Most Valuable Player Awards and been the runner-up four times. His career batting average is .307 and he is the majors' active leader in on-base plus slugging percentage, at .990. But, adding to Trout's lack of recognition and earning power, postseason success has eluded him. He has reached the playoffs just once, in 2014, when the Angels were swept by the Kansas City Royals in a division series. The possibility of Trout departing for a new team loomed after the 2020 season, when his six-year, $144.5 million contract was set to expire; Harper, for one, had said he would love for Trout to join him in Philadelphia. Trout still lives in his hometown, Millville, N.J., in the off-season, and is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan. But the Angels had tried to impress upon Trout the benefits of keeping his work and home lives separate, and to sell him on the idea of being a one-team icon with a franchise with which he has thrived. And with a promise of an enormous paycheck -- at least for on-field performance -- the Angels put together a winning pitch."

Galleries participating in art fairs tend to judge their success by the numbers -- not only profits from their sales but also how many new collectors they met who stay in touch. But for visitors, what matters most is less quantifiable: Was the fair experience memorable? And how was the art? For many viewers reached by a reporter and photographer for The New York Times, the inaugural edition of Frieze Los Angeles and the upstart Felix LA art fair last weekend succeeded on those fronts, dispelling a longstanding notion of the city as a graveyard for art fairs and underscoring its vitality as an art center. Frieze, set at Paramount Studios, commissioned artworks for the five-acre New York streetscape on the backlot and they helped to give the fair a different vibe, from Hannah Greely's paintings of laundry on a clotheslines to Sarah Cain's wall-to-window takeover of a classic brownstone apartment, including a brilliant stained-glass window. In the big tent housing 70 gallery booths there were many discoveries to be made. They ranged from a stridently colored, puzzle-like painting of female factory workers by the little-known Sacramento artist Irving Marcus (age 89) at Parker Gallery to a reconstruction of Judy Chicago's important 1965 ""Zig Zag"" sculpture at Jeffrey Deitch.

Hans Ulrich Obrist, the artistic director of Serpentine Galleries in London, who typically leads two to three trips a year for patrons, called his trip ""one of the most exciting we've ever had."" He praised the ""village-like experience of the Paramount lot,"" the fair's manageable size (less than half that of Frieze New York) and the various satellite fairs and pop-up events around it.

The popular Felix art fair, which had free entry and was intended to show more affordable art, commandeered several poolside cabana rooms and the entire 11th floor of the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel. Visitors could see unframed paintings by Roger White spread out on a bed and putty sculptures by Matt Hoyt posed on hotel end tables rather than museum pedestals. The lobby had a spread of Kristen Morgin's painted clay replicas of books that she imagined came from Jennifer Aniston's library, with titles heavy on romance and self-help."

The second approach was to use a well-known model of biodiversity as a basis for making predictions. ""If you know the number of individuals, you can predict the most abundant species,"" Dr. Locey said.

""So we used those two inputs -- the number of individuals over all and the number of individuals belonging to the most abundant species -- to estimate the total number of species.""

The two methods provided numbers that matched: Earth contains 10^11 to 10^12 species of microbes.

""We think our approach was rigorous in that we used a theoretical prediction and a statistical estimate,"" he said. ""We ended up with intersecting predictions based on different methods.""

Finding the number of species has broader implications, Dr. Locey said. ""How many species could have actually evolved in four billion years? What are the upper constraints of evolution on Earth? How many species have evolved, how many could have evolved?"
17905,"Hotel Review: Paramount House Hotel, Sydney",A new hotel becomes another hot place for the hip to congregate — sometimes in droves — in the fashionable Surry Hills neighborhood.,A balcony off a loft room is afforded privacy by the copper chevron screen on the exterior of the building.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/travel/17checkin-sydney1/17checkin-sydney-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=63977c45c251efe8f90e3637a40d5cf19db4e4f938df0f60d6140e6267a0ec8a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/travel/hotel-review-paramount-house-hotel-sydney.html,e9d51772-8780-522c-bd90-5c748db7c444.jpg,"A new hotel becomes another hot place for the hip to congregate -- sometimes in droves -- in the fashionable Surry Hills neighborhood.

From 225 Australian dollars (about $170 at current exchange rates). The former headquarters of Paramount Pictures Australia (a subsidiary of the fabled Paramount Pictures Corporation , the Hollywood motion-picture company) was given new life in 2013 when the Paramount Coffee Project and Golden Age Cinema & Bar opened in the 1940 Art Deco building. A co-working space soon followed, and together, these businesses became an au courant local hub. Its reach expanded in April with the 29-room Paramount House Hotel, occupying the attached onetime film-storage warehouse. I arrived at 10 a.m. , well before the 3 p.m. check-in time, and navigated a Saturday brunch madhouse at the Coffee Project, all blond wood and polished concrete, to reach the reception desk. My room wasn't ready, but the hotel emailed me when it was, and I checked in around 1:30. The staff had already deposited my bags into my room. Surry Hills, a low-slung neighborhood of creative businesses, buzzy cafes and 19th-century terraced houses, has long attracted Sydney's trendsetters. But until the Paramount House, it didn't have a destination hotel befitting its wider allure. Hyde Park is a short walk away, as is the Central Business District.

The first level of my loft room was equal parts open bathroom and seating area. A lattice window slid open onto a balcony, making the room feel bigger. Augmenting the effect was a rare sight in a hotel room: three large, thriving plants. Privacy was afforded by the copper chevron screen encasing the upper floors of the building's exterior. Swank leather chairs sat on a kilim rug covering the wood floor and facing the room's only TV. In lieu of a closet, a clothes rack hung next to the sink. Upstairs, the bed was made up with sumptuous French linens from the Australian brand Cultiver and framed by sconces too dim for reading, plus power and USB outlets.

The bathroom was a stunner, with generous use of Italian terrazzo tiling, brass accents and a gorgeous wooden bathtub that was nearly impossible to shower in. The curtains clung to me, and the Aesop products sat outside the curtain at bathing level. So I gave up and took a bath. Form won out over function here.

The hotel suggests that guests reserve by 4:30 p.m. to guarantee a spot at its small-plates restaurant, Poly, for the same evening. I did so and was told it was fully booked, but my party of one could squeeze in. When I arrived, there was no reservation for me but they sat me at the bar. I ordered the Paramount cocktail, a great twist on a negroni with lemongrass and Pampelle, a grapefruit liqueur. My food order included flatbread topped with a whipped sesame spread and a salad made with gem cos, a lettuce that was new to me. Both were unusual and delicious. By the time I left, the room was packed with the most beautiful people I saw in Sydney during my four days there. Room service breakfast from the Coffee Project arrived promptly. Given their coffee's renown, the sippy cup half-filled with undrinkable brew came as a surprise. (The flat white I ordered in the coffee shop itself was far better.) The rest -- sourdough toast, overnight oats and orange juice -- was tasty and came in an ingenious stacking contraption that minimized necessary table space.

In place of a gym, guests have free access to classes at the top-floor Paramount Recreation Club. Unfortunately, the schedule was limited during my weekend stay. In a nod to the building's moviemaking past, the basement cinema shows films in the original Paramount screening room, while its adjacent cocktail bar is a draw in its own right. Wi-Fi was complementary and fast. Turndown service included a bedside carafe of water with mint and an orange slice."

The renown of ""Impeach the President,"" which he wrote and produced, tended to overshadow his long, rich soul music career, which predated that track and lasted decades beyond it.





Roy Hammond, a soul singer, songwriter and producer with an impressive catalog in the 1960s and '70s who produced a song that became one of hip-hop's foundational samples, died on Sept. 16 at his home in Allendale, S.C. He was 81. His daughter Sabrina Hammond-Williams said the cause was liver cancer. Mr. Hammond wrote and produced the Honey Drippers' ""Impeach the President,"" a political funk barnstormer released in 1973 as the Watergate scandal unfolded around President Richard M. Nixon. It was resuscitated just over a decade later by the Queens hip-hop producer Marley Marl, who sampled its crisp drum intro for MC Shan's ""The Bridge."" Released in 1986, that track caused a tectonic shift in the sound of New York rap. ""That snare? Crack,"" Marley Marl said in a phone interview. ""Any song that used it, that was a hit.""

Roy Charles Hammond was born on Aug. 3, 1939, in Newington, Ga., to George and Annie Joy Hammond. His father was a railroad worker, and his mother was a homemaker. As a teenager he moved to New York, where his dream of becoming a professional boxer ended with a rough sparring session with the heavyweight Hurricane Jackson. Mr. Hammond turned to music in the late 1950s, singing tenor in a short-lived doo-wop outfit, the Genies. By 1965 he had re-emerged as a solo performer, going by Roy C (often stylized as Roy ""C""). His first hit, ""Shotgun Wedding,"" in 1965, was his biggest, with wry lyrics about the consequences of sexual liberty: ""Your father's got the gun/And there ain't no place to run."" He formed his own label, Alaga Records, in 1970 and released music on it for several years before signing with Mercury and recording three albums on that label: ""Sex and Soul"" (1973), ""Something Nice"" (1975) and ""More Sex & More Soul"" (1977). Romantic mischief and infidelity was a favorite theme: His first album included the songs ""I Found a Man in My Bed"" and ""I'm Gonna Love Somebody Else's Woman (Somebody's Lovin' Mine).""

""Shotgun Wedding,"" released in 1965, was Mr. Hammond's first hit. Romantic mischief and infidelity was a favorite theme of his. Mr. Hammond was also preoccupied with politics and history. In 1971, he recorded a Vietnam War protest song, ""Open Letter to the President."" His album ""Sex and Soul"" featured ""I Wasn't There (but I Can Feel the Pain),"" a song about slavery. The later ""More Sex and More Soul"" featured ""Great, Great Grandson of a Slave."" After that album, Mr. Hammond met with the president of Mercury. ""He was trying to tell me that they were not interested in that type of music,"" he said of his political songs in an interview with the music magazine Wax Poetics in 2011. ""They thought I would be much bigger if I didn't put out those types of songs."" Ms. Hammond-Williams said, ""My father was outspoken, and the way he would speak out was through his music.""

""I worked hard with the drummer because he wasn't as good a drummer as I would have liked to have,"" he told Wax Poetics. ""I remember drilling him over and over in that basement in Jamaica, Queens."" It worked: The drum pattern that kicks off the track is now an indelible part of hip-hop history. Mr. Hammond brought ""Impeach the President"" to Mercury, however, the label ""refused to do it,"" he told Vice last year. ""I think they was afraid."" Though not popular in its day, ""Impeach the President"" made it into the crates of the early pioneer hip-hop D.J.s Afrika Bambaataa and Kool Herc. ""Number one, that was a staple in the streets already -- that's why I started using it in sampling,"" Marley Marl said. ""Every time we would throw it on in the park, people would go crazy."" After it was heard in MC Shan's ""The Bridge,"" ""Impeach the President"" was included in ""Ultimate Breaks & Beats,"" a vinyl compilation series of producer-friendly funk and soul, cementing its place in hip-hop's canon. It was widely sampled from then on -- in the Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Unbelievable,"" 2Pac's ""I Get Around,"" LL Cool J's ""Around the Way Girl,"" Janet Jackson's ""That's the Way Love Goes"" and countless other tracks. Mr. Hammond's first album for Mercury Records, released in 1973, included a song about slavery, which didn't go over well with the label's president. While Mr. Hammond never experienced crossover success, he retained a significant following, especially among aficionados of Southern soul.

His music sounded like ""garage soul,"" said Joe McEwen, a former soul music journalist and radio D.J. and the senior vice president of A&R at Concord Music Group. ""There was something a little rawer about the production of his records."" Mr. Hammond married Eddie Bernice Carpenter in 1966, and she survives him. In addition to Ms. Hammond-Williams, his other survivors include two other daughters, Glendina Hammond Martin and Deborah Hammond Creech; three brothers, Jack, Ernest and Willie B. Hammond; a sister, Lessie Mae Hammond Anderson; four grandsons; and four granddaughters. In 1988, Mr. Hammond opened a pair of businesses in Allendale: a record store, Carolina Record Distributors, and a label, Three Gems, on which he released his own records for decades. Until the coronavirus pandemic, he was still performing concerts -- ""You'd see that Cadillac up and down the road, him and my mother,"" Ms. Hammond-Williams said. Mr. Hammond remained convinced of the value of music as a vehicle for political agitation. Last year, in his interview with Vice, he said he was considering recording a new version of ""Impeach the President,"" motivated by his frustration with President Trump. ""There's a man in the White House, he should be gone,"" he sang in the interview. ""There's a man in the White House, he should be somewhere else."""

The website, which is owned by Vox Media, has hired Rachel Levin for the position. Ms. Levin is a freelance writer who has covered that city extensively and has also reported on food and restaurants for publications such as The New Yorker, Sunset and The New York Times. She will join Ryan Sutton, who reviews high-end restaurants in New York; Robert Sietsema, whose beat is New York's more affordable restaurants; and Bill Addison, the site's restaurant editor, who covers restaurants across the country.

In an email, Amanda Kludt, Eater's editor in chief, said that since Ms. Levin will be the only Eater reviewer in San Francisco, she is likely to concentrate on midrange and affordable restaurants. She will be ""hitting the very high and very low end only occasionally,"" Ms. Kludt said.

As for why Eater decided on San Francisco, a city awash in money from the technology industry, Ms. Kludt said it was chosen in part because of its dynamic restaurant scene, which includes affordable options and a number of high-end tasting-menu restaurants. ""The concentration of capital in the Bay Area continues to impact the area's restaurant scene in a way that's relevant to a national audience,"" she added, ""so any investment we can make in our coverage in the region is an important one."" Finally, she cited the fact that restaurant criticism in San Francisco has been in the same hands for decades, so Eater thought it would be a good idea to add a new voice."

Today I had a hankering for a pile of tender surnoli (above), the subject of my ""Eat"" column in this weekend's magazine. Surnoli are tangy Konkani pancakes, about the size of a diner's silver dollars, and the batter is made from rice and coconut, fermented with yogurt.

These pancakes are fat and puffy and full of holes, cooked only on one side. And if you eat them hot, they'll still be filled with a sweet coconut-scented steam.

This gets us to Monday. Eggplant happens to be really good right now, and there are so many varieties at the market. You could mix it up with any of those, or go with reliable Italian eggplant to make Sarah Jampel's silky eggplant salad with almond salsa. It's one of those salads that's sturdy enough to be a meal, with little pieces of crisp cheese, and a big smear of garlicky yogurt.

Tuesday I'm on a deadline, and that means rice for dinner. Specifically, I'm looking at Genevieve Ko's quick toasted coconut rice with greens and fried eggs, the yolks still nice and runny, seasoned simply with sesame seeds, soy sauce and sriracha."

Lips scream here, hands clench, a woman in a gray peignoir walks up and down, a restive ghost. These refined frights are yours courtesy of ""Beckett in the City: The Women Speak,"" a strikingly acted and indifferently site-specific presentation of four Samuel Beckett shorts, presented by Ireland's Company SJ and the Irish Arts Center.

After gathering at the arts center, the audience treks on foot to a ""secret location"" nearby. The one-acts are scattered among three sepulchral rooms, and attendants with flashlights guide you from one to the next. Under Sarah Jane Scaife's direction, Brid Ni Neachtain performs ""Not I,"" Michele Forbes ""Footfalls,"" Joan Davis ""Rockaby."" Then all three women gather for ""Come and Go."" In between the performances, video sequences show the women looking somber inside the rooms and stairwells of a different dilapidated building, presumably somewhere in Dublin where the play was first produced.

Each Beckett short is a mordant miniature of a woman's life, mostly unlived. All of the pieces restrict a woman in some way, reducing her to a gabbling mouth or a pair of creeping feet or a body entombed in a rocking chair. Even in ""Come and Go,"" the gentlest of the short plays, the women's bodies are hidden beneath sacklike coats, their faces masked by cloche hats pulled over the eyes. (Beckett has a thing for confinement -- the ashcans of ""Endgame,"" the sand burial of ""Happy Days."")

Beckett's text describes women unable to speak or to stop speaking, to move or to stop moving. A projection shows an article from the Irish Constitution that ""recognizes that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved"" and promises ""that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labor to the neglect of their duties in the home."" This video still underscores the sense of confinement and suggests the psychic toll that well-intentioned dictums like these exact. The Irish actress Lisa Dwan gave a virtuosic performance of three of these plays at the Brooklyn Academy of Music a few years ago. The acting here has less obvious brilliance, but it more powerfully articulates the theme of powerlessness. The stirring actresses use their lined faces and roughened voices (Ms. Forbes's more girlish tones aside) to fill out the material, making the experience less abstract and maybe more terrifying.

Still, it's tough to maintain an air of horror and extremity when each vignette is preceded by a good-natured scramble for floor cushions, stools and folding chairs. (No rockers.) This ""secret location,"" unlike the atmospheric Dublin site in the video, is fairly generic. With the exception of some oversized radiators, it has long been denuded of any architectural nuance. So it seemed silly to wander from one black box to the next, especially when this relative freedom of movement contrasted with the imprisonment of the women onstage."
24548,NPR Selects Voice of America Boss as Its New Leader,"John Lansing, who started his career as a teenage cameraman in Kentucky, will start his new job as chief of the public broadcaster in October.",John Lansing testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee in July.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/07/business/06NPR-print/06NPR-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b2eb65b74d25bd3d558506b9f9f3606ca6b291d80a0f6a5b4afc1151ddab8c09&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/business/media/npr-john-lansing.html,a3866208-4549-5131-a72e-b1331ee39638.jpg,"NPR, the public radio and podcasting giant, has a new leader after years of growth and internal turmoil. Its new president and chief executive is John Lansing, a former cable executive who for the last five years has run the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the federally funded organization behind broadcasters like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Lansing, 62, praised NPR as a home of high-quality journalism and audio production, and said that in addition to supporting traditional radio broadcasting he wanted to help NPR further its expansion into areas like podcasts, where the radio network has already been a leader. ""You have shows like 'All Things Considered' and 'Morning Edition,' which will continue to be broadcasting tent poles,"" Mr. Lansing said. ""At the same time, we have to think creatively. Podcasting in particular allows NPR to reach audiences that are not necessarily tied to a radio.""

Paul Haaga, the chairman of NPR's board, said in a statement that Mr. Lansing was ""a listener and a collaborative leader with a passion for our public service journalistic mission who will help us continue to expand the audience for our storytelling."" According to Nielsen data supplied by NPR, its programs and newscasts had an overall audience of 27.4 million in spring 2019. Podtrac, which measures the audiences of podcast publishers, has consistently placed NPR at the top of its monthly rankings. For July, NPR's 60 active shows -- among them ""Planet Money,"" ""Fresh Air"" and ""Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!"" -- were downloaded 141 million times and had nearly 21 million listeners in the United States, according to Podtrac. Mr. Lansing will start in October, replacing Jarl Mohn, who has run NPR since 2014. Mr. Mohn led the push into podcasting and helped stabilize the organization after years of management turnover and budget deficits. In Mr. Mohn's first full year on the job, NPR operated in the black after having run a deficit for five of the six preceding years. For the year that ended last September, NPR reported $241 million in expenses.

Yet Mr. Mohn's tenure was also marked by a sexual harassment scandal involving a senior news executive whom he had hired and a labor clash with hundreds of union workers. In 2017, Michael Oreskes, NPR's senior vice president for news, left after two women accused him of unwanted physical advances in the 1990s, when he was the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times. Mr. Mohn was pressed about his leadership in a tense NPR interview and later apologized to employees for not taking action sooner. Mr. Lansing, who began his career as a teenage cameraman at a television station in Kentucky, spent two decades at Scripps Networks. At the U.S. Agency for Global Media -- known until last year as the Broadcasting Board of Governors -- he presided over 53 percent growth in the weekly audience for the agency's networks over the last three years, to 345 million. The agency has an annual budget of $808 million. Mr. Lansing's colleagues attribute the growth to his embrace of digital formats and the understanding of audiences that he gleaned from the private sector. ""We are different from other federal agencies,"" said Grant K. Turner, the agency's chief financial officer. ""We are not just putting out regulations or policies and paperwork. It's a real business with real market dynamics."" Networks like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are meant to counter disinformation from foreign governments by broadcasting objective reports, although they have always been dogged by an accusation that they are a form of American propaganda. Mr. Lansing rejected that accusation, saying that the agency was independent by law. Last year, however, the U.S. Agency for Global Media came under fire when it emerged that it had bought Facebook ads targeting American citizens, in violation of laws meant to protect Americans from domestic propaganda. A review by the House Foreign Affairs Committee faulted the agency for insufficient oversight but noted that an internal task force was already ""having an impact."" In an interview, Mr. Lansing called the ads a ""rogue incident"" and said it had been corrected."

The preferred word? Local. Travelers can now sign up through hotels and tour operators for experiences arranged by locals. The latest to join the trend are Marriott International, which recently took a stake in PlacePass, the tour- and activity-booking start-up, and Royal Caribbean Cruises, which just introduced GoBe, a seller -- online and through an app -- of land-based tours and activities. The experiences can be as varied as the grand and the unexpected. On PlacePass, guests can book a private tour of ""Downton Abbey"" filming locations, pasta-making lessons with a local celebrity chef or family-friendly outings. The new moves by these established companies reflect the increasing draw of home-sharing sites like Airbnb, which promise travelers the chance to live like a local, said Fiona O'Donnell, the director of travel and leisure research at Mintel, a market research firm, in Chicago. ""Guests want to feel like they are experiencing something in the design or the local flavor,"" she said. ""They want it to be memorable and part of the local scene, not like they are tourists.""

The moves are also an extension of a trend where hotels are moving away from a uniform experience, no matter where they are, to one in which properties blend into their communities and offer travelers access to local artists and businesses. Hotel operators already have a trove of data about the preferences and behavior of their frequent guests, said Bjorn Hanson, a professor at the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University. Now, he said, the hotels are using that data to get travelers to spend more money when they visit. ""Growth is slowing, so they have to shift their model to target more spending"" per guest, he said. Last year, Airbnb started its own Trips booking site, on which local ""experts"" sell experiences they put together, like a seven-hour day working and dining in an urban garden with a Los Angeles documentary filmmaker, or a three-day burlesque dancing class in London, complete with a workshop on making nipple tassels. TripAdvisor, the online travel booking site, bought Viator three years ago. The booking site's nonhotel revenue rose 31 percent last year, while revenue from its main hotel-booking business was down slightly. The start-up Hello Scout offers concierge service and activities booking via its website and text message for independent boutique hotels in six cities, including New York, San Francisco and Seattle. Hotel guests use it to text local experts to book events, or find restaurants or other hangouts. Travelers pay a fee for the bookings, and the service is free to the hotels.

There are also start-ups that connect travelers with locals for dining-in experiences, like BonAppetour, where guests can book lunch or dinner at the home of a chef in Rome or go to a Parisian dinner party in a 19th-century apartment near the Champs-Elysees. At the Stafford Hotel in London, the executive concierge, Frank Laino, created and is the host of a walking tour for guests to his favorite places in the St. James neighborhood, including visits to places not open to the public like Spencer House, Princess Diana's ancestral home, and Lock & Company, the world's oldest hat shop. Marriott's investment in PlacePass -- the amount wasn't disclosed -- adds to its existing membership rewards program, which it had been building into an ""experiences marketplace,"" where points could be redeemed for local music, sports, food and dining, and cultural activities. The technology will be incorporated into the mobile app that hotel rewards members use to check in and out and to unlock their room doors. Marriott is using big data technology to analyze and interpret customer activity on the app and to make suggestions about PlacePass experiences to try, whether or not that customer is currently staying at a Marriott property. ""Marriott is adding value to consumer lives besides just a bed in a hotel room,"" Stephanie Linnartz, the company's global chief commercial officer, said. Marriott sees its Moxy brand as a boutique hotel with the heart of a hostel, Vicki Poulos, the brand director, said. The hotels are typically in urban settings that are destinations for travelers seeking a new experience, Ms. Poulos said, different from a hotel in a suburb where travelers are not necessarily staying over to learn something new. ""We're really making sure we infuse that local culture,"" she said. ""People are determined to get to know what the community has to offer."""

Responding to Education Secretary Arne Duncan's promise to grant states waivers to the education law's most onerous provisions if Congress failed to rewrite it, the committee chairman, Representative John Kline of Minnesota, sent Mr. Duncan a letter on Thursday demanding that he explain by July 1 the legal authority that he believed he had to issue the waivers.

Mr. Kline went further in a conference call with reporters, criticizing the administration's use of the $5 billion Race to the Top grant competition to get states to adopt its reform agenda.

""He's not the nation's superintendent,"" Mr. Kline said of Mr. Duncan, who assumed powers greater than any of his predecessors when, in 2009, Congress voted $100 billion in economic stimulus money for the nation's school systems and allowed the secretary to decide how much of it should be spent."
56942,Rebuilding a Block to Greet the Met Museum,"A flurry of construction is underway near the Whitney Museum of American Art's Marcel Breuer building, which is to be taken over by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.","""I would say that the block is as transformed as any block in New York City,"" said Daniel E. Straus, who bought the buildings from the Whitney.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/24/business/Uppereast2/Uppereast2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2014&h=549&w=1050&s=844bace973a11b43b4719c85c033e7d284ba593c92901bb3ce79aefb05631c6b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/realestate/commercial/rebuilding-a-block-to-greet-the-met-museum.html,97645d36-55c6-58f6-904f-d5a8931d069a.jpg,"For nearly half a century, the Whitney Museum of American Art's Marcel Breuer building has dominated Madison Avenue and 75th Street. But with the Metropolitan Museum of Art preparing to take over the space, a flurry of construction -- including what may be an Apple store -- could be construed as the Met effect. In October, the Whitney closed its doors in anticipation of its move to a space designed by Renzo Piano that is scheduled to open in the meatpacking district in May. But the Brutalist style Breuer building, which opened in 1966, will not stay dark long. It will reopen to the public in March 2016 as a satellite location for the Met to showcase contemporary and modern art. When the Met arrives on Madison Avenue, it will find a block that has been substantially altered. The starkest change is happening next door, where six 19th-century brownstones on Madison Avenue, along with two neighboring townhouses on East 74th Street, are being converted to condos and retailing.

It has been reported that Apple will open a store at 940 Madison Avenue in the United States Mortgage and Trust Company building, a limestone and marble building from 1922 designed by the architect Henry Otis Chapman. Apple has made no announcement about a new location and has declined to comment on its plans. However, work is now being done at the 92-year-old building. Luxury retailers are increasingly drawn to the area. In October, the German fashion designer Tomas Maier opened a boutique next door to Carolina Herrera on Madison Avenue north of East 75th Street. And last month, the French fashion designer Roland Mouret opened a 1,400-square-foot flagship directly across the street from the Breuer building. ""I would say that the block is as transformed as any block in New York City,"" said Daniel E. Straus, a health care magnate who bought the collection of brownstones and a townhouse from the Whitney in 2010. The brownstones, which date to the 19th century, have been gutted, leaving only the facades, to make way for 10 luxury condos at 33 East 74th Street and 17,300 square feet of retail space at 935 Madison Avenue. One of the brownstones, which was stripped of its historic detail in the 1930s, was demolished. The changes seal the block's future as a tourist destination. An Apple store would most likely be a major draw, as the company's flagship store at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street is frequently mobbed with shoppers and tourists alike. And the Breuer building could receive a substantial increase in visitors.

""There will be a lot of people who will be walking between the two buildings and experiencing all that Madison Avenue has to offer,"" said Matthew A. Bauer, the president of the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District. ""This block is going to go from being an Upper East Side block to being a must-see,"" said Joel E. Isaacs, the president of Isaacs and Company, which is marketing the retail space at 935 Madison Avenue. Even without the Met, Madison Avenue is a shopping magnet, with retailers steadily inching north from East 57th Street. Asking rent for retail space is about $1,500 a square foot on Madison Avenue in the mid-70s, not much lower than the $1,800 a square foot retailers pay on Madison around East 57th Street, according to Faith Hope Consolo, the chairwoman of the Retail Group at Douglas Elliman Real Estate. ""They're at the right place at the right time,"" said Ms. Consolo of the 935 Madison Avenue development. ""But you know what? Retailers are mad for Madison."" But when Mr. Straus bought the properties from the Whitney for $95 million in 2010, the block's future was not entirely settled. The Whitney had already decided to leave the Upper East Side, but it had not found a tenant for the Breuer building. It wasn't until 2011 that the Met announced its intention to sign an eight-year lease with the Whitney. ""I would love to take credit for brilliance, but I think it's really fortuitous,"" Mr. Straus said. For decades, the brownstones and townhouses that neighbor the Breuer building have had an uncertain fate. Over the years, the Whitney made various attempts to transform them into additional museum space, fielding designs by the star architects Michael Graves, Rem Koolhaas and Mr. Piano, none of which were ever realized. Known as the Whitney brownstones, the six that line Madison Avenue were built in the 1870s in the Italianate and Greek Revival styles. One of the properties, a 33-foot-wide mansion designed by the architect Grosvenor Atterbury on East 74th Street, was built in 1901.

""They're very workaday classic New York brownstones,"" said Tara Kelly, the executive director of Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts. ""But their significance rises to a higher level because of their proximity to the Breuer building."" Over the years, the Whitney used the properties as office space with retailers on the ground floor. But after the museum committed to a new space overlooking the High Line park, it sold the parcels to raise money for the project. Because the properties are in a landmark district, Mr. Straus had to win approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the design by Beyer Blinder Belle, which includes a three-story penthouse addition. The 14,300 square feet of retailing, spread over the ground and basement levels, could be divided into as many as five storefronts. The ground floor space will have 18-foot ceilings. The ceilings in the basement level will be 10 feet high. Some preservationists have raised concerns about the redesign, lamenting that in preserving only the facades, the essence and character of the historic buildings have been lost. Ms. Kelly said: ""If you have a hammer and you replace the head and you replace the wooden shaft, is it still the same hammer that you had?"""
42267,"They Could Buy, but Why? Meet the High-Renters","For some New Yorkers with the wherewithal, renting is preferable to buying — even when their monthly payments are in the mid-five figures.","Timothy Brown, in his Kips Bay rental, has the wherewithal but not the will to buy an apartment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/realestate/21HIGHRENTERSCOV/21HIGHRENTERSCOV-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=ef02899a403c65255d0d78b4c98bea51a8eb48486d67f94ac3cda5d4c2a560f2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/realestate/they-can-afford-to-buy-but-they-would-rather-rent.html,9f7c0626-c615-5e9e-91b1-e925d4cadace.jpg,"Since moving to New York City 16 years ago, Timothy Brown has lived in seven rentals, a succession of studios and one-bedrooms in Brooklyn, Chelsea, Murray Hill and now Kips Bay, where he has been subletting in a postwar high-rise condo for the last three years. His real estate agent has been urging him in the strongest possible terms to buy a place, and Mr. Brown, 41, an interior designer, has the means to do so. The inclination? Not so much. ""My nature is to move every couple of years,"" he said. ""My broker has tried to convince me about the tax write-offs of ownership, but I have enough of those with my business."" Although Mr. Brown is renting (he pays $3,100 a month), he was permitted to renovate the kitchen and bathroom and thus put his stamp on the place -- just as if he owned it, something he has done in almost every apartment he has rented.

Buying an apartment in New York City is a marker of success for some residents. It says that they have accumulated an impressive pile of cash for a down payment (typically 20 percent, sometimes more) and that they have sufficient liquidity (and charm) to pass the scrutiny of a co-op or condo board. But plenty of people are like Mr. Brown, who have the wherewithal but not the will.

""Renting, for many people, is just a very convenient lifestyle move,"" said Gary Malin, the president of the real estate firm Citi Habitats. ""They may not be sure the city is right for them, or what part of the city they want to be in. If you make a mistake, once your year commitment is up, off you go."" Others, however enamored of the city, may not be certain about the length of their tenure. And the fees and taxes involved in buying ""are so high, it doesn't make sense unless you're going to be here for at least four or five years,"" said Kathy Braddock, a managing director at William Raveis New York. ""We are a city of renters. Most New Yorkers rent."" Indeed, rentals make up more than two-thirds of the housing stock in New York City, said Jonathan J. Miller, president and chief executive of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Ms. Braddock said: ""Here, there's no stigma attached to renting, which is not true elsewhere in the country.""

The financially savvy may prefer to invest in the market rather than tie up so much capital in a classic six. And it's not as if the well-heeled are giving up anything by refusing to buy. For those willing to pay for the privilege -- in some instances, the mid-five figures -- there are a number of new rental buildings with brand-name designers, kitchens with Sub-Zero refrigerators and Wolf stoves, a laundry list of amenities and hot-and-cold running staff.

""Back in the day, the great incentive to owning was that the product was better than a rental,"" said Stuart Moss, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group. ""But what happened was that many condos were built, and as a renter in those buildings you could get the high-end finishes. You no longer had to buy to get that quality and that more sophisticated design."" In response, developers of rental properties have raised their games. With buildings like 456 Washington in TriBeCa, where rents are $9,500 to $45,000 a month, and the Easton on Third Avenue and 92nd Street, ""we're providing a long-term rental alternative for people who can truly afford to live anywhere in the city,"" said Bryan Cho, an executive vice president of the Related Companies, who listed features in these buildings like custom millwork, marble bathrooms, elegant finishes and high-end appliances. ""We had a broker tell us, 'My clients have $9 million to spend on a co-op or condo, and they're getting frustrated because they can't find the home of their dreams,"" Mr. Cho said. ""'They're making compromises and feel embittered about it.' And then the client says: 'Why don't I keep my liquidity working for me? Why don't I buy a country place somewhere and why don't I just rent the best?'"" He also talked about a few couples who bought prewar apartments on Fifth and Park Avenues and who, during the subsequent renovations, rented at the Easton, where, depending on the size of the unit, they paid from about $5,000 to $22,000 a month. ""They love it so much that now they want to sell the co-op they bought and just stay at the Easton,"" he said. Uncertainty about the direction of their career or personal lives also keeps some people renting. Amanda Bradshaw is both admirably frugal and, after a succession of jobs, comfortable in her position as the director of human resources operations for an investment bank. She is at a point where she could buy -- but, first off, there is that frugality. Second, she lives in a one-bedroom on the second floor of a brownstone in Midtown East, ""and it's very me,"" she said. ""It has great moldings and hardwood floors and a big kitchen, and it's near SoulCycle.""

While Ms. Bradshaw doesn't want to keep shelling out money and not building up equity, (she said she is paying between $2,500 and $3,000 a month) and while she wants to own because it would be a declaration that she has entered a certifiably grown-up phase of life, she said: ""I'm 33 and I don't know what's to come in the next year or two. Also, I don't necessarily see myself as a lifetime city girl. Maybe I'll buy in the suburbs."" Stephen Ceurvorst wouldn't necessarily question the mental competence of those who choose to buy an apartment in New York City. Let's just say it's not for him. ""This is a generalization, but renting in Manhattan is substantially less expensive than owning,"" said Mr. Ceurvorst, 61, the founder and managing partner of a structured trade finance firm, who, since moving to New York in 1978, has lived all over the city -- freedom he savors -- and currently lives in a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in the Wall Street area. The building was built more than a century ago and has a nice feel as well as a very well-equipped gym, a billiards room, a theater and an attentive landlord. There is also plenty of space between his bedroom window and the window in the neighboring high-rise, ""so I don't have to put my shades down when I get out of bed,"" he said. For this, he said he pays $5,000 to $10,000 a month, ""and I could afford to pay double that."" ""There isn't much difference in lifestyle between owning and renting in Manhattan, except that if you pay rent you can spend more on the arts and sports and still have money left over,"" he continued. ""I prefer to rent and go to dinner anywhere I want. Why spend the extra money to buy, when in New York you sleep in your apartment but you live in the city?"""

Huck and Jim drifting south on the big river, Paul Bunyan hacking his way through the North Woods, Chuck Berry's Odyssean trek to the California ""promised land"" via bus and train and jumbo jet, Thelma and Louise's desperado ride to the edge of the Grand Canyon and beyond -- time and again, American literature, lore and pop culture have returned to tales of great migrations, last-chance power drives, epic schleps. The compulsion to head for the frontier has marked history on a grand scale, from the brutal wars of conquest that ""won the West"" to the ambitions of countless individuals who have hit the open American road to chase personal destinies.

But in the 21st century, have Americans lost their urge to roam? Tom Zoellner thinks so. ""Today our country is slowing down and staying in place -- an effect that Covid-19 only accelerated,"" Zoellner writes in ""The National Road: Dispatches From a Changing America."" ""A country on the move seems to be more reluctant than ever to pick up and go.""

Zoellner, the politics editor of The Los Angeles Review of Books and the author of several previous works of nonfiction -- including ""Train: Riding the Rails That Created the Modern World"" -- is an old-fashioned American vagabond. Over the past two decades, he has made some 30 cross-country drives and hundreds of ""lesser partial crossings,"" both as a journalist on assignment and as a tourist with a taste for obscure landmarks and truck-stop breakfasts. ""The National Road"" is a chronicle of Zoellner's wanderings and wanderlust, what he calls his ""unspecified hunger"" to cover the lower 48 states with ""a coat of invisible paint."" It's also a sneakily ambitious book whose 13 ""dispatches"" present a sweeping view of the American land and its inhabitants -- how each has shaped, and deformed, the other. ""How was it possible, I wondered, that all of this American land -- in every direction -- could be fastened together into a whole?"" Zoellner asks. ""What are the enduring features that make us Americans?""

Those are heady questions, and the answers Zoellner provides are often unnerving. Trump-era politics cast a chill over ""The National Road."" In a chapter about Los Angeles's Potter's Field, the burial ground for the city's unclaimed bodies, Zoellner describes the state of the nation as the coronavirus pandemic took hold last spring: ""Calvinism had been shorn of every restraining quality leaving only economic sociopathy; the good will that lubricated the Constitution had dehydrated into abrasive sand."" He visits the former Czech immigrant enclave of Spillville, Iowa, where Antonin Dvorak vacationed in the summer of 1893 and composed portions of the famous ""American"" Quartet. Today Spillville seethes with Trumpian nativism, yet its economy is dependent on Mexican migrants, who do the grunt work in the town's industrial pig farms."

57679,A Truck Tailgate Party: Fire Up the Grilles,"With trucks locked in ever-fiercer sales battles, their grilles have grown larger and more eye-catching, like modern, motorized battle shields.","BLUNT FORCE DRAMA The 2014 Chevrolet Silverado LTZ, one of latest crop of in-your-face pickup trucks.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/19/automobiles/Grills2/Grills2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=409&w=600&s=8381084817835bdca7f2e063c6a6efb3f67d2095663178467ef047e8b13111a0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/automobiles/tailgate-party-fire-up-the-grilles.html,dd12af87-4c86-5db5-a1f4-b3a8c48c623a.jpg,"The look of its pickup trucks is so important that General Motors put its best man on the job: the guy who does the Corvettes. Fresh from the task of designing the 2014 Stingray, Tom Peters took on the task of freshening up -- and toughening up -- the Chevrolet Silverado and its fraternal twin, the GMC Sierra. ""A fist in the wind"" is how Mr. Peters describes the pickups' design. The new G.M. trucks are not alone in looking as if they can deliver a punch. The latest full-size pickups from G.M.'s crosstown rivals, Ford and Ram, step into the ring with flattened noses, their huge, blunt grilles often slathered in bright trim. A special edition of the latest Toyota Tundra seems to have as many bars as Milwaukee, capped with a flat, wide nostril. ""There is a trend toward a bigger, bolder look,"" said Mr. Peters, the director of exterior design for Chevrolet trucks, full-size crossovers and performance cars. Automobile grilles have long been carefully created to reflect the image of their brands and a particular model's place in the hierarchy, while truck grilles were comparatively bare and basic. But with trucks locked in ever-fiercer sales battles, their grilles have grown larger and more eye-catching, a modern, motorized riff on the battle shields of medieval crusaders.

After taking a hit when the economy slumped, pickup sales are on the rise again on the strength of a rebounding construction industry: Ram (previously known as Dodge Trucks) gained 49 percent in April from a year earlier, and the full-size truck sales of G.M. and Ford each rose around 24 percent. Manufacturers are scrambling to grab larger shares of this highly profitable market with tougher, more distinctive designs. Rugged exteriors help to hide the fact that many of today's macho-looking trucks are softies on the inside, with interiors wrapped in soft leather, decked with wood trim and buzzing with electronic gadgets. Luxury trucks are especially hot. Ford says that about a third of its pickup sales come from the higher-end versions priced at $35,000 or more. Not long ago, a $50,000 pickup seemed unimaginable. Now the price tags on fancy trucks can rise well above $60,000. In addition, a tough grille can obscure the fact that the power plant behind it is shrinking -- with more fuel-efficient V-6 engines replacing thirsty V-8s in many pickup trucks.

In Texas, where one-sixth of the nation's pickups are sold, and where Mr. Peters showed off his new truck to the press recently, pickups are like the standard uniform of boots and cowboy hats: they are everywhere, but they come in many styles and shapes. Greater personalization, with a variety of available faces, is the latest truck trend. The image of the pickup truck is firmly wrapped in American mythology. Model names read like the listings for John Wayne Week on the Turner Classic Movies channel: High Country, King Ranch, Laramie Longhorn. Manufacturers present trucks primarily as work tools, but despite the ads featuring cowboys, farmers and construction workers, more and more trucks are being used partly -- or mostly -- as family vehicles. ""There's a lot of diversity in the customer range,"" said Joe Dehner, chief exterior designer for Ram and Dodge. In addition to working trucks, he said, ""we also get the 'air haulers,' which means they don't necessarily carry something."" For decades, trucks looked like basic metal boxes. Then Dodge offered up a bold new look for its Ram for the 1994 model year. Under Tom Gale, then the design chief for Chrysler, the pickup added a touch of fantasy to the utilitarian box. With its arched grille and raised hood, the Ram resembled the cab of a mighty 18-wheeler. Today's Ram designers call it ""the big-rig look,"" said Mr. Dehner. ""We own that."" But pickups from other manufacturers began to show the Ram's influence as their designers visually separated the hood and fenders and raised the grille above the headlights.

The perennial best-selling pickup, the Ford F-150, was last redesigned for 2009. But today's F-150 wears many faces: depending on the model or trim level, the grille has multiple small bars or large planks of chrome along with different shapes and colors of meshlike patterns. The Atlas concept truck, unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show, appears to borrow the muscular look of Ford's Super Duty line of larger, more powerful pickups. The Atlas is believed to foreshadow the design of the next-generation F-150, expected next year. The face of the Atlas adds vertical elements to the horizontal bars of the current F-150. The grille's frame forms a shape that suggests the nostrils of a bull. Toyota's new design for its big Tundra truck, first displayed at the Chicago auto show in February, was devised at the Calty design studio in California. The Tundra's grille frame has also been enlarged and its designers, too, use words like bold, chiseled and tough. In one sign of how much truck grilles have grown, the Nissan Titan's, which seemed notably aggressive when the truck made its debut as a 2004 model, looks relatively undersized in comparison with the newer designs of its rivals. Grilles play a critical role in differentiating the many submodels and trim levels of today's trucks. ""It is almost mind-boggling how complex the choices have become,"" Mr. Peters said.

Ford offers a huge choice of variants with its F-150, visually distinguishing a range from base models to King Ranch and Harley-Davidson editions, Special and Platinum luxury versions and the high-performance SVT Raptor, with huge letters molded into a black front end that Ford calls a ""brick wall grille."" Mr. Dehner, the Ram designer, said: ""There has been an explosion of different textures and finishes, not just in the grilles but with colors, wheels and trim packages. People want their vehicle to be customizable. It goes from the country to the urban cowboy and, if you will, the city slicker type. We want to be specific to their needs."" The Ram 1500 comes in nine trim levels and offers four basic types of grille mesh. There is a ""hex-link"" design on the Tradesman, Express and SLT models, with six-sided cells that provide ""the metaphor of the bolt head,"" Mr. Dehner said. The upscale Laramie has a similar ""hex-perf"" grille, in chrome. Then there are two versions of ""billet-perf"" on the Big Horn and Sport. ""It goes with a monochromatic look, big wheels, a hot-rod look,"" he said. The top-of-the-line Laramie Longhorn offers ""wave-mesh"" texture, a diamond wire pattern that dates to sports cars of the 1920s. ""It is an adaptation of the wire mesh grilles on upscale sport utilities,"" Mr. Dehner said. Aerodynamics, surprisingly, may be behind some of the rugged, angular faces of trucks. As boxy as they look, all the trucks are carefully tested in wind tunnels. The fist in the wind must be streamlined: Chevrolet says it has cut aerodynamic drag by 5 percent from the previous Silverado. ""Sometimes the design goes against what you assume is good for aero,"" said Gordon Platto of Ford, who directed the design of the Atlas concept truck. Crisp, clean lines on the sides and rear of a truck reduce drag. But in front, the Atlas has adjustable grille shutters, which close at higher speeds to reduce drag. The Ram trucks already have such a system, as do some passenger cars.

Ford engineers and designers have also devised a lower air dam for the Atlas as well as wheel-well shutters to direct air under the truck to reduce drag. For all their work, designers can be frustrated. The Ram designers are proud that they have increased their share of the market, but they also admit that they keep running up against the limits of design to entice new customers. Truck buyers are famously loyal to their brands. Many Ford owners would no sooner jump to Chevy or Ram than change their political parties or shift their football allegiance from the Oklahoma Sooners to the Texas Longhorns."

7287,"As Protests Spur Posts From Athletes, N.B.A. Players Take to the Streets",The season has been suspended. And the issue of police brutality toward African-Americans has long been a visceral one in a predominantly black league.,"Demonstrators protesting police brutality on Sunday outside Barclays Center, home of the Nets.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/01/sports/01unrest-athletes-1/01unrest-athletes-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=8c502df55c4ebe08f597623975cd598e83dda8dcf021e1b52c5411c1f5eee1af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/sports/basketball/george-floyd-nba-protests.html,061e7659-c31c-5c47-a272-a710ea5f3c73.jpg,"A broad range of athletes and sports figures have issued statements on social media condemning the killing of George Floyd and other police violence against African-Americans. But several N.B.A. players have gone even farther. They've jumped off the sidelines to join the sprawling protests that have leapt up all over the country, which lines up with an image the N.B.A. has gone to great lengths to cultivate for itself in recent years: that of a socially conscious league that has fought against injustice for decades stretching back to the days of Bill Russell. This comes with risk for the players: Some of the protests have turned violent, and many demonstrators are not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing in accordance with coronavirus pandemic precautions. Yet very few issues have sparked the outrage of figures in and around the N.B.A. like that of police brutality and the killing of black people, an issue that has touched many black communities in the United States and one that N.B.A. stars, who play in a predominantly black league, have been keen to speak on for several years.

Jaylen Brown, the 23-year-old rising star for the Celtics, said it took him 15 hours to drive from Boston to Atlanta to take part in protests. Brown, who went to high school in Georgia, invited others to join him over the weekend, posting a message on Twitter that said, ""Atlanta don't meet me there beat me there come walk with me bring your own signs."" He added in an Instagram story, ""First and foremost, I'm a black man and I'm a member of this community ... We're raising awareness for some of the injustices that we've been seeing."" Malcolm Brogdon, a 27-year-old guard for the Indiana Pacers, also demonstrated in Atlanta this weekend. ""I've got a grandfather that marched next to Dr. King in the '60s, and he was amazing,"" Brogdon said to a crowd through a bullhorn. ""He would be proud to see us all here.""

The league's activism has been selective, the N.B.A.'s critics note. It began the season in October with an international incident after a Houston Rockets executive expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, causing a protracted debate over whether league executives and players caved to China's anger over it. The N.B.A. also has a rule requiring that players stand during the national anthem, effectively banning them from kneeling, the very issue that has been a headache for the N.F.L. because of Colin Kaepernick. That dispute resurfaced after the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, issued a statement on Saturday that some players on social media found lacking self-awareness. But on the subject of the relationship between African-American communities and law enforcement, N.B.A. figures have been much more eager to weigh in and do more -- some even feeling a sense of profound obligation to express what they see as grievous injustice.

In response to Floyd's death, coaches and players have lined up to provide statements, as have teams, some in blunt terms. The Washington Wizards released a statement from its players that said -- in capital letters -- ""WE WILL NO LONGER TOLERATE THE ASSASSINATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY,"" adding, ""WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT THE ABUSE OF POWER FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT."" In a message to league employees on Sunday, Commissioner Adam Silver said, ""Racism, police brutality and racial injustice remain part of everyday life in America and cannot be ignored,"" adding, ""We will work hand-in-hand to create programs and build partnerships in every N.B.A. community that address racial inequity and bring people together."" These statements were notable because specific mentions of law enforcement were conspicuously missing from many corporate statements released last week. In a typical season, N.B.A. players would be able to express themselves at actual games, like in 2014, when many players wore ""I Can't Breathe"" T-shirts during warm-ups, a reference to Eric Garner, a black man who died in Staten Island after an officer used a chokehold. Or in 2012, when members of the Miami Heat posted pictures of the team wearing hoodies in response to the death of Trayvon Martin.

But N.B.A. teams are not together currently. The league is aiming to make a return to play in late July. In the meantime, many in the basketball community, like LeBron James, have responded by either spotlighting the protests or gone even further by joining them. The scale at which the deaths of Floyd, Breonna Taylor -- a black emergency room technician who was shot in her own apartment by the Louisville police following the execution of a ""no knock warrant"" in March -- and Ahmaud Arbery -- a 25-year-old black man who was pursued by armed white residents in February before being killed -- touched a nerve among players and some team executives was on display this weekend.

Much of the response has still been from a distance. Multiple N.B.A. coaches announced a committee to combat racism, and all the league's coaches issued a statement Monday condemning Floyd's killing, adding, that ""the reality is that African-Americans are targeted and victimized on a daily basis."" One of those coaches, Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs, a frequent critic of President Trump, gave a scathing interview to The Nation on Sunday, blasting Trump' and his response to the protests. ""We need a president to come out and say simply that 'Black Lives Matter.' Just say those three words. But he won't and he can't,"" Popovich said. ""He can't because it's more important to him to mollify the small group of followers who validate his insanity. But it's more than just Trump. The system has to change. I'll do whatever I can do to help because that's what leaders do."" The White House did not respond to a request for comment."

Playing Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders. Cooking pretend meals in a child-size kitchen. Dancing on the rug, building with blocks and painting on easels. Concerned that kindergarten has become overly academic in recent years, this suburban school district south of Baltimore is introducing a new curriculum in the fall for 5-year-olds. Chief among its features is a most old-fashioned concept: play. ""I feel like we have been driving the car in the wrong direction for a long time,"" said Carolyn Pillow, who has taught kindergarten for 15 years and attended a training session here on the new curriculum last month. ""We can't forget about the basics of what these kids need, which is movement and opportunities to play and explore."" As American classrooms have focused on raising test scores in math and reading, an outgrowth of the federal No Child Left Behind law and interpretations of the new Common Core standards, even the youngest students have been affected, with more formal lessons and less time in sandboxes. But these days, states like Vermont, Minnesota and Washington are again embracing play as a bedrock of kindergarten.

Like Anne Arundel County here, Washington and Minnesota are beginning to train teachers around the state on the importance of so-called purposeful play -- when teachers subtly guide children to learning goals through games, art and general fun. Vermont is rolling out new recommendations for kindergarten through third grade that underscore the importance of play. And North Carolina is encouraging teachers to evaluate paintings, scribbles or block-building sessions, instead of giving quizzes, in assessing the reading, math and social skills of kindergartners. But educators in low-income districts say a balance is critical. They warn that unlike students from affluent families, poorer children may not learn the basics of reading and math at home and may fall behind if play dominates so much that academics wither. ""Middle-class parents are doing this anyway, so if we don't do it for kids who are not getting it at home, then they are going to start at an even greater disadvantage,"" said Deborah Stipek, the dean of the Graduate School of Education at Stanford. Across the country, many schools in recent years have curtailed physical and art education in favor of longer blocks for reading and math instruction to help improve test scores. The harder work even began in kindergarten.

Most recently, more than 40 states have adopted the Common Core, standards for reading and math that in many cases are much more difficult than previous guidelines. In some school districts, 5-year-olds are doing what first or even second graders once did, and former kindergarten staples like dramatic play areas and water or sand tables have vanished from some classrooms, while worksheets and textbooks have appeared.

A study comparing federal government surveys of kindergarten teachers in 1998 and 2010 by researchers at the University of Virginia found that the proportion of teachers who said their students had daily art and music dropped drastically. Those who reported teaching spelling, the writing of complete sentences and basic math equations every day jumped. More on U.S. Schools and Education

While the pandemic has created an urgent search for teachers in some areas, not every district is suffering from shortages. Here are the factors in play The changes took place in classrooms with students of all demographic backgrounds, but the study found that schools with higher proportions of low-income students, as well as schools with large concentrations of nonwhite children, were even more likely to cut back on play, art and music while increasing the use of textbooks. Experts, though, never really supported the expulsion of playtime. Using play to develop academic knowledge -- as well as social skills -- in young children is the backbone of alternative educational philosophies like those of Maria Montessori or Reggio Emilia. And many veteran kindergarten teachers, as well as most academic researchers, say they have long known that children learn best when they are allowed ample time to go shopping at a pretend grocery store or figure out how to build bridges with wooden blocks. Even the Common Core standards state that play is a ""valuable activity."" But educators point out that children are also capable of absorbing sophisticated academic concepts. ""People think if you do one thing you can't do the other,"" said Nell Duke, a professor of education at the University of Michigan. ""It really is a false dichotomy."" M. Manuela Fonseca, the early-education coordinator for Vermont, said her state was trying to emphasize the learning value of play in its new guidelines.

""Before we had the water table because it was fun and kids liked it,"" she said. ""Now we have the water table so kids can explore how water moves and actually explore scientific ideas."" Still, teachers like Therese Iwancio, who works at Cecil Elementary School in Baltimore's Greenmount neighborhood, where the vast majority of children come from low-income families, say their students benefit from explicit academic instruction. She does not have a sand table, play kitchen or easel in the room.

Teachers were given tips on how to be more creative in academic lessons, too, like tossing a ball printed with different numbers to teach math. ""We don't think that rigor negates fun and play,"" said Patricia J. Saynuk, the coordinator of early-childhood education. Traci Burns, who has taught kindergarten for the last five years at Annapolis Elementary School, said she was looking forward to retrieving previously banished easels. ""With the Common Core, this has been pushed and pushed and pushed that kids should be reading, sitting and listening,"" she said. ""Five-year-olds need to play and color. They need to go out and sing songs."" At Hilltop Elementary, a racially and economically diverse school in Glen Burnie, Melissa Maenner said she had found that teaching kindergartners too many straightforward academic lessons tended to flop. ""They are 5,"" Ms. Maenner said. ""Their attention span is about five minutes."""

The strong results eased Wall Street's fears that consumers were pulling back from Apple's products, particularly its flagship, the iPhone. Apple said little about the upcoming phones and declined to address reports of production delays with a new high-end model, which is expected to feature an edge-to-edge screen and is expected to cost more than $1,000. The company's revenue projections for the quarter ending in September spanned a wide range, suggesting that executives are hedging on the exact timing of the iPhone update. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, addressed Apple's decision over the weekend to remove dozens of unlicensed virtual private networking apps that allowed Chinese consumers to access the entire internet and evade government censors.

""We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business,"" Mr. Cook said during a conference call with analysts to discuss the results. ""That doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way.""

""The law in the U.S. supported us,"" Mr. Cook said. ""It was very clear. In the case of China, the law is very clear there. Like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we have to abide by them in both cases."" For the quarter ending July 1, Apple reported revenue of $45.4 billion, up 7 percent from the same quarter last year. Net income was $8.7 billion, or $1.67 a share. Analysts had expected Apple to report revenue of $44.9 billion and net income of $8.2 billion, or $1.57 a share, according to estimates compiled by S&P Capital IQ. For the same quarter last year, Apple reported revenue of $42.36 billion and net income of $7.8 billion, or $1.42 a share.

The company's stock rose 6 percent in after-hours trading once the quarterly numbers were released. In an interview, Apple's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company saw increases in unit sales and revenue in every product category, including iPads, which had been struggling in recent quarters. Global sales of iPhones rose 2 percent to 41 million units. Revenue from services, which include app sales as well as iCloud storage and Apple Music, grew 22 percent, ahead of Apple's previous projections. Apple said revenue fell 10 percent in greater China, a key market where sales have dropped for six consecutive quarters. But Mr. Maestri said that sales in mainland China had stopped falling, with poor sales in Hong Kong dragging down the region's numbers. ""We feel we will do better in the September quarter,"" he said. The company is wrestling with increased competition in China from Samsung, as well as from Chinese companies making Android phones. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said Apple's business in China still faces big challenges. The rise of WeChat, a wildly popular Chinese chat app and social network, has made the underlying choice of phone less important to Chinese buyers. And many Android models sport cutting-edge features, yet cost less than an iPhone. ""The jury is still out on China,"" Mr. Sacconaghi said. Apple is also sensitive to the fact that its products are almost entirely made in China at a time when President Trump is pushing companies to increase American manufacturing jobs. Mr. Trump said last week that Mr. Cook had promised to build ""three big plants"" in the United States. Asked Tuesday about Mr. Trump's remarks, Mr. Cook deflected the question, saying that Apple had created two million jobs in America -- mostly developers who had written apps for the company's products and suppliers who made parts that went into Apple products. However, he added that Apple would have more news coming later this year about its direct employment in the United States. The company's Mac Pro computers are assembled in Texas, and the aging lineup is due for a revamp, offering Apple a chance to rethink its manufacturing."

In the 1880s he put up one of the most opulent of the Fifth Avenue-style mansions -- but he built it on Madison Avenue. It vanished a century ago, leaving only a monogram, but now the Marquand name is back.

By the early 1880s Madison Avenue near Central Park was lined by comfortable brownstone row houses, almost all developer-built, but top-notch. Although Fifth Avenue was the default address for millionaires, half a dozen chose to locate on Madison, perhaps with thrift rather than prestige in mind.

Marquand was one of these. He hired Richard Morris Hunt to give him a stocky, stolid mansion of red brick and limestone at the 68th Street corner. He also commissioned two separate but related houses facing Madison Avenue, apparently for family members. The entire assemblage had the scale of a French palace, albeit one with streetcar tracks in the front yard.

Marquand furnished his house sumptuously, with decorations by John La Farge, Samuel Colman and the English painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, who designed for him one of the most remarkable pianos in New York, finished in ebony, sandalwood, mother of pearl, ivory and coral. But after Marquand's death in 1902 the house sat empty. It was sold in 1912."

Cracks Down on 'Unscrupulous' Stem Cell Clinics,"The agency reported actions against a biotech company and two large stem cell clinics over unapproved treatments, a move it said was necessary to make way for speedier approval of legitimate therapies.","Dr. Mark Berman, of the Cell Surgical Network, in 2014 at his practice in Beverly Hills, Calif.

The agency reported actions against two large stem cell clinics and a biotech company, saying that it was critical to shut down ""unscrupulous actors"" in regenerative medicine, a broad umbrella that includes stem cell and gene therapies and immunotherapies. ""The F.D.A. will not allow deceitful actors to take advantage of vulnerable patients by purporting to have treatments or cures for serious diseases without any proof that they actually work,"" said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner. Stem cells, which can be extracted from bone marrow, blood or fat, can develop into many different types of cells, and are thought to have the potential to repair or replace tissue damaged by disease, injury or aging. But so far, the F.D.A. has approved only a few stem-cell products.

The companies that the F.D.A. cited have been performing liposuction to remove belly fat from patients, extracting stem cells and then injecting those cells back into the patients to treat various ailments. On Friday, the agency said, federal marshals seized 500 doses of live Vaccinia virus vaccine for smallpox belonging to StemImmune Inc., a San Diego firm that develops stem cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The raid came after the F.D.A. learned that the vaccine was being used to create an unapproved stem cell product, a combination of excess amounts of vaccine and stem cells derived from body fat, which was then administered to cancer patients with potentially compromised immune systems. The F.D.A. said patients at the California Stem Cell Treatment Centers in Rancho Mirage and Beverly Hills, Calif., received the treatment made with the smallpox vaccine. It also said it had serious concerns about how StemImmune obtained the vaccine for use in an unapproved and potentially dangerous treatment. StemImmune obtained at least some of the vaccine from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Thomas Skinner, a C.D.C. spokesman. In its request, the company said it was conducting cancer research involving the vaccinia virus, and needed to vaccinate researchers -- a seemingly legitimate reason. The company did not tell the C.D.C. that it was going to inject the vaccine into patients, he said. A statement from StemImmune said the company had lawfully obtained the drug. The F.D.A. also issued a warning letter to U.S. Stem Cell, a private clinic in Sunrise, Fla. The company was the subject of a March report in The New England Journal of Medicine, describing how one woman went blind and two others suffered severe, permanent eye damage after being given shots of stem cells, extracted from fat, into their eyes.

The warning letter accused the company of impairing the F.D.A.'s ability to conduct its inspection by refusing to allow inspectors in, and denying them access to employees. It also said that U.S. Stem Cell had failed to establish proper quality control and sanitary standards. In a statement Monday afternoon, U.S. Stem Cell denied ever restricting access to F.D.A. inspectors, or having sterility problems. ""The safety and health of our patients are our number one priority and the strict standards that we have in place follow the laws of the Food and Drug Administration,"" it said. Noting that the F.D.A. has asked patients with concerns to come forward, the company said it had asked patients who have had positive experiences with their stem cell treatments to notify the agency. But in the warning letter, the F.D.A. noted that U.S. Stem Cell had claimed its work was not subject to agency regulation. The F.D.A. disagreed, saying that the cells extracted by the company met the definition of both a drug and a biological product, both of which come under the agency's jurisdiction. In its statement, U.S. Stem Cell said it would abide by the new rules the agency is developing for the field. Dr. Gottlieb said it was imperative to shut down fraudulent and unsafe players in the field in order to take advantage of the promise of stem cell therapies and to increase innovation in the regenerative medicine field, a program authorized by Congress in the 21st Century Cures Act.

The California Stem Cell Treatment Centers were founded in 2010 by Dr. Mark Berman, a plastic surgeon, and Dr. Elliot Lander, a urologist. Dr. Berman defended the company, and said that the F.D.A. had not accurately interpreted its cancer pilot study with StemImmune. Dr. Berman, who is also a director of StemImmune, also said that none of the patients had experienced serious adverse effects or died as a result of the treatment involving the vaccine, which he noted, was free. Dr. Berman and Dr. Lander also train other physicians to perform liposuction, extract stem cells from the fat and inject the cells to treat many ailments, including heart disease, back and knee pain, asthma and neurological disorders. After training, the physicians can become affiliates of the Cell Surgical Network, which has more than 60 members around the country. Patients are charged $8,900 per procedure, Dr. Berman said in a previous interview. He said affiliates purchase a centrifuge and incubator from the network for about $29,000, and pay the network $1,000 for the disposable liposuction equipment needed for each procedure. A Florida woman, Doris Tyler, 77, lost her sight after being treated last September at an affiliate of the Cell Surgical Network, the Ageless Wellness Center in Peachtree City, Ga. Cells from her fat were injected into both eyes. Before the treatment, Mrs. Tyler's sight had deteriorated because of age-related macular degeneration. But she said she could still see well enough to get around, cook and read. Within a month of the injections, Mrs. Tyler had a retinal detachment and lost the sight in her left eye. A few weeks later, the same thing happened to her right eye. She consulted Dr. Thomas Albini, an eye surgeon at the Bascom-Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami, who had also examined the three women who went blind after similar treatment at the U.S. Stem Cell Clinic.

In an interview, Dr. Albini said Mrs. Tyler's case resembled the others. The stem cells apparently formed a membrane that pulled the retina off the back of the eye, causing blindness. Attempts to reattach the retinas surgically could not restore Mrs. Tyler's sight. She was permanently blinded. Calls to the clinic in Peachtree City were not returned. Dr. Berman said that because of her case, affiliates of the Cell Surgical Network were being advised to avoid giving injections directly into the eyes. ""We made a bad decision to have this done,"" Mrs. Tyler's husband said. Dr. Gottlieb said the F.D.A. would soon publish documents detailing which new treatments and products are subject to agency regulation, and which are not, and giving details on a new, expedited path for companies with legitimate products, seeking premarket approval. ""The F.D.A.'s proposal is clear evidence of the fact that the regenerative medicine sector has matured and has moved from just a research sector to a development of market ready products,"" said Michael Werner, a partner in the law firm of Holland & Knight and the executive director of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine. ""He's clearly distinguishing unscrupulous actors who are playing upon hype and taking advantage of patients and product developers who are actually going to treat diseases."" 'He is trying to balance patient safety and a regulatory pathway that is as least burdensome as possible,"" Mr. Werner said. Public health advocates praised the F.D.A. for moving against the companies, but said it should have happened sooner, given the widespread knowledge of public harm. ""We certainly welcome this type of action, although it comes belatedly,"" said Dr. Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group. ""The agency has known about these unscrupulous actors for years."""

Now, in the midst of a pandemic, we see exactly what that means. The economy is shattered. Unemployment continues to climb, steeply. There is no coherent federal leadership. The president mocks any attempts at modeling precautionary behaviors that might save American lives. More than 100,000 Americans have died from Covid-19. Many of us have been in some form of self-isolation for more than two months. The less fortunate continue to risk their lives because they cannot afford to shelter from the virus. People who were already living on the margins are dealing with financial stresses that the government's $1,200 ""stimulus"" payment cannot begin to relieve. A housing crisis is imminent. Many parts of the country are reopening prematurely. Protesters have stormed state capitals, demanding that businesses reopen. The country is starkly dividing between those who believe in science and those who don't.

Commercials celebrate essential workers and medical professionals. Commercials show how corporations have adapted to ""the way we live now,"" with curbside pickup and drive-through service and contact-free delivery. We can spend our way to normalcy, and capitalism will hold us close, these ads would have us believe. Some people are trying to provide the salvation the government will not. There are community-led initiatives for everything from grocery deliveries for the elderly and immunocompromised to sewing face masks for essential workers. There are online pleas for fund-raising. Buy from your independent bookstore. Get takeout or delivery from your favorite restaurant. Keep your favorite bookstore open. Buy gift cards. Pay the people who work for you, even if they can't come to work. Do as much as you can, and then do more. These are all lovely ideas and they demonstrate good intentions, but we can only do so much. The disparities that normally fracture our culture are becoming even more pronounced as we decide, collectively, what we choose to save -- what deserves to be saved. And even during a pandemic, racism is as pernicious as ever. Covid-19 is disproportionately affecting the black community, but we can hardly take the time to sit with that horror as we are reminded, every single day, that there is no context in which black lives matter.

Breonna Taylor was killed in her Louisville, Ky., home by police officers looking for a man who did not even live in her building. She was 26 years old. When demonstrations erupted, seven people were shot. Ahmaud Arbery was jogging in South Georgia when he was chased down by two armed white men who suspected him of robbery and claimed they were trying perform a citizen's arrest. One shot and killed Mr. Arbery while a third person videotaped the encounter. No charges were filed until the video was leaked and public outrage demanded action. Mr. Arbery was 25 years old. In Minneapolis, George Floyd was held to the ground by a police officer kneeling on his neck during an arrest. He begged for the officer to stop torturing him. Like Eric Garner, he said he couldn't breathe. Three other police officers watched and did not intervene. Mr. Floyd was 46 years old. These black lives mattered. These black people were loved. Their losses to their friends, family, and communities, are incalculable. Demonstrators in Minneapolis took to the street for several days, to protest the killing of Mr. Floyd. Mr. Trump -- who in 2017 told police officers to be rough on people during arrests, imploring them to ""please, don't be too nice"" -- wrote in a tweet, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The official White House Twitter feed reposted the president's comments. There is no rock bottom. Christian Cooper, an avid birder, was in Central Park's Ramble when he asked a white woman, Amy Cooper, to comply with the law and leash her dog. He began filming, which only enraged Ms. Cooper further. She pulled out her phone and said she was going to call the police to tell them an African-American man was threatening her.

She called the police. She knew what she was doing. She weaponized her whiteness and fragility like so many white women before her. She began to sound more and more hysterical, even though she had to have known she was potentially sentencing a black man to death for expecting her to follow rules she did not think applied to her. It is a stroke of luck that Mr. Cooper did not become another unbearable statistic. An unfortunate percentage of my cultural criticism over the past 11 or 12 years has focused on the senseless loss of black life. Mike Brown. Trayvon Martin. Sandra Bland. Philando Castile. Tamir Rice. Jordan Davis. Atatiana Jefferson. The Charleston Nine. These names are the worst kind of refrain, an inescapable burden. These names are hashtags, elegies, battle cries. Still nothing changes. Racism is litigated over and over again when another video depicting another atrocity comes to light. Black people share the truth of their lives, and white people treat those truths as intellectual exercises. They put energy into being outraged about the name ""Karen,"" as shorthand for entitled white women rather than doing the difficult, self-reflective work of examining their own prejudices. They speculate about what murdered black people might have done that we don't know about to beget their fates, as if alleged crimes are punishable by death without a trial by jury. They demand perfection as the price for black existence while harboring no such standards for anyone else. Some white people act as if there are two sides to racism, as if racists are people we need to reason with. They fret over the destruction of property and want everyone to just get along. They struggle to understand why black people are rioting but offer no alternatives about what a people should do about a lifetime of rage, disempowerment and injustice. When I warned in 2018 that no one was coming to save us, I wrote that I was tired of comfortable lies. I'm even more exhausted now. Like many black people, I am furious and fed up, but that doesn't matter at all. I write similar things about different black lives lost over and over and over. I tell myself I am done with this subject. Then something so horrific happens that I know I must say something, even though I know that the people who truly need to be moved are immovable. They don't care about black lives. They don't care about anyone's lives. They won't even wear masks to mitigate a virus for which there is no cure. Eventually, doctors will find a coronavirus vaccine, but black people will continue to wait, despite the futility of hope, for a cure for racism. We will live with the knowledge that a hashtag is not a vaccine for white supremacy. We live with the knowledge that, still, no one is coming to save us. The rest of the world yearns to get back to normal. For black people, normal is the very thing from which we yearn to be free.

13598,Michelle Obama's 'Becoming' Editor Starts Her Own Publishing Firm,"Molly Stern, the former publisher of Crown, is starting Zando, an independent publishing company with an unusual marketing strategy.","&ldquo;What I really wanted to do was tend to my own obsessions and figure out how to do it independently,&rdquo; Molly Stern said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/23/books/23zando-print1/00MollyStern-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=90047ca8553b6b11f6649fed2217de61b6ce05a47637b1791ef16b618ba01a8b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/books/zando-molly-stern-publishing.html,f67ebd6f-4833-513b-a9b4-bdb1d35f7c84.jpg,"""What I really wanted to do was tend to my own obsessions and figure out how to do it independently,"" Molly Stern said.





Two years ago, at what seemed to be the pinnacle of her 25 years in publishing, Molly Stern's career came to an abrupt halt. As publisher of Crown, Ms. Stern had released 2018's biggest blockbuster -- Michelle Obama's memoir, ""Becoming,"" which sold more than two million copies in its first two weeks. Less than a month later, Ms. Stern left the company in a shake-up, after Penguin Random House merged the Crown and Random House publishing divisions. Her departure baffled many in the industry because of Ms. Stern's track record for spotting both commercial and literary hits. A natural next move would have been to set up shop with her own imprint at a rival publishing house, but as she surveyed the landscape, she decided she wanted to build something from scratch. ""What I really wanted to do was tend to my own obsessions and figure out how to do it independently,"" she said in an interview this week. ""The opportunity to do something new was just too exciting.""

Ms. Stern is starting a new publishing company, Zando, with an unusual marketing and publicity model. Rather than relying chiefly on bookstores, retailers, advertising and other traditional channels to promote authors, she plans to team up with high-profile individuals, companies and brands, who will act as publishing partners and promote books to their fans and customers. Zando is in advanced negotiations with several potential partners, Ms. Stern said, though the company was not prepared to name them or announce projects. Zando's partners will get a cut of the royalties; Ms. Stern declined to provide specific breakdowns. Launching a new publishing venture in an oversaturated media ecosystem -- not to mention during a pandemic and economic crisis -- may seem like a risky undertaking. But Ms. Stern has aligned herself with deep-pocketed backers. This summer, she received a significant start-up investment from Sister, an independent global studio that was founded in 2019 by the media executive Elisabeth Murdoch, the film industry executive Stacey Snider and the producer Jane Featherstone. Ms. Stern, Ms. Murdoch and Ms. Snider will sit on Zando's board of directors, along with Matthew Lieber, co-founder of the podcasting company Gimlet, and David Benioff, one of the producers of ""Game of Thrones."" Ms. Murdoch said in an interview that she wanted to invest in Ms. Stern's publishing company because it aligned with Sister's goal of producing high-quality entertainment from emerging writers. The team behind Sister produced the HBO series ""Chernobyl"" and the British thriller ""Broadchurch.""

""When you have a world of massive consolidation and homogeneity, Molly and Sister have a huge passion for new voices,"" Ms. Murdoch, the daughter of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, said. With her industry experience, Ms. Stern may also have an advantage when it comes to signing authors. During her tenure at Crown, the company published blockbusters like Ernest Cline's ""Ready Player One,"" Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl"" and Andy Weir's ""The Martian,"" as well as breakout works of translation like Han Kang's ""The Vegetarian,"" which won the Booker International Prize. At Crown, Ms. Stern helped the actress Sarah Jessica Parker start her own literary fiction imprint, an experience she drew on in creating the business model for Zando. ""That's an advantage she has from being in the business for as long as she has,"" said the literary agent David Kuhn. ""There will be authors who have worked with Molly in the past who will be much more open to trying something different."" By aligning authors with cultural ambassadors of sorts, Zando aims to deploy star power to keep its books from drowning in a sea of online content. ""Discoverability is a real crisis,"" Ms. Stern said. At Crown, when she was publishing books by lesser-known authors, the lack of broad support was constantly frustrating, even when authors got positive reviews and retail promotion. ""You felt that you were publishing into a vacuum,"" she said. ""To find an audience is increasingly complicated."" Several celebrities and public figures, including Jenna Bush Hager, Emma Watson and Reese Witherspoon, have started book clubs and emerged as literary influencers. Ms. Witherspoon's endorsements helped turn novels like ""Little Fires Everywhere"" and ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" into hits, and she has made her media company, Hello Sunshine, into a book-to-screen factory."

Send it to a friend and tell them to sign up at nytimes.com/rory. In Neil Postman's eyes, the problem was encapsulated by just two words: ""Now This."" That phrase was the whole phenomenon. Those of you in the United States will certainly have heard it; in Britain, too, though here it often goes unsaid: It is a shift in the seat, a switch of camera angles, a change in tone. Either way, it is a staple of news broadcasts. It is the moment that an anchor flicks between gears, gliding apparently effortlessly from the serious business of news -- wars and tragedy and misery and corruption -- into something entirely unrelated and, more often than not, lighthearted or even uplifting: the ephemera of royalty or celebrity or kittens stuck in trees. In his seminal 1985 book, ""Amusing Ourselves to Death,"" Postman argued that ""Now This"" was far more pernicious than it might have appeared (or been intended to be). It was proof, he wrote, that television news had lost sight of the boundary between information and entertainment, that it had prioritized giving people what they wanted to see ahead of telling them what they needed to know.

The jarring disconnect -- the sudden change in tone -- was just as powerful. By switching so quickly, in just two pithy words, news programs blurred the lines between what was important and what was not. By juxtaposing the serious with the frivolous -- and often affording each equal airtime -- they stripped the former of their significance. The written media does this, too, of course, whether it is on paper or on a screen, hoping that if it cannot catch your eye with a chronicle of events, then it might tempt you with a recipe or a movie review or some nonsense about a soccer match. Sometimes those sections have clearly defined edges. Sometimes they blend into one another, and the boundaries between important and not important start to fade. I have been thinking a lot about Postman's work in the context of the proposed takeover of Newcastle United by a consortium largely financed by the Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The deal, worth around $370 million, is expected to be ratified in the next couple of weeks; the Premier League has not yet officially approved it. It has, of course, attracted no shortage of controversy: Amnesty International, which has labeled Saudi Arabia the ""kingdom of cruelty,"" has written to the Premier League warning that allowing the takeover to proceed risked making the league a ""patsy of those who want to use the glamour and prestige of Premier League football to cover up actions that are deeply immoral."" The Premier League responded, moderately brusquely, to that assertion. It will be far harder to shake off a complaint from BeIN, the broadcaster based in Qatar that serves as the Premier League's partner in the Gulf, that Saudi Arabia should not be permitted to invest in a league that it has spent a considerable amount of time undermining through a pirate broadcasting network.

That, you would have thought, would be enough if not to give the Premier League pause, then certainly to dampen the desire of Newcastle's fans to see the deal get through. When you are a child, you dream of your team scoring goals and winning trophies and achieving greatness. You do not dream of it being drawn against its will and for unidentified purposes into a simmering geopolitical conflict between sovereign states. It is hard to gauge proportions precisely, but it is fair to say at least a portion of Newcastle's fan base has few, if any, qualms whatsoever. There are myriad reasons for that, before we get to the futile whataboutery that tends to clog social media on subjects like this. Prime among them is an overwhelming, long held and understandable desire to get rid of Newcastle's current owner, the tracksuit tycoon Mike Ashley, who has shown precious little regard for the history of the club and the hopes of its fans.

Then there is -- again, understandable -- the belief that it is not for fans to stand up and protest at Saudi investment in soccer when the British government does deals with the country, when Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia's ally in the war in Yemen, owns Manchester City. If the Premier League is happy enough for Mohammed bin Salman to come and join the party, why should there be a higher moral burden on Newcastle fans than there is on these institutions? But I wonder, too, if there is a further explanation, one Postman might recognize, one to do with how we talk about failure and disappointment in sports, with our failure to separate properly the serious and (at heart) the frivolous. The language we use for soccer is, after all, the same as the language we use for the rest of the news, for governments falling and politicians failing and, at times, tragedies occurring. A poor run of form or a disappointing season is a disaster. A manager or a player underperforming is an outrage. An inept or ill-advised owner is a disgrace.

And in the middle of it all are the fans, who are heartbroken or dejected or weary or in some way suffering, victims of a litany of injustices. That is how it feels, of course, to all of us, at times, but it is here that language lets us down, where the equal use of the same terms in distinct contexts -- the serious business of war and tragedy, and the frivolous business of sport -- is problematic. Not all victims are equal. Not all suffering is the same. Not all stories are of the same importance. But after a while -- for everyone, not just for Newcastle fans -- the language blurs that line, erases that boundary, and so sporting disappointment seems to have the same significance as governmental incompetence. The Now This seems to become as important as the lead item. And in that context, morality becomes much more flexible, and you are prepared to make sacrifices and accommodations and pacts with whoever rides to your rescue, so long as they can alleviate the pain, ease the disappointment, end the suffering. You need to be saved, after all -- and you deserve to be saved -- and it becomes easier to tolerate the idea of anyone, anyone at all, as your savior. What appears black and white drifts into gray. Morals, after all, are only for those who can afford the privilege. What, in other circumstances, has been serious, now scarcely seems to matter at all, in a world in which the lines are blurred, the edges smooth and everything is treated the same. Be Careful What You Whisper

And if the situation in any given country means neither of those options is safe -- which remains entirely possible -- then it wants some sort of result to the season: a method of determining who finished where, such as allocating teams points on the basis of how many points teams have been picking up per game. This is all eminently sensible (UEFA has been a surprising bastion of common sense and patience throughout the pandemic), but what -- in England, at least -- was most significant was what was not mentioned. UEFA does not seem to think that voiding the season -- annulling it entirely, pretending it didn't happen, starting it from scratch -- is an option. Which is odd, because the conversation in England has been dominated by that prospect, one that should always have been an option of absolute last resort. That is, in no small part, down to a handful of club executives, almost always anonymous, who have spent much of the last month telling journalists it was not just a possibility but a moral imperative. The line has been repeated, ad nauseam, every week or so, to the extent that it has come to be a central plank of the discussion, even as it became increasingly clear that it was distinctly unlikely. That plan was always fraught with risk, and UEFA has essentially called it out. If those same executives genuinely -- as they might -- believe it is unfathomable to play soccer again for many months, then they must advocate a points-per-game system. Which just might, as it happens, cost their club rather more money than annulling would have done.

And I'm inclined to think Patrick Tarbox poses an excellent question. ""A lot of the appeal of football to me is the environment and the passion around it,"" he wrote. ""How quickly does that appeal of 'anything live' go away and we as consumers of football get bored or don't like the 'new normal?'"" That's all for this week.

While Mr. Greenspan is in charge of the laundry, both appreciate having a washer-dryer in their new three-bedroom apartment.



With Baby on the Way, Laundry Comes First

When Ashley and Andrew Greenspan found out their first child would arrive in June, upsizing was in the offing. The couple had been renting a one-bedroom in Leonard Pointe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. They planned to make the leap to a three-bedroom elsewhere -- Leonard Pointe doesn't have any -- with the extra bedroom reserved for a live-in au pair. ""I was kind of excited at how many options there were, and at the prospect of finding something quickly,"" said Ms. Greenspan, 29, who works in marketing. ""I wanted to be settled well in advance.""

The priority for Mr. Greenspan, 37, who works in the field of corporate sustainability, was a washer-dryer -- largely because he is in charge of the family's laundry. He had had his own washer and dryer when he lived in Chelsea, and he knew a baby would mean endless laundry. ""When we have the baby, we are going to be throwing in the bombed-out onesies, and it is going to be a constant cycle,"" he said.

Rents for three-bedrooms there were around $4,000. But the unit they saw had few closets, and adding more would have consumed precious bedroom space. And the balcony faced the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, with its noise and exhaust. ""It wasn't a place you wanted to go out and enjoy your morning coffee,"" Mr. Greenspan said. They rarely used the balcony they had, which faced the same highway.

They were ready for an older and less transient neighborhood, too. ""As much as the youthfulness of Williamsburg contributes to its vibe, the people weren't really friendly,"" Ms. Greenspan said. In their building, people didn't talk in the elevator, which they found awkward. Ms. Greenspan grew up in Harlem, where ""everyone talks to everyone, and you feel like you are family,"" she said. Concerned about the looming shutdown of the L train for repairs, the Greenspans cast their eyes toward Long Island City, Queens, where they liked the transit options as well as green spaces like the Gantry Plaza State Park.

Jackson Park, a huge new rental complex that opened in January, is known for its mega-amenities, including two swimming pools, a private park and courts for sports like basketball, squash and shuffleboard. But the complex, which has nearly 1,900 units, was so big that the Greenspans worried the atmosphere would be impersonal and hotel-like. Three-bedrooms, which currently rent in the $5,000s, were over their budget, and it seemed unwise to pay extra for so many amenities they might never use. (The amenity-fee structure is not yet finalized, a building spokeswoman said.) At a new 56-unit condo building, the Jackson -- recently built on the site of a former parking area -- they found their home. The apartment faced a courtyard, a refreshing change from a busy street view.

They miss Williamsburg's many retail offerings. ""We are trying to figure out what our spots will be,"" Ms. Greenspan said. ""We don't have our 'Cheers' bar yet."" In their building, still so new it is not fully occupied, the neighbors are older than in their previous place, and many have small children. ""We were right in predicting that the culture would be closer to what we were looking for,"" Ms. Greenspan said. ""In the gym, everyone says hello, and there are full-blown conversations."" One drawback is busy Jackson Avenue out front, but there won't be much reason to cross with the baby; they will head the other way, toward the waterfront. And they find the high-tech intercom system frustrating, as it calls a person's cellphone rather than ringing in the apartment. But by happy coincidence, they are across from MoMA P.S. 1, the museum where they met at a music festival six years ago. ""As cheesy as it sounds,"" Mr. Greenspan said, ""it's fun to come full circle and have a baby across from where we met."""
39037,Obama's Secret to Surviving the White House Years: Books,"In an interview seven days before leaving office, Mr. Obama talked about the role books have played during his presidency and throughout his life.",President Obama in the Oval Office during an interview with Michiko Kakutani on Friday.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/16/us/16OBAMA-BOOKS-01/16OBAMA-BOOKS-01-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e246ffde806820cf0ec445839ea4d3378382c1d4182832366d867dfcb9a41ab3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/books/obamas-secret-to-surviving-the-white-house-years-books.html,849a74a0-0876-5186-ab08-3adce2544b31.jpg,"Not since Lincoln has there been a president as fundamentally shaped -- in his life, convictions and outlook on the world -- by reading and writing as Barack Obama. Last Friday, seven days before his departure from the White House, Mr. Obama sat down in the Oval Office and talked about the indispensable role that books have played during his presidency and throughout his life -- from his peripatetic and sometimes lonely boyhood, when ""these worlds that were portable"" provided companionship, to his youth when they helped him to figure out who he was, what he thought and what was important. During his eight years in the White House -- in a noisy era of information overload, extreme partisanship and knee-jerk reactions -- books were a sustaining source of ideas and inspiration, and gave him a renewed appreciation for the complexities and ambiguities of the human condition. ""At a time when events move so quickly and so much information is transmitted,"" he said, reading gave him the ability to occasionally ""slow down and get perspective"" and ""the ability to get in somebody else's shoes."" These two things, he added, ""have been invaluable to me. Whether they've made me a better president I can't say. But what I can say is that they have allowed me to sort of maintain my balance during the course of eight years, because this is a place that comes at you hard and fast and doesn't let up.""

Like Lincoln, Mr. Obama taught himself how to write, and for him, too, words became a way to define himself, and to communicate his ideas and ideals to the world. In fact, there is a clear, shining line connecting Lincoln and King, and President Obama. In speeches like the ones delivered in Charleston and Selma, he has followed in their footsteps, putting his mastery of language in the service of a sweeping historical vision, which, like theirs, situates our current struggles with race and injustice in a historical continuum that traces how far we've come and how far we have yet to go. It's a vision of America as an unfinished project -- a continuing, more-than-two-century journey to make the promises of the Declaration of Independence real for everyone -- rooted both in Scripture and the possibility of redemption, and a more existential belief that we can continually remake ourselves. And it's a vision shared by the civil rights movement, which overcame obstacle after obstacle, and persevered in the face of daunting odds. Mr. Obama's long view of history and the optimism (combined with a stirring reminder of the hard work required by democracy) that he articulated in his farewell speech last week are part of a hard-won faith, grounded in his reading, in his knowledge of history (and its unexpected zigs and zags), and his embrace of artists like Shakespeare who saw the human situation entire: its follies, cruelties and mad blunders, but also its resilience, decencies and acts of grace. The playwright's tragedies, he says, have been ""foundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings."" Presidential biographies also provided context, countering the tendency to think ""that whatever's going on right now is uniquely disastrous or amazing or difficult,"" he said. ""It just serves you well to think about Roosevelt trying to navigate through World War II.""

Even books initially picked up as escape reading like the Hugo Award-winning apocalyptic sci-fi epic ""The Three-Body Problem"" by the Chinese writer Liu Cixin, he said, could unexpectedly put things in perspective: ""The scope of it was immense. So that was fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty -- not something to worry about. Aliens are about to invade!"" In his searching 1995 book ""Dreams From My Father,"" Mr. Obama recalls how reading was a crucial tool in sorting out what he believed, dating back to his teenage years, when he immersed himself in works by Baldwin, Ellison, Hughes, Wright, DuBois and Malcolm X in an effort ""to raise myself to be a black man in America."" Later, during his last two years in college, he spent a focused period of deep self-reflection and study, methodically reading philosophers from St. Augustine to Nietzsche, Emerson to Sartre to Niebuhr, to strip down and test his own beliefs. To this day, reading has remained an essential part of his daily life. He recently gave his daughter Malia a Kindle filled with books he wanted to share with her (including ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" ""The Golden Notebook"" and ""The Woman Warrior""). And most every night in the White House, he would read for an hour or so late at night -- reading that was deep and ecumenical, ranging from contemporary literary fiction (the last novel he read was Colson Whitehead's ""The Underground Railroad"") to classic novels to groundbreaking works of nonfiction like Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" and Elizabeth Kolbert's ""The Sixth Extinction."" Such books were a way for the president to shift mental gears from the briefs and policy papers he studied during the day, a way ""to get out of my own head,"" a way to escape the White House bubble. Some novels helped him to better ""imagine what's going on in the lives of people"" across the country -- for instance, he found that Marilynne Robinson's novels connected him emotionally to the people he was meeting in Iowa during the 2008 campaign, and to his own grandparents, who were from the Midwest, and the small town values of hard work and honesty and humility. Other novels served as a kind of foil -- something to argue with. V. S. Naipaul's novel ""A Bend in the River,"" Mr. Obama recalls, ""starts with the line 'The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.' And I always think about that line and I think about his novels when I'm thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes, particularly in foreign policy, and I resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical, more realistic view of the world. And yet, there are times where it feels as if that may be true."" Writing was key to his thinking process, too: a tool for sorting through ""a lot of crosscurrents in my own life -- race, class, family. And I genuinely believe that it was part of the way in which I was able to integrate all these pieces of myself into something relatively whole.""

Mr. Obama taught himself to write as a young man by keeping a journal and writing short stories when he was a community organizer in Chicago -- working on them after he came home from work and drawing upon the stories of the people he met. Many of the tales were about older people, and were informed by a sense of disappointment and loss: ""There is not a lot of Jack Kerouac open-road, young kid on the make discovering stuff,"" he says. ""It's more melancholy and reflective."" That experience underscored the power of empathy. An outsider himself -- with a father from Kenya, who left when he was 2, and a mother from Kansas, who took him to live for a time in Indonesia -- he could relate to many of the people he met in the churches and streets of Chicago, who felt dislocated by change and isolation, and he took to heart his boss's observation that ""the thing that brings people together to share the courage to take action on behalf of their lives is not just that they care about the same issues, it's that they have shared stories."" This lesson would become a cornerstone of the president's vision of an America where shared concerns -- simple dreams of a decent job, a secure future for one's children -- might bridge differences and divisions. After all, many people saw their own stories in his -- an American story, as he said in his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention possible ""in no other country on Earth.""

In today's polarized environment, where the internet has let people increasingly retreat to their own silos (talking only to like-minded folks, who amplify their certainties and biases), the president sees novels and other art (like the musical ""Hamilton"") as providing a kind of bridge that might span usual divides and ""a reminder of the truths under the surface of what we argue about every day."" He points out, for instance, that the fiction of Junot Diaz and Jhumpa Lahiri speaks ""to a very particular contemporary immigration experience,"" but at the same time tell stories about ""longing for this better place but also feeling displaced"" -- a theme central to much of American literature, and not unlike books by Philip Roth and Saul Bellow that are ""steeped with this sense of being an outsider, longing to get in, not sure what you're giving up."" Mr. Obama entered office as a writer, and he will soon return to a private life as a writer, planning to work on his memoirs, which will draw on journals he's kept in the White House (""but not with the sort of discipline that I would have hoped for""). He has a writer's sensibility -- an ability to be in the moment while standing apart as an observer, a novelist's eye and ear for detail, and a precise but elastic voice capable of moving easily between the lyrical and the vernacular and the profound."
13025,'Staggeringly High': U.S. Jobless Claims Remained Elevated Last Week,"More than 800,000 Americans filed new applications for state unemployment benefits.","An empty retail space on Madison Avenue in New York. Economists warn that without more aid, layoffs will rise again.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/10/business/08markets-brf-jobless/10markets-brf-jobless1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=45a33d5054706f3f78b0ba6a4f9e74d7c61454237d3411b6eb56f87e3d1e2d30&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/economy/unemployment-jobless-claims-coronavirus.html,345d7ba7-6dc1-5d86-b1c9-d897cdf42d3c.jpg,"Applications for jobless benefits remained high last week, even as the collapse of stimulus talks in Washington raised fears of a new wave of layoffs. Unemployment filings have fallen swiftly from their peak of more than six million last spring. But that progress has recently stalled at a level far higher than the worst weeks of past recessions. That pattern continued last week, the Labor Department said Thursday: More than 800,000 Americans filed new applications for state benefits, before adjusting for seasonal variations, roughly in line with where the total has been since early August. ""The level of claims is still staggeringly high,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at the career site Glassdoor. ""We're seeing evidence that the recovery is slowing down, whether it's in slowing payroll gains or in the sluggish improvement in jobless claims."" That slowdown comes as trillions of dollars in government aid to households and businesses has dried up. Prospects for a new stimulus package, already dubious in a divided Washington, appeared to fall apart this week when President Trump said he was pulling out of negotiations. Economists across the ideological spectrum warn that the loss of federal help will lead to more layoffs and business failures, and more pain for families.

The continued high level of jobless claims, combined with large monthly job gains, highlights the remarkable level of churn still roiling the U.S. labor market. Companies are continuing to rehire workers as they reopen, even as other companies cut jobs in response to still-depressed demand for goods and services. The result is a job market that is being pulled in two directions at once -- and economic data that can appear to tell contradictory stories.

In California's Inland Empire, As warehouse construction balloons nationwide, residents in communities both rural and urban have pushed back. In California's Inland Empire, the anger has turned to widespread action Adding to the challenge for analysts and forecasters, the pandemic has thrown the data itself into disarray. For the second week in a row, the jobless claims data carried a Golden-State-size asterisk: California last month announced that it would temporarily stop accepting new unemployment applications while it addressed a huge processing backlog and installed procedures to weed out fraud. In the absence of up-to-date data, the Labor Department is assuming California's claim number was unchanged from its pre-shutdown figure of more than 225,000 applications, or more than a quarter of the national total. The state began accepting new filings this week, and is expected to resume reporting data in time for next week's report. While the lack of data from California makes week-to-week comparisons difficult, the bigger picture is clear: The economic recovery is losing momentum, even as millions of Americans remain out of work. Monthly jobs data released last week showed that job growth slowed sharply in September, and that last spring's temporary furloughs are increasingly turning into permanent job losses. Major corporations like Disney and Allstate have announced thousands of new job cuts. And with winter approaching, restaurants and other businesses that were able to shift operations outdoors during warmer weather could be forced to pull back anew.

Separate data from the Census Bureau on Wednesday showed that 8.3 million Americans reported being behind on rent in mid-September, and 3.8 million reported that they were likely to be evicted in the next two months. Both figures have changed little since August. ""It seems increasingly unlikely that we'll have a deal before the election, and bills are due now,"" Mr. Zhao said. ""Every week that passes puts extra pressure on workers' households and small businesses, so any delay in the stimulus is going to have a meaningful impact on Americans."" The situation is particularly dire for people who lost their jobs early in the pandemic, many of whom are now nearing the end of their unemployment benefits. Last week was the 29th week since mass layoffs began in March. In most states, regular unemployment benefits last just 26 weeks, meaning that many people have already exhausted their benefits. In March, Congress created a program funded by the federal government for people whose state benefits have expired. The number of recipients under that program, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, swelled to nearly two million in mid-September, up from 1.4 million a month earlier. The program adds only 13 weeks of additional benefits, however, so people who lost their jobs in March will receive those benefits only until mid-December. And the entire program will expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn't extend it. A separate program, which existed before the pandemic, offers an additional 13 to 20 weeks of benefits, depending on the state. But the benefits are based on state economic conditions, and the rapid decline in the unemployment rate means that workers in several states, including Idaho, Wyoming and Utah, would no longer qualify for it. Missouri will join their ranks next week."

The film is as beautifully composed as Uzzle's pictures. The director Jethro Waters also shot the movie, a subtle feast of light and color. The animated sections illustrating Uzzle's past, by Cable Hardin, consist of white lines drawn against a deep gray background, and work beautifully. The music by Natalie Prass and Eric Slick is propulsive. This is a short film, and yes, when Uzzle isn't speaking of specifics, he does fall back on platitudes about the greatness of photography -- but he's still very much worth knowing. And this movie is a good introduction.

15913,"Tested Again, the Chiefs Flex Their Survival Skills","Kansas City (13-1) has come back in four of its last six games, and while the Chiefs do not seem invincible, they hardly seem beatable.",Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs earned their ninth straight win on Sunday.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/20/sports/20nfl-kcvsno-1/20nfl-kcvsno-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/sports/football/saints-chiefs-score-mahomes-brees.html,5331af90-1658-552d-ba22-17ca50ff8bef.jpg,"To an exclusive cohort in the N.F.L., the regular season serves as a preamble, offering those powerful teams 16 opportunities to tinker, learn and adapt. What might work in September might not in January, when the playoffs beckon. All the while, at every checkpoint but one the Kansas City Chiefs have flashed their credentials and scanned their irises. They have beaten lesser opponents and overwhelmed good ones. They have outlasted legendary quarterbacks and thwarted ferocious defenses. That happened again on Sunday, when in a potential Super Bowl preview the Chiefs defeated the Saints, 32-29, in New Orleans, a victory that showed off their toughness and survival skills. Facing their best competition of the season, the Chiefs blew a 14-point lead, went up by 14, then outlasted New Orleans with a lethal running attack to spoil Drew Brees's return from injured reserve. ""When you're playing one of the top defenses in the league, you've got to bear down,"" Chiefs Coach Andy Reid said. ""Everything's not going to be pretty.""

The last six games have tested Kansas City (13-1) to a considerable degree, exposing flaws while revealing what must be, for the rest of the league, an uncomfortable truth. The Chiefs won all six, coming back in four of them -- including avenging their lone loss, to Las Vegas -- and though they do not seem invincible, they hardly seem beatable. Even with the Saints swarming Patrick Mahomes as they did, sacking him four times and forcing a lost fumble, he still passed for three touchdowns, the Chiefs still gained 411 yards, they still scored on their first four red-zone opportunities and they still managed 32 points against what could be the league's best defense. The play that will linger longest was Mahomes's third-quarter touchdown to Mecole Hardman, the score that put them ahead to stay. Mahomes rolled left, pump-faked and, with a defender barreling in from his right, flicked the ball toward the back of the end zone. It sailed beyond the outstretched arms of Sammy Watkins and into those of Hardman, who dragged his feet in bounds, putting the Chiefs ahead, 21-15.

The Saints (10-4), like Kansas City, occupy rarefied space among the league's elite teams, and their defense was one of only two in the league that entered Sunday having allowed fewer than 300 yards a game. They dared the Chiefs to run, and so Le'Veon Bell and Clyde Edwards-Helaire did. Bell and Edwards-Helaire -- who left in the fourth quarter with a leg injury -- combined to rush 20 times for 90 yards and a touchdown, with Bell scoring off an option pitch from Mahomes in the second half.

Brees missed four games with 11 fractured ribs and a punctured lung, injuries that, presumably, made it difficult to breathe, eat, drink, sleep, sit and stand, let alone outwit the large men with bad intentions chasing him. Enticed by the prospect of facing the Chiefs, of dueling with Mahomes, Brees felt well enough to play. He slipped a protective shirt beneath his jersey and set about resuming his playoff preparation. Early on, his passes floated and wobbled, and his fourth of six straight incompletions to begin the game landed in the hands of the Chiefs rookie L'Jarius Sneed. Capitalizing on the takeaway, Kansas City scored seven plays later, on a 5-yard pass from Mahomes to Tyreek Hill, who fooled the Saints by motioning away from the play before reversing field to slip unnoticed into the end zone. It is ruthless, Kansas City's combination of speed, offensive creativity and coaching acumen. Also, endless. On their next scoring drive, the Chiefs further excavated their inventory of imaginative plays. At the Saints' 1-yard line, Mahomes did not receive the shotgun snap so much as redirect it to his right, a chest pass to tight end Travis Kelce for a touchdown. According to the N.F.L.'s Next Gen Stats, Mahomes's release time of 50-hundredths of a second was the fastest of any completion this season. The Chiefs led, 14-0, and New Orleans, into the second quarter, had yet to record a first down or a completion. It took until the Saints' fifth possession for them to get either, and on that same drive Brees seemed to summon all the strength in his right arm in connecting with Emmanuel Sanders down the sideline. The 51-yard pass play -- Brees's second-longest completion of the season -- escorted the Saints to the 3-yard line and ushered Brees off the field. During Brees's injury absence, Taysom Hill showcased his versatility across four full games, winning three of them. But the Saints' endgame is a championship, and with Brees back, Hill resumed his duties as a positionless dynamo, running on consecutive plays after the Sanders catch to cut Kansas City's lead to 14-7."

The Minneapolis brewery had finished the second batch of the beer, a banana-scented hefeweizen, before Minnesota moved to prevent the spread of the coronavirus outbreak by ending on-premises sales at bars, restaurants and taprooms on March 17.

Demand for draft beer dried up, and Bauhaus kegs and cans filled its distributor's warehouse, with no need for new inventory. On April 21, in a scene reminiscent of Prohibition, the brewery decided to send more than 900 gallons of perfectly good beer down the drain. For Bauhaus and other craft breweries, kegging or canning beer that can't be sold would be a wasted expense. And the beer is quickly approaching the dates set for peak freshness and quality, which then start to decline.

""It was a painful decision, and not one that we have ever had to make,"" said Drew Hurst, the director of operations. But with plenty of beer already on hand, ""there was literally nothing that we could do with it.""

Liquor and grocery stores are seeing increased sales of beer in cans and bottles, but shuttered bars and canceled events have created a backlog of draft beer -- some of which is being sent to wastewater treatment plants for disposal, freeing up tanks and kegs for breweries to restart future production."

Ms. Lark, a violinist, was eating dinner last Saturday at a long table crowded with musicians and their families. Later in the evening, she was to perform Brahms's Piano Quintet alongside the pianist Mitsuko Uchida, Marlboro's artistic director.

The pianist Jonathan Biss, noticing my confusion, leaned forward. ""It's so intense here,"" he said, ""and you're playing for hours a day, that behaving like an idiot is an essential release.""

Intensity and freedom may be the defining qualities of Marlboro. (As are the dinnertime paper fights, apparently a tradition.) Since the festival's founding in 1951, this dairy farm turned liberal arts college has become the summer home for a thriving community of musicians who delve into the chamber repertory with a devotion bordering on zeal. Veteran artists and young professionals play side by side and feed off one another's energy and experience. But the most extravagant gift Marlboro offers participants is a commodity that has become only more precious: time.

Chamber groups here have the luxury of rehearsing as long as they need. Public concerts each weekend and a Musicians from Marlboro tour during the regular season represent only a fraction of the works studied each session. Some groups spend the whole summer on a single piece."

What books are on your nightstand? ""In the Wake,"" by Christina Sharpe; ""Dimestore,"" by Lee Smith; ""This Will Be My Undoing,"" by Morgan Jerkins and ""Stories of Scottsboro,"" by James Goodman. What's the last great book you read? ""Never Let Me Go,"" by Kazuo Ishiguro. I don't know how this one missed me, but I read it last year and I was so smitten that I changed my syllabus so that I could require my grad students to read it and talk about it as much as I wanted. What's your favorite book no one else has heard of? This is tricky because you have to define ""no one."" It makes me think of Toni Morrison's famous interrogation of Ralph Ellison: ""Invisible to whom?"" With that qualifier in place, I'll say ""The Darkest Child,"" by Delores Phillips, a stirring coming-of-age story set at the cusp of the civil rights movement. It's a heartbreaker -- there has never been a more problematic mother-daughter relationship in all of literature. But it's also a heart-healer. Soho Press is putting out a gorgeous reissue that I hope will cement the author's legacy and get this important book into everyone's hands.

What's the last book that made you laugh? ""Heads of the Colored People,"" by Nafissa Thompson-Spires. We need a new word for this story collection. Dark humor isn't quite it. But it's close. It's dark; it's funny; but it's kind, too. The last book to make you cry? ""White Houses,"" by Amy Bloom. At the center of this great American novel is the great American love story of Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok. Eleanor is the name everyone knows, but after this book Lorena will be a name you will never forget. Love is always hard and always worth it. The last book that made you furious? ""Cutting School,"" by Noliwe Rooks. My hair almost caught on fire when I read the chapter about single moms tossed into prison -- prison -- for trying to enroll their children into schools in better-resourced neighborhoods. Imagine little kids stuck in foster care all because their mothers wanted them to have a decent education. I threw the book across the room and paced the floor. This is an important work; hopefully it will make people mad enough to act. Sing the praises of an overlooked or underappreciated writer we should know about. Katherine Vaz is the sort of fiction writer who makes me wonder why the rest of us even bother. Much of her work explores the Luso-American experience in California, where she was born and raised. Her work has a delicious sadness to it that I couldn't quite define until I visited Lisbon. The Portuguese have this emotion they called ""saudade,"" a sort of beautiful longing. Imagine the blues, but a little bluer and not as funny. It brings to mind what Toni Morrison says in the dedication to ""Sula"" about the ""sheer good fortune to miss somebody long before they leave you."" It's the textured sadness that comes from love. My favorite book of Vaz's is ""Our Lady of the Artichokes."" Which writers -- novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets -- working today do you admire most?

Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? I adore mysteries, but I don't care for thrillers. I like my dead body in Chapter 1, and then spending the rest of the novel figuring it out. Motives should be love, money or revenge. Spare me the sick stuff. I don't care for thrillers that spend every other chapter in the mind of a psychopath who murders prostitutes with a potato peeler. I'll take Kinsey Millhone over a down-and-dirty Scandinavian any day. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night? The dreamiest setup for reading is a hardcover book and a first-class seat on an overseas flight. I accepted a gig in Dubai just for 18 hours of luxurious reading time. But in real life, just give me morning light and a clean, quiet room. No screens. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I was reared in an unreligious household, so most friends are surprised to find a Bible on my shelf. My father marvels that I can recite so many of the Psalms. I've come to understand that, as a black Southerner, I am a Christian, whether I am observant or not. It's woven into the fabric of the culture. There are a lot of us -- people who may not belong to a church, but are fluent in the language and sensibility of religion. I don't know that I could write a good book about the South without being well versed in the Good Book. What's the best book you've ever received as a gift? My greatest desire is to own the entire ""Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers."" Forty dainty hardcovers. I had my eye on a set online, but my dear friend (and genius playwright) Branden Jacobs-Jenkins bought it out from under me before I got my coins together. ""Don't be mad,"" he said. We found another set, but the deal fell through. This year he shared his volumes with me. I am most intrigued by ""A Biografy of the Slav Who Whipt Her Mistres and Gand Her Fredom."" Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain? I tend to fall for the minor characters, the scene stealers. About three-fourths of the way through ""Song of Solomon,"" Magdalene, the neglected sister, rises up and gives her brother some inspired suggestions as to where he can shove his toxic masculinity. For me, she's the jewel of Morrison's whole oeuvre."
8711,Facebook Can't Be Reformed,We need to reimagine the social network or find a way to survive its dominance.,Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook has been in a defensive posture since the 2016 election.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/opinion/01warzel1/01warzel1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cccc8da15d15a9427432061402bb15373629cd782fb55e2b8b9e0483eb98723f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/opinion/facebook-zuckerberg.html,48ee6d65-d1a5-5d38-acf5-fc825525f38f.jpg,"""We know we have more work to do."" That was the line from numerous Facebook representatives last week in reaction to the #StopHateForProfit advertising boycott campaign. Intended to pressure the company to curb hate speech and misinformation, the boycott has been joined by several high-profile brands, including Unilever and Verizon, and could make a rare dent in Facebook's ad revenue. The campaign seems to be having an effect. On Friday, Facebook announced that it would add labels to content about voting and expand its hate speech policies. The company also added a ""newsworthy"" tag for hateful content from political figures that violates rules but is allowed because of its news value. Facebook stressed that all these moves were part of a continuing cleanup. ""We know we have more work to do,"" the statement read. We Know We Have More Work to Do (let's call it W.K.W.H.M.W.T.D. for short) is the definitive utterance of the social media era, trotted out by executives whenever their companies come in for a public shaming. In just eight words, it encapsulates the defensive posture that Facebook has been crouched in ever since the 2016 election, when it became clear that its tolerance of hate-filled communities on its platforms turned them into witting vectors for disinformation and propaganda.

The phrase is both a promise and a deflection. It's a plea for unearned trust -- give us time, we are working toward progress. And it cuts off meaningful criticism -- yes, we know this isn't enough, but more is coming. In Facebook's case, what is most dangerous about W.K.W.H.M.W.T.D. is that it glosses over the fundamental structural flaws in the platform. The architecture of the social network -- its algorithmic mandate of engagement over all else, the advantage it gives to divisive and emotionally manipulative content -- will always produce more objectionable content at a dizzying scale. Facebook frequently uses its unfathomable amount of content as an excuse for inaction. ""We've made huge strides,"" a Facebook spokesman, Nick Clegg, said on CNN last Sunday. ""But, you know, on an average day, there are 115 billion, 115 billion messages sent on our services around the world, and the vast, vast, vast majority of that is positive."" But Mr. Clegg's defense is also an admission: Facebook is too big to govern responsibly. There will always be more work to do because Facebook's design will always produce more hate than anyone could monitor. How do you reform that? You can't. Lately, my thoughts on Facebook have been influenced by two separate movements: prison abolition and the push to defund police. There are complex policy issues involved, but the central premise of these movements is elegant in its simplicity. The bloated and corrupt institutions that they critique are beyond reform. As Mariame Kaba wrote in a recent Times Op-Ed essay on defunding the police, ""We need to change our demands.""

To be clear, there is no one-to-one comparison between Facebook and the police or the carceral state. Modern policing, as Ms. Kaba notes, has its origins in slave patrols. Facebook's origins are obviously much different. Still, the movements provide a helpful lens through which to view Facebook. Despite the exhausting debates around content moderation policies and constant incremental tweaks to its rules and policies, glaring problems persist. All signs point to a system beyond reform. ""You see lots of people putting forth a hopeful idea of a new, humane social media platform to rescue us -- one that respects privacy or is less algorithmically coercive,"" Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, told me recently. ""But if we're being honest, what they're really proposing at that point is not really social media anymore."" In other words, the architecture is the problem. ""I think social media have been bad for humans. And we shouldn't keep trying to imagine we should either fix or reinvent what is fundamentally a bad idea,"" he said. Ifeoma Ozoma, who helped lead public policy and social impact at Pinterest and worked on public policy efforts at Facebook and Google, argues that Facebook's flawed architecture and its leadership are inextricably linked. ""We're not going to see real change if we're just asking for edits on the edges,"" she told me. ""The platform will reflect the values of the people that make the decisions. If you have people working at the platforms that are bought into perpetuating a system of white supremacy or unwilling to reckon with it, then that's what it'll start looking like."" Ms. Ozoma, who designed policy changes to limit the spread of medical misinformation and hate speech on social media platforms, speaks from her own experience in Silicon Valley. She has publicly criticized social media companies' leaders for inequitable pay, and in one recent thread, said that her managers undermined the work of people of color with ""racism, gaslighting and disrespect.""

""Even if you came up with a framework that reconfigured the platform structurally, you're not going to see the reform or implementation,"" she said. ""You're not going to see Facebook's leaders admit what they did over the last decade is wrong and harmful."" Few who know Facebook really believe that Mark Zuckerberg will dismantle his company or relax his grip on the board, placing conversations like this one more in the realm of thought experiment than in reality. But for those of us who are at the whims of the company's power, the status quo also seems untenable. Small reforms are crucial, but they also suggest that the current iteration can be saved -- that there's more work to do. Facebook cannot be reformed. We need to change our demands. The#StopHateForProfit campaign is one such change, but there are others. Mr. Vaidhyanathan told me that he is thinking less about policing Facebook's platforms; he is trying to imagine ways to help us live in a world dominated by Facebook. ""We probably have to start thinking more radically about what kind of information ecosystem we need to survive as a democratic republic,"" he said. His ideas include what he described as ""boring"" but essential things like investing in libraries and public schools. There are other ideas, like declaring ""platform bankruptcy."" This would involve platforms resetting all of their user and group follower counts to zero and rebuilding communities from the ground up, with the platforms' current rules in place. There's no shortage of ideas on this subject, as my Opinion colleague Annalee Newitz wrote last year: ""We need to stop handing off responsibility for maintaining public space to corporations and algorithms -- and give it back to human beings."" I put the question to my Twitter followers, asking for their best ideas to fix tech platforms and received over 1,000 responses in a few hours."

The family cars, all with Massachusetts license plates, were parked in the front yard. The officers took notes of the family members' names and date of arrival into town and instructed them to continue self-isolating.

The guards left the family with a flier including ""10 Tips for At-Home Quarantine or Self-Monitoring"" during the coronavirus pandemic. As stay-at-home orders have spread across the United States, a number of states have moved to restrict the arrival of nonresidents and make sure that they quarantine for 14 days. Governors in states including Rhode Island, Florida and Texas have implemented interstate travel restrictions, including stopping some drivers coming from out of state at the border to remind them of the quarantine requirement. No state has blocked drivers from passing through on their way to their final destination. Some municipalities are adding restrictions of their own. In New Jersey, the city of Newark, and the nearby towns of Irvington, Orange and East Orange are turning around drivers seeking to cross their town lines whose travel is seen as nonessential. The restrictions came on the heels of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's executive order restricting movement in the state, which currently has more cases than anywhere in the country except New York. Mayor Ras J. Baraka of Newark said in a YouTube video that the so-called operation lockdown, which will last at least seven days from March 31, stations police officers in Newark, and surrounding municipalities at town borders to ensure that ""cars are not moving about unnecessarily, that people are not traversing back and forth from city to city in purposes that are not for emergencies only.""

Officers will stop drivers to determine their reason for being on the road and issue summonses for any nonessential travel. Read More on the Coronavirus Pandemic

Additionally, some locations have installed tap and pay machines to limit person-to-person contact. These tips come from AAA and NATSO. In the Florida Keys, local authorities instigated traffic stops at the entrance of both main roads into the Keys on March 27. At the time, Monroe County had 16 cases of Covid-19, while neighboring counties had far more. Although hotels in the Florida Keys had stopped taking hotel reservations about a week earlier, local officials noticed that large numbers of nonresidents were still arriving in the islands.

""This is not who the Keys are. We believe in freedom of expression and freedom of movement,"" Mayor Carruthers said. ""Our motto has always been: 'Come as you are.' But I guess now our motto is 'Come as you are -- later on.'"" Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, issued an executive order March 27 restricting some interstate travel. As a result, the state's Department of Transportation working with the Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Department of Health implemented two checkpoints screening motorists coming from areas with significant community spread, at the Alabama/Florida state line on I-10 and the Georgia/Florida state line on I-95. (Governor DeSantis later instructed residents to stay at home.) Meanwhile, residents driving in Laredo, Texas, face a $1,000 fine if they do not cover their faces with a proper or makeshift mask when pumping gas. A general manager at a truck stop in town was threatened with arrest if he served someone without a mask, said Tiffany Wlazlowski Neuman, vice president of public affairs for NATSO, an industry group that represents truck stops and travel plazas. ""Employees are working round the clock to keep their locations clean and truck drivers on the road,"" she said. ""Now they are being asked to police their customers."" Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas has issued a slew of executive orders and proclamations over the course of five days in late March, limiting travelers both in the air and on the road. Anyone driving into Texas from Louisiana, which has more than 13,000 cases, will be stopped by the Texas Department of Public Safety and required to self-quarantine for 14 days. (Governor Abbott issued a longer list of cities and states with mandatory self-quarantine rules for people coming from airports there.) While the constitution ensures drivers a ""right to travel"" -- meaning the right to cross state borders -- states also have the right to exercise their police power to protect themselves from disease, said Gillian Metzger, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia Law School. Therefore, even state measures that target interstate travel may be constitutional -- so long as no better less restrictive alternative exists.

""In the midst of a pandemic, state governments have very strong power to make restrictions in the name of public health,"" Professor Metzger said, adding: ""As we know more about the virus, as we do more testing, the kinds of restrictions that will be allowed will change."" One exception: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York threatened to sue the state of Rhode Island when the governor there considered stopping cars with New York license plates at the border March 28. Soon after, Gov. Gina Raimondo changed tactics, signing an executive order instructing anyone -- not just New Yorkers but even other Rhode Islanders -- coming from out of state to quarantine at home for 14 days. Data suggests that a restriction of movement helps to slow the rate of infection. But the government -- whether local, state or federal -- likely cannot keep all of the 273.6 million vehicles registered in the United States off the road. ""Much of the control of the outbreak in the U.S. will depend on individuals in the U.S. making good choices,"" said Dr. Henry Wu, director of Emory TravelWell Center in Atlanta, which provides health services for international travelers. Noting the asymmetric nature of the disease -- different parts of the country experiencing different stages of the pandemic -- he said, ""increased travel between different regions of the country would increase the likelihood that it would spread."" Even AAA suggests that you ""talk to your health care provider"" before you go. Some of the country's most famous drives, like California's Route 1, remain open. But authorities along some roadways -- like the Blue Ridge Parkway -- are trying to discourage its use. Drivers there can still take in the scenic views of the Shenandoah Valley, but will find that restrooms, visitor centers and campgrounds along the route are closed. Allen Pietrobon, an assistant professor of Global Affairs at Trinity Washington University in Washington, D.C., who teaches a course titled ""The Great American Road Trip,"" said that the two most comparable driving restrictions go back to the oil crisis of 1973 and World War II, when car manufacturing was halted, all pleasure driving in some eastern states was temporarily prohibited and rations limited drivers in some places to as little as 3 gallons of gas per week. (""When you ride ALONE you ride with Hitler!"" propaganda posters warned.)"
40447,When Japan Had a Third Gender,"For centuries before Japan adopted Western sexual mores, its ideas of gender were elastic, with male adolescents seen as the height of beauty.","An original perspective picture of the Great Gateway and Nakano-cho in the Shin Yoshiwara, (1730s–1740s), by Okumura Masanobu.

The work is part of ""A Third Gender: Beautiful Youths in Japanese Prints,"" at the Japan Society.



A figure in a translucent kimono coyly holds a fan. Another arranges an iris in a vase. Are they men or women? As a mind-bending exhibition that opened Friday at the Japan Society illustrates, they are what scholars call a third gender -- adolescent males seen as the height of beauty in early modern Japan who were sexually available to both men and women. Known as wakashu, they are one of several examples in the show that reveal how elastic the ideas of gender were before Japan adopted Western sexual mores in the late 1800s. The show, ""A Third Gender: Beautiful Youths in Japanese Prints,"" arrives at a time of ferment about gender roles in the United States and abroad. Bathroom rights for transgender people have become a cultural flash point. The notion of ""gender fluidity"" -- that it's not necessary to identify as either male or female, that gender can be expressed as a continuum -- is roiling traditional definitions.

She said that like other societies in the past and present -- the hijra in India; the ""two-spirit people"" in some American indigenous cultures -- the diversity in gender definitions and sexual practices in Edo Japan challenges modern notions that male and female are clear either-or identities. The art on display shows how many permutations were acceptable in Edo society: men or women in liaisons with the adolescent wakashu; female geisha dressing like wakashu and engaging in rough sex; male prostitutes cross-dressing as women; men impersonating women on the Kabuki stage, a tradition that lasts to this day; and even a male Kabuki actor impersonating a woman who pretends at one point to be a man.

In some cases, there are sly literary allusions that deliberately transpose gender. These prints depict episodes from classical literature, or Buddhist and Confucian traditions, but flip the genders of the main characters, or recast the men as wakashu. The art in the exhibition ranges from lively snapshots of daily life to uninhibited portrayals of desire. A screen shows several wakashu surrounding a Buddhist monk, teasingly holding down his hands, plying him with alcohol and tickling his feet, suggesting foreplay before male-male sex. A young woman passes a love note to her wakashu lover behind the back of an older artist who is signing his name to a painting. A wakashu dreams of sex with a famous prostitute, while another woman tenderly covers him with a jacket.

Several prints reflect Edo society's strict hierarchy of class and age, one reason the curators caution it is misleading to compare gender norms directly to the present day. The Edo period was one of relative peace in Japan, following many years of war between competing samurai. It was also marked by nearly complete isolation from the West. That is one reason it may have offered space for sexual experimentation, but only within certain bounds.

Any hint of adult male-male sex was confined to outcast groups such as Kabuki actors, said Michael Chagnon, the curator of exhibit interpretation at the Japan Society, although homosexuality was practiced among samurai for centuries and commercialized during the Edo period. Men are usually in charge, both in pursuit of sexual partners and in sexual positions, except for experienced women who pursue younger wakashu. There is virtually no depiction of lesbianism, since women were not granted the sexual freedoms men were. The only print showing two naked women is ambiguous, with art historians uncertain whether it suggests mutual desire. Older men have sex with younger wakashu. The exhibition raises and confronts questions of pederasty or exploitation, given that wakashu were sexually available after puberty, younger than would now be considered the age of consent. The curators consulted social workers and lawyers during the original exhibit, held at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, to make sure the work was not considered child pornography. Mr. Chagnon said marriages and sexual liaisons took place at an earlier age than the present day, partly because people died so much younger, often by their late 30s. The notion of age of consent did not exist in Edo Japan, he said, and was imported later.

The Edo period ended after Japan was humiliated by demands from a militarily superior West - the black ships of Commodore Perry wrested concessions from a country that had once confined Western traders to offshore islands. And it was then in the late 1860s, as Japan rushed to adopt Western technology and forms of government, that it also imported more rigid Western notions of gender and permissible sexual expression. The tradition of wakashu ended. Homosexuality was outlawed for a time. Same-sex marriage is not legal in Japan today, although it was debated in the legislature in 2015 and some cities have allowed partnership certificates for same-sex couples. A gay subculture flourishes, with many artists playfully shifting and layering identities, mainly through the internet. But gay men are generally expected to marry women and produce children, fulfilling social expectations while conducting their sexual lives discreetly. In an uncanny echo of the past, some Japanese men today, known as ""genderless danshi,"" are once again blurring lines, dressing androgynously, using makeup or wearing clothes typically seen as feminine. ""Even though we have this rich tradition of gender, prints like these are not found in our textbooks,"" said Professor Ikeda, who grew up in Japan. ""We don't do these kinds of exhibitions in Japan."" It is one of the many reflections on contemporary society that this provocative exhibition raises. Walking through it is a reckoning with categories, definitions and how they resonate in societies still uncertain about whether lines between genders should be bent or blurred."
36185,Was This Homage to Bratwurst Really Designed by Robert Indiana?,"The sausage company that commissioned it believes it was, despite a disputed image of the artist that may have been altered.","The letter R is lowered into place at the Johnsonville Sausage headquarters in Sheboygan County, Wis., earlier this month.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/22/arts/22Indiana1/21Indiana1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8230526c3b3c67cd5b787faf6db44f21e7e6a267a3cd4b54571bdb21d1134ff3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/arts/design/robert-indiana-bratwurst-sculpture.html,222aad39-45d5-55bb-82e2-01017693808c.jpg,"Just how much control did the artist Robert Indiana have over his work during the last years of his life? A lot, according to two of the artist's associates: his caretaker in Maine, Jamie L. Thomas, and a New York art publisher, Michael McKenzie, who worked closely with the artist. Very little, according to a lawsuit filed this spring that accused both men of exploiting Mr. Indiana's advanced age to sell bogus artworks that they attributed to him. One focal point of the debate has been ""BRAT,"" a huge sculpture said to have been Indiana's last monumental work, designed not as a homage to an ethereal concept like Mr. Indiana's ""LOVE"" or ""HOPE,"" but to the humble bratwurst. Skeptics said they were dubious that Mr. Indiana, who died in May at 89, actually signed off on the work commissioned last year by Johnsonville Sausage in Wisconsin.

""I knew I had seen that picture of Bob somewhere,"" said Ms. Rogers. ""I zeroed right in on it. It resonated with me. I knew it was not right."" Shelly Stayer, who owns the sausage company with her husband, Ralph, said the dispute over the image did not diminish her confidence that Mr. Indiana had designed the sculpture. She said she had exchanged multiple emails with Mr. McKenzie and others as part of a lengthy and rigorous process that resulted in a design that she believes Mr. Indiana approved. ""We have a signed sculpture by Robert Indiana and we absolutely love it,"" Ms. Stayer said. ""Nothing else matters."" Mr. McKenzie, who took part in multiple projects with Mr. Indiana over the years including ""HOPE,"" one of Mr. Indiana's most famous works, said in an interview that he could not say for sure who had taken the disputed photo or sent it to Ms. Stayer. But he said it had been taken inside a studio he operated in Maine, on the remote island of Vinalhaven, where Mr. Indiana lived for many decades. And he acknowledged it was possible that someone, perhaps one of his staff, had altered it by adding the ""BRAT"" print to cheer him up. Mr. Indiana had approved the ""BRAT"" design, Mr. McKenzie said, but he had failed to document the artist signing the print displayed in the photograph, as he had hoped.

""Maybe they heard me crying that I missed the shot,"" he said, adding: ""Nobody did it to swindle anybody."" The federal lawsuit that challenges how much of a role Mr. Indiana had in some of the art sold under his name was filed in May by Morgan Art Foundation, a company that holds the rights to some of Mr. Indiana's works. In his final years, Mr. Indiana lived as a near recluse in an old Victorian lodge hall on Vinalhaven and the suit asserts that his caretaker, Mr. Thomas, intentionally cut him off from old friends and business associates, a charge that Mr. Thomas has denied. Ms. Dlugopolski said Ms. Stayer and her husband, had begun discussions about the sculpture idea in early 2017. A blog post on the Johnsonville website describes the Stayers as art lovers who had previously collaborated with the artist Frank Stella on a 3,800-pound starlike sculpture that is also displayed at the company's headquarters. At first, the Stayers had hoped to work closely with Mr. Indiana but soon learned that was not to be, the post said. It quoted Ms. Stayer as saying ""He certainly was the temperamental artist as others had described to me."""

Hess gave Chinatown -- the entire neighborhood -- four stars. It was the highest rating he ever dispensed, and an acknowledgment that whether you eat poorly or well can depend less on the skills of a particular chef than on your openness to experience. I'd extend those stars to all of New York City, home to almost every cuisine on earth, each claiming a tenuous foothold in an ever-shifting landscape. The surest way to a memorable meal is to walk the streets: to trawl the sidewalks of southern Brooklyn all the way down to the Coney Island Boardwalk; to follow the No. 7 train through Queens to its end, and beyond; to pop into each bodega along the way in case there's a secret taqueria at the back; to point at a menu written in a language you don't know, make a wild guess and hope for the best. Here are the favorite small restaurants from a year of wandering, chosen by me and my Hungry City colleagues, Marian Bull and Mahira Rivers. They're idiosyncratic spots, often family-run, sometimes direly understaffed, erratic in hours and quality but, when stumbled upon at the right moment, surpassing the loftiest of dining rooms in generosity of spirit -- the kind of places that make living and eating in this city a perpetual revelation.

Pierre Thiam grew up in Dakar, Senegal, and came to the United States three decades ago in hopes of studying physics. Instead, the kitchen called. Now he oversees high-end restaurants in Dakar and Lagos, Nigeria, along with Yolele Foods, an importer of fonio, an ancient African grain with a texture like crumbled cloud. At this serene cafeteria that opened in February in the lobby of the Africa Center, on Fifth Avenue across from Central Park, low-slung chairs and tables built from repurposed refrigerators nestle among frilly palms and trailing vines. Long wooden tables run down the middle, where diners commune over Mr. Thiam's vivid precolonial West African dishes: malleable boulders of fufu, boiled plantains pounded under a steady stream of palm oil; egusi, traditionally a cassava-leaf stew, here made with collards, honoring the influence of the African-American diaspora; and fonio stained crimson by jollof, tomatoes broken down with a crush of baobab leaves and whole Scotch bonnets.

Each dish at this Thai restaurant has the effect of a lit-up, all-systems-go pinball machine: A single bite pings from sweet to sour to salty to funky to crunchy, tied together with a gleeful ding-ding-ding! of pleasure. The crispy rice salad, its grains formed into perfumed balls that are fried until deep brown, is then broken apart and tossed with a tangy, brilliant dressing and a handful of torn sour sausage. It's the sort of thing you want to hoover. Chiraporn Sornphoom, an owner and manager, opened the restaurant in 2017 with two of her sisters and a friend, in hopes of sharing the food of their native Isan region with Queens. They make their own pla ra, the rabidly funky fermented fish sauce, in house, a process that takes three to four months. The oceanic liquor pops up in an array of papaya salads, many studded with salted or preserved sea creatures, leaning into brininess. MARIAN BULL

The food of Iraq is not widely known in America, despite the decades-long tangle of our countries' fates, and few New York menus have ever showcased the cuisine. But since July, Mohammed Almandalawi -- the Mississippi-born son of Iraqi immigrants -- has been cooking the dishes of his childhood at this bare-bones restaurant in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, a neighborhood that is home to a growing Arab population. Lamb is celebrated in dish after dish: indulgently braised hunks of shoulder and shank arrayed over golden rice musky from cardamom; ground lamb tucked inside hollowed-out orbs of onion and trunks of eggplant, a process so labor-intensive that Mr. Almandalawi reserves it for weekends; and lamb broth, plush on the tongue, suffusing bamia, a slow breakdown of okra and tomatoes. For now, offerings are few (and sometimes sell out). Be patient, for Mr. Almandalawi is the restaurant's entire staff, waiting tables, writing down orders and then hurrying back to the kitchen to cook them. LIGAYA MISHAN

This single-minded enterprise is devoted to cheong fun, broad floppy rice noodles, translucent and almost gooey, rolled around nubs of pork, beef or shrimp (plump or dried into briny knots), scallions and cilantro, crunchy bean sprouts and glimmers of corn. Versions bought from street carts tend to be snacks, the fillings slightly impressionistic; here, cheong fun is a meal, especially when mottled with egg or half-submerged in a sauce of peanut butter, vinegar and sesame paste, with curry fish balls staggered across it like a game of marbles. Joe Rong, a native of Taishan in Guangdong Province, China, grinds rice daily in electric stone mills to achieve noodles of remarkable pliancy and earthiness.

At 24, Alexander Yip was the youngest restaurant owner I met this year. His Hong Kong-style rice casserole restaurant, Clay Pot, opened on St. Marks Place in the East Village in early 2018. A second location opened in the West Village about a year later. Mr. Yip's quick, and early, success might have something to do with growing up in the restaurant business -- his father owned Jebon, a pan-Asian fixture on St. Marks Place (just one avenue west of Clay Pot) -- that closed in April. The specialty at Clay Pot is a dish Mr. Yip remembers eating as a child while living in Manhattan's Chinatown: jasmine rice steamed and served in an earthenware pot, with a customizable medley of toppings rich in salt and fat (to abundantly season the plain rice below). The method was perfected by Mr. Yip's chef, Julian Yu, and delivers a sizzled shell of crisp, nutty rice at the bottom of the pot, every time. MAHIRA RIVERS

Although Millie Peartree was born in the Bronx, her restaurant looks back to the Southern cooking of her mother, Millie Bell of Savannah, Ga. Deliveries of seafood -- whiting, catfish, fist-size curls of shrimp -- come in daily, to be dredged in cornmeal and strategically deployed seasonings, then fried to order. On the side: French fries wafting Old Bay, cornbread gilded in honey butter, and mac and cheese made in the looser, freer custard style, with a crosshatching of sharp Cheddar, its milder cousin and Monterey Jack, reaching the diner in giddy stages of melt. The restaurant opened in 2017 as a takeout spot in Fordham Manor, the Bronx, and last March expanded to a larger storefront next door, with proper tables and chairs. Then, just before Thanksgiving, Ms. Peartree suffered a blow: A gas leak in the building forced her to close. While she searches for a new space, she is still taking catering orders. Lucky us.

Granted, the traditional traffic of the stage -- with flesh-and-blood actors sharing a space with flesh-and-blood audiences -- has almost entirely ceased in this age of social isolation. But to devoted lovers of dramas, comedies and musicals, star turns from as long ago as the mid-20th century continue to thrill in radiant recollection. Such was the overwhelming evidence offered by responses to my essay on great acting remembered, which ran last month. Hundreds of readers wrote in to testify about performances that still burn brightly in their memories. Their selections span more than half a century, from Claudia McNeil in ""A Raisin in the Sun"" in 1959 to Glenn Close in ""Sunset Boulevard"" more than 50 years later. What follows is an edited sampling of excited, lovingly specific evocations of mythic performances -- acting that still feels as fresh as last night.

As a young theater student, in late December 1981, I saw Gregory Hines in ""Sophisticated Ladies"" at the Lunt-Fontanne. By some magic, it was his final performance in the run. He stopped the show cold. Twice. Once in the first act, then again in second. I had never seen anything like it. Nor have I since. Joe H, Cincinnati Jessica Tandy in ""Foxfire."" At one point she was remembering her youth and leapt onto a table. Although she was in her early 70s, the transition was totally believable. Sally Parry, Bloomington, Ill. I made a beeline to Broadway when Ralph Fiennes was cast in ""Hamlet"" after falling head-over-heels for his work in the perennially underappreciated 1994 film ""Quiz Show."" Early in the performance, clad in head-to-toe black, silent, and with his back turned to the audience, Fiennes was still the only thing you could look at. Presence personified. He rightly won the Tony for his work. Rebecca B, Tacoma, Wash.

I snagged a single ticket in the fourth row to see John Malkovich in ""Burn This."" On entering the theater, I reflected on the fact that I knew women who found him attractive, which baffled me. Not long after his entrance, I found myself wanting to jump onto the stage and offer myself to him then and there. MKORAL, Pittsburgh, Pa. The 1980s production of ""Death of a Salesman,"" with Dustin Hoffman as Willy Loman. The performance that haunts me to this day wasn't Hoffman's, but that of the young actor who played Willy's son Biff: John Malkovich. Mindi, Sherman Oaks, Calif.

Kristin Scott Thomas in the 2008 revival of ""The Seagull"" was stunningly powerful. It changed how I understood Chekhov, it changed my understanding of the play, it changed my understanding of myself. AYD, New York Zoe Caldwell in Terrence McNally's ""Master Class."" When Ms. Caldwell walked onto that stage and uttered her opening line, it was as if she'd reached out into the audience and grabbed my heart in her fist, and didn't let go until the play ended. The whole audience was vibrating in her grip. Maxie, NYC-LA

Kathy Bates was harrowing in ""'Night Mother."" So matter-of-fact. And there was actually a clock on the wall, in real time, so that you'd see the minutes ticking by, before her planned suicide. John B. Archibald, St. Petersburg, Fla. Oh, to see the perfect Len Cariou in ""Sweeney Todd"" again. Karen Lorentz, Jersey City, N.J. Meryl Streep in Brecht's ""Mother Courage and Her Children"" in 2006 at Central Park's Delacorte Theater. The remnants of Hurricane Ernesto were pounding the East Coast. The show had three rain delays. Watching Streep both adjust her performance because of the weather (she and the other actors were changing the blocking on the fly to avoid getting pounded directly in the face by the heavy rain) and ignore it (throwing herself on the ground now meant throwing herself in a mud pit) was astounding. Andy Gray, Niles, Ohio

I could. Not. Blink. Watching a mesmerizing Raul Esparza in ""Company."" JP Stephenson, Emeryville, Calif. The return to Broadway of Diana Rigg in ""Medea."" I remember feeling paralyzed with wonder. MOLLY BLOOM, Tri-state Rex Harrison in a piece of fluff called ""Aren't We All?"" He came on, scooped the entire audience up in his hands, proceeded to juggle them like a rubber ball for the rest of the evening, and walked off at the end with a sly, self-satisfied grin on his face. R Stuart, North Carolina I was a little nine-year-old black girl from Chicago when my mother and I dressed in our Sunday best and went to the Auditorium Theater to see Sammy Davis Jr. in ""Golden Boy. "" I had never been to the theater and to say I was mesmerized would be an understatement. Greer, Chicago"
47915,Eli Zabar's Wine Cellar: It's Not Chopped Liver,"The famed food retailer collects and sells Burgundy — his way, as always.",Eli Zabar's markets and takeout shops dominate the Upper East Side.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/16/dining/16POUR1/16POUR1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=f3e4c0993f948da2082d5a52617c79a0d2073aa9dbbae68a6b9ccea16e40f183&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/elis-zabars-wine-cellar.html,176fae91-8873-5d81-beba-ed35616a81c6.jpg,"Many New Yorkers know at least something about Eli Zabar. They can probably guess that his family opened the Upper West Side emporium that stands for classic New York eating. They may know that he left that business decades ago to open his own store on the Upper East Side, E.A.T., followed by Eli's at the Vinegar Factory, and that his markets and takeout shops now dominate the neighborhood above 79th Street. They can assume that Eli's Bread, sold in restaurants and shops all over New York, comes from his bakeries. They may even be aware of Mr. Zabar's reputation for treating his customers arrogantly and charging high prices. Not so many know that Mr. Zabar is a longtime wine lover, with an extraordinary collection of Burgundy and a deep interest in Barolo, Barbaresco and the northern Rhone. Mr. Zabar owns an excellent under-the-radar, typically quirky wine shop on the Upper East Side called Eli's List, right next door to his restaurant Eli's Table, which offers a terrific wine list with many bottles 10 to 25 years old. Many people would be astonished to find great values on this list, and not just in expensive bottles. And they may be pleased to know that a branch of Eli's Essentials, his takeout shop and cafe at Madison Avenue and 91st Street, turns into a charming wine bar after 5 p.m.

Mr. Zabar said he never intended to go into the wine business. He opened his wine shop in 2002, he said, as a convenience to his wine-drinking customers at Eli's Market on Third Avenue, so he could offer one-stop shopping. That was, he now concedes, a rationalization for doing what he wanted: to accumulate a lot of wine. ""It was antithetical to the rest of my businesses, which are based on buying fresh and selling fast,"" he said at the wine shop, preternaturally blue eyes peering over the top of his glasses. ""You're not going to save a carrot for two months."" Mr. Zabar, 72, exudes the nervous energy of a teenager. Words tumble out on top of one another, disparate thoughts that, in his eagerness to discuss wine, can seem at first to lack an organizing principle, until they finally align and fall into place. One dress shirt is not enough; he wears two at once, with khakis and a down vest. The layers come in handy in the cramped, mazelike wine cellar under Eli's Market, where, stacked at a cool 55 degrees, lie cases upon cases of bottles that would stir the imagination of any Burgundy lover. Sure, he has some superstar names: Roumier of Chambolle-Musigny and Rousseau of Gevrey-Chambertin among the reds; Raveneau of Chablis, Roulot of Meursault and Leflaive of Puligny-Montrachet among the whites.

But even more evident is his exquisite taste. His cellar is replete with the work of producers who have not been sanctified as superstars and are not known for their grand crus, but who simply make beautiful, expressive wines whatever their terroirs. These include names like Domaine Arlaud Pere et Fils, Domaine Trapet, Alain Burguet, Sylvain Cathiard, Mugneret-Gibourg, Denis Bachelet and Michel Lafarge. ""These are not trophy wines,"" Mr. Zabar said. ""That's not my point of view."" This cellar is practically all Burgundy, except for some Champagne. Mr. Zabar has another cellar for his Rhones and Barolos under Eli's Night Shift on East 79th Street, a grab-and-go store that turns into a beer bar by night, run by his son Oliver.

As a young merchant setting out in the 1970s, Mr. Zabar said, he allowed his imperiousness to define his business. He was obsessive about the quality of every piece of cheese and each bottle of oil. He learned to cook and bake so that all the prepared foods he sold were made either by his own hand or from his recipes. ""I only sold what I liked, and if you were offended, too bad,"" he said. ""I was offensive to many customers. I can't even believe some of the things I said."" He has mellowed somewhat. He can't quite exert the control he desires over his markets, except in his wine shop. ""I've gotten away from that; it didn't work in groceries,"" he said. ""But this wine store is a continuation of that attitude."" Indeed, he sells only wines he likes. He does not stock Bordeaux. ""I've never liked Bordeaux -- I never liked the cabernet grape,"" he said. He said he doesn't know enough about German wines to sell them, and carries wine from only one American producer, Hermann J. Wiemer of the Finger Lakes, because he loves the riesling.

His attachment to Burgundy, though, runs deep. He sees in the Burgundian vignerons the same obsessive concern with craft and quality that he felt as a young man. ""There was a part of me in each bread, each chicken salad I sold,"" he said. ""In Burgundy, they are invested in a way only somebody who works with their hands can be."" Though he knows what he likes, Mr. Zabar does not pretend to be a wine connoisseur. He often defers to his associates: Randall Restiano, his wine director, who handles buying wine for the restaurant and shop, and Jean-Emmanuel Simond, a wine importer and consultant in Paris, whom Mr. Zabar credits with a pivotal role in developing his taste. Every autumn since 2002, Mr. Zabar has traveled to Burgundy and the Piedmont with Mr. Simond, visiting producers and tasting obsessively. A longtime pilot, he flies his own jet, a Cessna Citation CJ4, to Europe and then meets up with a small group that currently includes Mr. Simond; Mr. Restiano; Dan Feldman, the sales director at the importer Skurnik Wines; and Johanne Killeen, a chef and owner at Al Forno in Providence, R.I., whom Mr. Zabar calls ""my wine wife."" He also tries to visit a new wine region each year with Mr. Simond. ""Eli is now being perceived by most top producers we visit not just as a collector, but as someone genuinely passionate, curious to learn every detail about their work and also their lives,"" Mr. Simond wrote in an email. ""And as someone who is doing something that very few people are still trying to achieve today in the wine world, aging the wines in his cellar for sometimes more than a decade before releasing them."" Aging wine properly is an obsession for Mr. Zabar. It's one of the reasons he stocks few grand cru Burgundies in his shop, because they need too much time. ""I want to sell village wines,"" he said. ""Others need time, and most people aren't going to age them."" The grand crus remain in his cellar until he feels they are ready for his restaurant list, often to be snapped up by the Burgundy lovers who monitor his offerings. Mr. Zabar came by his obsession with Burgundy in the early 1970s, when he owned a sandwich shop on Nantucket. After a summer season, he took a trip to France, with visits set up by a family friend, Michael Aaron, the proprietor at the time of the Sherry-Lehmann wine shop. He stopped in to see Louis Latour, the head of a venerable negociant house, who took him to a restaurant, Mr. Zabar recalled, redolent of truffles and veal stock.

""I've always responded to smells,"" he said. ""I thought, 'This is the only place I want to be.'"" And so it was with the wine. ""I found Burgundy so difficult, so curious,"" he said, ""and I loved the smells."" ""I think margins on wine should be reasonable,"" Mr. Zabar said. ""We'll make the money on the food we sell."" Alex Welsh for The New York Times Back in New York, he worked part time at Morrell & Company, a wine shop where another employee introduced him to his personal collection of grand cru Burgundies and impressed upon him the importance of proper aging. Mr. Zabar began to acquire a lot of wine but said he didn't start buying in earnest until 2002, when he opened the store and knew that he eventually wanted to open a restaurant. He buys directly from importers, and never from auctions."
53728,When Public Housing Is Across the Street,"Developers in New York City are building on land they might once have shunned, next to public housing developments.","Construction on One Manhattan Square, to rise next to the Rutgers Houses, a public housing development on the Lower East Side.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/28/realestate/28COVJP4/28COVJP4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=ee46ce7a179ccc21013828602eb1d2aadb607fa68afca2c95c36926af64fdff0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/realestate/when-public-housing-is-across-the-street.html,b6fd7bc9-61f4-5c32-b494-24f11cb1100a.jpg,"This spring, city officials announced they would encourage private developers to build on land inside public housing complexes, potentially making luxury apartments their neighbors. The city's move was intended to raise billions of dollars to fix up the often rundown complexes, and to expand the city's below-market-rate housing stock by requiring that 50 percent of such infill construction be set aside as affordable. But the economics of any new buildings will likely depend on also drawing market-rate tenants to places they once might have shunned. In many ways, the city is just playing catch-up. More than a half-dozen developers have already planted their stakes near public housing in places including Red Hook in Brooklyn, the Lower East Side of Manhattan and Mott Haven in the South Bronx. In the hopes of securing cheaper land in a city where lots at any price are growing scarce, they are ignoring taboos against living near public housing and venturing into areas once considered unprepossessing and even dangerous. ""They were isolated in the past, and a lot of that had to do with the perception of crime,"" said Keith Rubenstein, the managing principal of Somerset Partners, a development firm. ""That perception became more pronounced because there was so little interaction with these developments.""

That is ""an outdated way of thinking,"" said Mr. Rubenstein, who is planning a pair of market-rate developments by public housing developments in Mott Haven, a neighborhood where more than 14,000 people call public housing home. Public housing is certainly not crime-free. Certain complexes have slightly higher crime rates than their neighborhoods as a whole, police data shows. But crime rates are hovering near historic lows everywhere in the city, including at public housing developments, a trend that developers say is helping fuel their newfound interest. ""People who are living in lower-income housing are not necessarily people who are committing crimes,"" said Charles R. Bendit, the co-chief executive of Taconic Investment Partners, a development firm. ""And whatever stigma was attached to that is no longer valid. There's an income difference, and that's it."" Some developers say that negative perceptions of public housing have much to do with where it was put in the first place, on the outskirts of neighborhoods and in industrial areas. But even rough-and-tumble blocks are not so off-limits anymore.

The Adele, a 12-story building with studios and one- and two-bedroom apartments, filled up quickly, leasing all 135 units in just three months last summer, Mr. Kahen said. Market-rate studios in the building start at $2,400 a month. The building also has units with affordable rents. Next month, Sanba Partners is expected to start construction of 22 townhouses along King and Sullivan Streets, near Richards Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where factories and warehouses are plentiful. A half-block away are the Red Hook Houses, Brooklyn's largest public housing development, with more than 6,200 residents What to Know About Affordable Housing in New York A worsening crisis. New York City is in a dire housing crunch, exacerbated by the pandemic, that has made living in the city more expensive and increasingly out of reach for many people. Here is what to know: A longstanding shortage. While the city always seems to be building and expanding, experts say it is not fast enough to keep up with demand. Zoning restrictions, the cost of building and the ability by politicians to come up with a solution are among the barriers to increasing the supply of housing. Rising costs. The city regulates the rents of many apartments, but more than one-third of renters in the city are still severely rent-burdened, meaning they spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent, according to city data. Property owners say higher rents are necessary for them to deal with the growing burden of taxes and rising expenses for property maintenance. Public housing. Thousands of people are on waitlists for public housing in buildings overseen by the New York City Housing Authority. But the city's public housing system, the largest in the nation, has become an emblem of the deterioration of America's aging public housing stock and is desperately in need of a financial rescue. In search of solutions. Mayor Eric Adams has presented a plan to address New York City's housing crisis that includes expanding affordable housing through incentives for developers and preserving existing below-market units. But the mayor's critics say the budget still falls short of what is needed. Alessandro Zampedri, a managing partner at Sanba, said the townhouses, with contemporary facades of steel or terra-cotta, and with landscaped backyards, will fill in lots that had been empty and desolate for years. ""I think it's like everything in life, when you put something nicer in, that keeps within the context of what's there, I think it raises everyone's pride,"" he said. The townhouses, as yet unpriced, hit the market this fall. Developers say the amenities their buildings will bring to these newly targeted areas, such as stores, shoreline paths and improved streets, will benefit the neighborhoods as a whole.

Retail will be a major part of the larger of the two developments that Mr. Rubenstein of Somerset and his partner, the Chetrit Group, are planning in Mott Haven. The five-tower complex along the Harlem River will be two blocks from the 3,800-resident Mitchel Houses. The Adele, a mostly market-rate rental completed in 2014 on the Lower East Side, is a neighbor of the Lillian Wald Houses, right, a public housing development. Over all, the project, whose name will likely include ""piano district"" as a tribute to past manufacturing, will encompass 1,600 apartments, most rentals, and is to break ground early next year, he added. Mr. Rubenstein also plans to convert a former industrial building on nearby Third Avenue into a six-unit market-rate rental. That site faces Patterson Houses, a 15-building public housing development. But if new shops come in selling groceries, coffee and clothes that are too pricey for the lower-income residents of these areas, the upsides will be few, critics say. The average gross income of people living in public developments is about $23,000, according to the New York City Housing Authority, or Nycha. ""These will be luxury apartments. Imagine how that changes the economy of a community,"" said Victor J. Papa, the president and director of the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council, an affordable-housing landlord on the Lower East Side and a social services advocate. He fears shops that now serve residents may be replaced by merchants catering to the affluent. Mr. Papa, 70, who grew up in a tenement in the area, was referring to One Manhattan Square, which the Extell Development Company, the luxury apartment builder, is constructing at 250 South Street, by the Manhattan Bridge.

Bustling with construction equipment on a recent afternoon, the site is bordered to the north by the 1960s Rutgers Houses, five 20-story buildings with about 1,600 residents; on the eastern side is a high-rise Mr. Papa said is populated largely by formerly homeless families. One Manhattan Square, a working name, will feature two towers, one of which will stretch to 79 stories and contain condos, according to a plan filed with the city this month. Extell, which is perhaps best known for One57, the skyscraper that has broken sales records in Midtown, declined to comment. What has particularly upset residents is that to build One Manhattan Square, Extell bulldozed a Pathmark grocery store, at which time Pathmark's pharmacy also closed. The Adele may be at the forefront of a trend: private developers planting stakes near public housing complexes. Though Gary Barnett, Extell's president, said last year in a presentation to the community that the 45,000 square feet of retail space at One Manhattan Square will include a grocery and a pharmacy to replace what was lost, neighbors are skeptical, Mr. Papa said. There is also a sense of bewilderment that written-off areas may soon be hyped as cool. ""This kind of development would have been unthinkable,"" decades ago, Mr. Papa said. The area ""wouldn't have been good enough."" Whether wealthy buyers will decide to move to buildings cheek-by-jowl with public housing developments remains to be seen. But rubbing elbows with the locals is not necessarily in the cards, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm.

The kinds of upscale towers that are going up in once-blighted areas can function as gated communities in the sky, he said, giving residents plenty to do without having to set foot outside. In any case, Mr. Miller added, most condo buyers don't really care about location; height is what they pay for. Pricewise, ""there is less disparity between the least expensive and most expensive neighborhoods,"" he said, adding that ""the primary marketing vehicle is views."" But Mr. Miller added that Extell, which paid $104 million for the One Manhattan Square site in 2013, might be able to offer its condos at discounts relative to Midtown properties, perhaps in the $2,500-a-square-foot range, which could fill a major gap in the luxury market. Perhaps no public development will feel the brunt of new market-rate bedfellows as much as the Astoria Houses in the Hallets Point section of Queens. Occupying more than 32 acres, with 3,180 residents in 22 buildings, Astoria Houses sprawls across about half of Hallets Point, a nub of land in the East River facing the Upper East Side. Warehouses and fence-ringed parking lots for trucks seem to take up much of the rest of the sleepy area.

Durst isn't being shy about cozying up to its neighbor. Not only will the bulk of its towers sit across First Street from the Astoria Houses, but the developer also plans to build on land along the southern side of 27th Avenue that currently belongs to Astoria Houses and contains parking lots. Two affordable-only towers will go there, Durst said. Under the terms of the deal, the company would also build a supermarket, repair a waterfront promenade and make other neighborhood improvements. The other project, Astoria Cove, is to rise along what is now a wooded riverbank near Ninth Street, about a block from the Astoria Houses. There, in direct view of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, the Alma Realty Corporation says it will build a 2.2-million-square-foot mixed-use development with 1,700 units, of which 27 percent will be affordable, higher than the 20 percent customarily required. It, too, has promised a supermarket. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has made creating more affordable housing a centerpiece of his administration, received the larger amount of affordable housing in exchange for a zoning change. Alma principals were not available for comment. While outsiders for years may have been afraid of public housing, fear can cut both ways. The prospect of the two Durst developments does not sit well with some longtime residents, said Claudia Coger, the president of the Astoria Houses Tenants Organization. Ms. Coger, a retired train dispatcher, said that some worry about increased traffic and escalating costs, which is why she is pushing to make the Durst supermarket a community-owned cooperative. ""There are mixed emotions. This has been a blighted area for decades,"" said Ms. Coger, who has lived since 1955 in the same three-bedroom apartment, for which she pays $1,590 a month. Public housing rent is typically set at 30 percent of income.

Occasionally, there are tensions between the two groups. Caledonia residents have complained about Fulton Houses residents not picking up after their dogs and about loud music emanating from cars. On the other hand, Mr. Zollinger said he has heard Caledonia residents yell insults at Fulton Houses residents, including a memorable one from a Caledonia visitor: ""Why don't your parents go get a real job?"" "" 'Wow,' "" he recalls thinking, ""did you really just say that to a kid?"" But Miguel Acevedo, 55, who is president of the Fulton Houses Residents Association, and who has lived there on and off since he was born, said it's been mostly harmonious. ""We have the same lifestyle they have,"" he said. ""The only difference is their incomes are a lot higher."" And Caledonia residents regularly cut through Fulton's property without seeming fearful, he added. While many cities are razing public housing complexes, New York is trying to preserve its stock, a formidable task. According to Nycha, it has an operating deficit of $98 million, and its buildings, 270 of which are 30 years old or more, require a staggering $16 billion in deferred maintenance. Selling or leasing land inside public housing complexes for half market-rate, half affordable buildings is a major part of the mayor's plan. Up to four sites suitable for infill building by private developers will be identified by August, a spokeswoman for Nycha said. Developers will likely submit bids for them next year. Louis Brown has lived on both sides of the housing fence. Mr. Brown, 56, grew up in the Chelsea-Elliott Houses, on West 26th Street, and today lives in a one-bedroom at the Caledonia. For Mr. Brown, a retired youth counselor, it all comes down to the moments when he is deejaying in a courtyard at the Fulton Houses. On those days, residents from up and down the block, including from the Caledonia, come over and start dancing to his tunes. ""I look around and I think, Wow. I feel like we've come a long way."""
34578,Review: Taming 'The Taming of the Shrew' Under a Tent,"An hour north of New York City, a new production of Shakespeare's impossible comedy finds a sensible way to respond to the #MeToo moment.","Ms. Wisan plays the role of Kate, a woman protecting the slight freedom she has as a wealthy man's daughter.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/20/theater/20hudson-valley/20hudson-valley-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=f51eec7107d5f8be8cedfcaaeeaad592b35449e09490c3d13119f544353f0e46&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/theater/taming-of-the-shrew-hudson-valley-shakespeare-review.html,926eac24-898b-5c0a-b29e-ae273ee18b3d.jpg,"GARRISON, N.Y. -- When last we dropped in on Kate, Petruchio, Bianca and the gang, they were contestants in some kind of surreal beauty pageant, riding around on bikes and making no sense. That's what ""The Taming of the Shrew"" had come to in a 2016 Shakespeare in the Park production directed by Phyllida Lloyd. To be fair, those were end times for ""Shrew""; no one knew what to do anymore with a comedy that turns on the humiliation, torture and probable rape of an ""irksome brawling scold."" (In Anne Tyler's novel ""Vinegar Girl,"" released that same summer, Kate tames herself.) Ms. Lloyd evidently hoped that an all-female staging -- the men were played by women in drag -- would pluck the stinger from the wasp, to paraphrase Petruchio. Instead, the sweaty desperation of the effort exacerbated the problem and made it look intractable. Two summers later, with the #MeToo movement having exploded in the interim, it seemed time to say that ""Shrew,"" for all its perverse pleasures, should be left alone, in either of that phrase's meanings. Do it as written and live with it, or don't do it at all.

Not that its intent is so clear. ""Shrew"" is a shaggy, youthful play -- Shakespeare was still in his 20s when he wrote it -- and can be pruned into various shapes. In Ms. Cooper's staging, the topiary figures of a man and a woman that at times flank the dirt floor of the playing area, connecting it to the riverine flora beyond, suggest the shape she is after. For her, ""Shrew"" is a parable of discovery in which two misfits find, beneath the social construction of love, its natural contours. Aside from the usual heavy trimming, the director has taken only a few textual liberties to get there, mostly at the end. The infamous speech in which the tamed Kate says she is ""ashamed that women are so simple"" now finds her ashamed that ""people"" are. Otherwise, Ms. Cooper reorients the play through her psychological framing of the action. Like Waze for Shakespeare, she offers an alternative route through the usual terrain. The key to her interpretation is that Kate and Petruchio are (as she writes in a program note) ""radical souls."" Kate (Liz Wisan) is not a termagant for nothing; she is protecting the slight freedom she has as a wealthy man's daughter. Though instantly drawn to Petruchio, she's too smart to trust him, or even herself; hostility is not her flesh but her armor. Likewise Petruchio (Biko Eisen-Martin) is instantly drawn to Kate, not merely to her money. (When he calls her ""the prettiest Kate in Christendom"" he is not, for once, being sarcastic.) The ""taming,"" which is at first a sexy, mutual game and only becomes grim when he fears he is losing, is thus not a punishment but a test. Petruchio wants to know whether Kate can truly love him despite her natural defenses. He does not so much ask ""Will you obey me?"" as ""Will you soften your pride enough so that I can make you happy?""

And she, in essence, asks the same. Their common enemy is marriage as it is traditionally arranged in their time -- and, often enough, in ours. Ms. Cooper's production shows us exactly what this means in its treatment of younger sister Bianca (Britney Simpson), who cannot wed until her older sister does. The scene in which suitors vie for her hand by trying to top one another's financial offers is staged as an auction, complete with paddles. When Bianca does marry, even though it is to the suitor she most wanted, the girlish glee of independence drains from her at once.

What Kate models is thus not subservience to a man but a remaking of love through humility instead of humiliation. She no longer tells just wives to ""place your hands below your husband's foot,"" but all spouses of any gender to do so, beneath ""your partner's."" The taming must be mutual and voluntary; you have no doubt that, should Petruchio try to spank her again, she would walk off into the landscape -- as she does after their first encounter in this production -- with her middle finger aloft. That landscape does part of the work here. Like all of the festival's offerings, ""Shrew"" -- running in repertory with ""Richard II"" and ""The Heart of Robin Hood"" -- benefits from its environs. The awesome view through the semicircular tent openings of the Boscobel grounds, Constitution Marsh and the Hudson River beyond suffices for the eternalities; the production can afford to be more improvisatory, frolicsome and of our time. Ms. Cooper sees to that with a mostly young, eight-person cast, closer to the ages of the characters than we usually get. Ms. Wisan is an ideal Kate for this production, whip-stinging and whip-smart but deeply interested in men. And Mr. Eisen-Martin provides plenty to interest her, with his collegiate gamesmanship and boyish good looks, still slightly unformed. When love overtakes him unexpectedly you believe, as if for the first time, that he does what he does ""in reverend care of her."" These adjustments still can't answer all the problems that ""Shrew"" keeps raising. (Worse almost than starving Kate is Petruchio's coming late to the wedding she has finally decided to relish.) And Ms. Cooper's carnivalesque staging -- stuffed with comedy bits, golden oldies, pop culture references, cross-dressing, sprightly costumes (by Asta Hostetter) and the ""Kiss Me, Kate"" song ""Tom, Dick or Harry"" sung fetchingly by Bianca -- sometimes seems like it's trying too hard. Still, with the sky behind the actors slipping from pink to mauve to purple as the story itself grows darker, it's hard not to have rosy feelings about this ""Shrew."" It nearly makes you believe that within the same oldfangled men and women we've known for centuries, new people may really be ready to emerge."

10729,Hollywood Executive Ron Meyer Leaves NBCUniversal After Secret Settlement,A storied career that took him from teenage messenger to studio chief ends in a sudden resignation.,Ron Meyer's long Hollywood career apparently came to an end on Tuesday.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/18/business/18nbcu-meyer/18nbcu-meyer-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=27a92970c56f29d1f3541f59cec060de07ea9222e9f624fef76380492b2f275e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/business/media/ron-meyer-nbcuniversal-resign.html,99e7a0b6-c3c1-539f-90b6-39836e1abbce.jpg,"LOS ANGELES -- For four decades, even as other moguls came and went, Ron Meyer remained a Hollywood power player of the first order, a combination of amiable mayor and string-pulling godfather. But his career came to an apparent end on Tuesday in a way that has become numbingly routine in the entertainment business: He was ensnared in a tawdry scandal. Mr. Meyer, 75, stepped down from NBCUniversal, where he was lately the executive vice chairman, claiming he was the victim of an attempt to ""extort"" him that was related to a past extramarital affair. ""I recently disclosed to my family and the company that I made a settlement, under threat, with a woman outside the company who had made false accusations against me,"" Mr. Meyer said in a statement. He did not identify the woman. According to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private details, she is Charlotte Kirk, 28, a British actress. She was in the news last year, when her involvement with another Hollywood executive, Kevin Tsujihara, became public and led to his resignation from his job as the chairman of Warner Bros. Ms. Kirk had a sexual relationship with Mr. Tsujihara in 2013, around the time she was involved with Mr. Meyer. Ms. Kirk did not respond to a request for comment. Her manager, Shannon Pierce, asked whether payment in return for an interview with Ms. Kirk was possible. The New York Times does not pay for interviews.

In his statement, Mr. Meyer added: ""Admittedly, this is a woman I had a very brief and consensual affair with many years ago. I made this disclosure because other parties learned of the settlement and have continuously attempted to extort me into paying them money or else they intended to falsely implicate NBCUniversal, which had nothing to do with this matter, and to publish false allegations about me."" After the settlement, a male acquaintance of Ms. Kirk's had made the repeated requests for more money from Mr. Meyer, according to the people briefed on the matter. A police report does not appear to have been filed. Mr. Meyer led the Universal film studio from 1995 to 2013, when he was replaced by Jeff Shell, who was named the chief executive officer of NBCUniversal in January. Since 2013, Mr. Meyer had served the company as a kind of statesman. He had no daily role in the studio's movie operation and oversaw the company's unglamorous theme park business. But he maintained substantial influence in Hollywood, where he has deeper relationships than almost any other executive and people reverentially refer to him as Ronnie. Mr. Shell informed NBCUniversal employees of what he called the ""unfortunate news"" in an email on Tuesday.

""Late last week Ron Meyer informed NBCUniversal that he had acted in a manner which we believe is not consistent with our company policies or values,"" Mr. Shell wrote. ""Based on Ron's disclosure of these actions, we have mutually concluded that Ron should leave the company, effective immediately. We thank Ron for his 25 years of service, and for his significant contributions to NBCUniversal."" NBCUniversal decided to part ways with Mr. Meyer because he had settled with Ms. Kirk without informing anyone at the company, potentially exposing it to liability, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The settlement with Ms. Kirk took place a few years ago, long after their sexual relationship ended, these people said. What we consider before using anonymous sources.

Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. Last year, Mr. Tsujihara, the Warner Bros. executive who was involved with Ms. Kirk, stepped down from his job after The Hollywood Reporter revealed accusations that, at her request, he had pushed for her to be considered for film and television roles. Ms. Kirk's credits include bit parts in two Warner films: ""Ocean's 8,"" which was released in 2018, and ""How to Be Single,"" released in 2016. Mr. Tsujihara has denied having anything to do with her casting. It is unknown whether Ms. Kirk sought casting help from Mr. Meyer. Nothing on her resume was made by NBCUniversal. Mr. Meyer's exit is the second departure from NBCUniversal's executive ranks this month. Paul Telegdy, the chairman of its television entertainment division, was pushed out amid claims of workplace harassment. He is being investigated by outside counsel hired by NBCUniversal after accusations made by the actress Gabrielle Union and others that he fostered a toxic work environment, claims that he has denied. Mr. Meyer's resignation follows the downfalls of other powerful men in the entertainment industry that started in 2017, when investigations by The Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations that the film mogul Harvey Weinstein had sexually harassed and abused women for decades. Mr. Weinstein's film company swiftly imploded; he was convicted of sex crimes earlier this year and sentenced to 23 years in prison. In 2018, CBS ousted Leslie Moonves, who had led the network for 15 years, after The New Yorker reported that multiple women had accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Mr. Meyer had a storied Hollywood career. After dropping out of high school at 15, he joined the Marine Corps at 17 and started his movie career at 19 as a messenger for a Hollywood talent agency. After working at William Morris as a television agent, he went on to found the Creative Artists Agency with Michael S. Ovitz and Bill Haber. At CAA, Mr. Meyer represented stars like Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep. Over the years, he became known in Hollywood for an interest in high-stakes card games, a hobby that ultimately tormented him. ""Chronic gambling is an illness and has a lot of stupidity that goes along with it,"" Mr. Meyer told The Times in 2007. He said that he had given it up when G.E. acquired the bulk of Universal from the French conglomerate Vivendi in 2003. ""That made my decision for me,"" he said, alluding to the visibility and management rigor that ownership by the conglomerate would bring. Hired at Universal in 1995 by an earlier owner, Seagram, and its chairman, Edgar Bronfman Jr., Mr. Meyer was initially given the financing to match any competitor. But he squandered much of it on a string of flops that included ""Babe: Pig in the City,"" ""Meet Joe Black"" and a ""Psycho"" remake. ""I had huge financial support from Edgar and failed miserably,"" Mr. Meyer told The Times in 2007. Mr. Bronfman slashed the studio's production pool to $600 million, significantly less than what others were spending at a time when Warner Bros. was establishing its ""Harry Potter"" franchise and Sony had its ""Spider-Man"" series underway. The reduced spending meant smaller films, but ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Mummy"" did well enough to spawn franchises. ""King Kong,"" a rare big-budget bet in 2005, also became a winner. Other hits from Mr. Meyer's tenure included ""Erin Brockovich,"" ""Meet the Parents"" and ""The Fast and the Furious."" Unlike many moguls of his generation, Mr. Meyer championed female executives. He was a mentor to Donna Langley, promoting her through the ranks at Universal, where she is now chairman. Mr. Meyer previously helped groom Stacey Snider, who was the studio's chairman from 1999 to 2006 before she went on to run DreamWorks and 20th Century Fox. During his 18 years in charge, Mr. Meyer led Universal through four disruptive ownership changes. The company became the property of its current owner, the cable giant Comcast, in 2011. Mr. Meyer served as a liaison between Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia, and the Los Angeles entertainment industry. His longtime relationship with Steven Spielberg helped the company revive the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise in 2015, after more than a decade of dormancy."

Board diversity is often approached without taking into account the broader diversity of cultural organizations.

But my research on patronage at African-American museums suggests that attracting and retaining Black supporters at ""mainstream"" cultural institutions will depend on those organizations embracing a comprehensive agenda for change.

For example, during my interviews with Black supporters of African-American museums, it was common for patrons to share that they were attracted to supporting these institutions not only because of their focus on African-American artists, but also because of their outreach to African-American audiences and employment of a diverse staff.

This means that efforts to attract Black supporters to museums cannot be done in isolation. Instead, museums that want to increase board diversity will need to take a hard look at the diversity of their institutions as a whole."

They are worn by collectors searching for treasure: Hans Wegner club chairs, perfectly aged Levi's jeans (preferably from before 1971), and AC/DC and Wu Tang Clan concert T-shirts. Owners of vintage-clothing stores complain relentlessly about the deals being ""gone,"" yet they not only come back, but also scale the chain-link fence at the perimeter to get a head start before the gates open at 5 a.m. This is what Patrick Matamoros, a dealer who placed Kim Kardashian in a Sade shirt and Rihanna in a Whitney Houston one, did in August, shortly before he nearly came to blows with another vintage dealer. The immediate cause of their spat was a Black Crowes T-shirt, but the kerfuffle was years in the making.

""It just seemed so condescending,"" Mr. Matamoros said afterward. The argument escalated quickly. ""I called him a thief and a liar,"" Mr. Cole said. ""I said if he called me a thief again, bad things would happen,"" Mr. Matamoros said. Mr. Cole sneered at him and walked away. Once he saw the price tag, Mr. Matamoros turned regretful. ""It was $150,"" he said. ""It wasn't worth $50."" Still, he bought it from the seller. Partly because he felt responsible for destroying it. But mostly to spite Mr. Cole. ""I haven't had a chance to repair it yet,"" he said. All over the East Coast, flea markets are withering away. Buyers don't want to bundle up on winter mornings and scour for merchandise that can be found easily on eBay, Etsy or 1stdibs, with better guarantees. Sellers don't want to load pickup trucks with merchandise that can easily be sold online. Once frequented by Andy Warhol, Greta Garbo and Susan Sontag, the major weekly Manhattan flea markets in Chelsea began downsizing in 2005, after almost 30 years. The outpost inside the parking garage on West 25th Street closed in 2014.

""What's driving them is the desire to be cool and to have the next post on Instagram,"" Ms. Boes said, as she described how ""these kids"" scour through social-media posts, Goodwills and rag houses for rare finds. ""Then they wear it once or twice and sell it at the flea -- or over Instagram -- and buy something else."" The legalization of marijuana has also fortified the market, not simply because lots of dealers start getting high with one another at 6 a.m., but also because so many of the products being sold contain THC or refer to weed culture. Tristyn Rhoades, 29, is a self-described practicing witch who lives in the San Bernardino Valley with her husband and 3-year-old son. A year and a half ago, Ms. Rhoades turned her love of potions and spells into an apothecary business. During the week, she sells cannabis-oil-infused bath bombs over Etsy. On Saturdays, she brings them to the Silver Lake flea, sharing a booth with her friend Nicol Aiko, a 30-year-old jewelry designer who fashions gemstones into crescent moons, fairy and marijuana-leaf shapes. Ms. Rhoades is also among the 2,500 sellers paying about $100 for a booth at Rose Bowl, which for 50 years has taken place on the second Sunday of every month in the parking lots surrounding the 90,000-seat football stadium that the U.C.L.A. Bruins call home. The Rose Bowl flea was started by Richard Gary Canning, whose firm RG Canning Attractions began with concert promotion and car shows. The market was intended as a peripheral revenue stream.

In the 1970s and '80s, the Rose Bowl's biggest market was antiques, Mr. Redd said. In the early 2000s, the vintage-clothing market exploded and the Rose Bowl became a religious ritual for hoarder hipsters united in the desire to get baked and beat each other to Cross Colours jackets, Chanel handbags, Charlie Brown sweatshirts and other assorted pop-culture peculiarities. After rolling in before dawn, sellers use the next few hours to set up their stations and buy among themselves. Around 8 a.m., the Bowl becomes a street-style spectacular, as the bearded and tattooed rummage for Red Wing work boots amid collectors like Lisa Eisner, a jewelry designer and frequent companion to Tom Ford; the transgender actress Candis Cayne; and Brad Pitt, known among this crowd as much for his furniture expertise as for his movies. A few years back, Mr. Redd said, Mr. Pitt came in and spotted a chair he wanted. The seller was asking $600 for it. Mr. Pitt knew it was worth much more than that. So he pulled out a wad of cash and gave the seller a $2,000 bonus.

""Free O.J."" shirts from back when O.J. Simpson was on trial for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, abound. They usually trade for about $100 each, which is around what it costs to get an old R. Kelly shirt (not cheap for someone now infamous for alleged sex crimes). Nicholas Baier, a dreadlocked dealer at the Bowl, was shopping near his station and stumbled upon a shirt with a Confederate flag. He wasn't offended. ""I have Bill Cosby in my booth,"" he said with a shrug. ""It's history."" (Mr. Baier is white.) Recently, Mr. Matamoros has been buying up Russian Harley Davidson, Tower Records and McDonald's shirts. ""The potential for misinterpreting why someone is wearing a Russia shirt right now is awesome,"" he said. ""I want the shirts I sell to be political. I'm trying to say something."" Which is what, a reporter asked. ""Don't be boring!"" Mr. Matamoros said. Given how easy it is to search for concert tees on eBay, finding an authentic one from the Talking Heads 1983 tour for $50 has gotten increasingly unlikely. And shirts by Bell Biv Devoe and En Vogue cost a lot, the prices propelled by scarcity (most R&B and hip-hop acts from that time did not tour extensively) and surging demand from kids born in the '90s, who now have money, nostalgia and a desire to look like Kanye West, even as they make fun of his behavior.

The Oliphant brothers' wives are merely ""understanding,"" about their hobbies, according to Jeff, while Ms. Corbett has become an enthusiastic partner. After years of competing for customers at the Rose Bowl and bumping into one another at hobbyist events, the Corbetts and the Oliphants barely speak. ""It is what it is,"" Mr. Corbett said. And when Jeff Oliphant seemed particularly cheery on a recent summer morning, it didn't take long to figure out why. ""He's not here!"" Mr. Oliphant said, smiling brightly. Brian Cohen, a 44-year-old dealer who that morning was selling a rack of '50s-era harlequin print shirts, priced at $50 each, said: ""There could be an ensemble Christopher Guest movie based on the cast of characters at the Rose Bowl."" Mr. Cohen, wearing a retro flattop, as if he was the sidekick from a James Dean movie, wasn't being judgmental. In 2008, he plunked down $25,000 on a black crepe Hawaiian shirt with swirling tigers and bright red clouds. ""I only wore it once,"" he said. ""It's sitting in a bin with a bunch of other shirts, being enjoyed by no one.""

""There was so much action. I couldn't believe it,"" Mr. Cohen said. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles and took a monthly space at the Rose Bowl. ""The night before, I couldn't even fall asleep,"" he said. ""I was just so excited about all the things I could sell, all the things I could buy."" He had a Pavlovian response to the stench of vintage clothes wafting through the dry Pasadena air. And he was fascinated by the people: driven by a compulsion to acquire, yet seldom displaying any serious inclination toward power and wealth. Indeed, many were selling simply so they could keep collecting. ""The biggest thrill wasn't really making a profit,"" Mr. Cohen said. ""It was finding that new rare piece for the collection."" The Bowl's organizers also defy the conventional laws of capitalism, even as the business got more complicated in the internet age. ""We do not tell sellers how to run their businesses, and we take no cut from sales,"" Mr. Redd said

When customers arrive at the Rose Bowl on Sunday mornings, Mr. Cohen said, the first sentence out of their mouth has become, ""'Is that really your best price?' Even if they don't speak English, they know the word 'discount.'"" Although Mr. Cohen has kept his head above water -- in 2016, he even opened his own store, Vintage on Hollywood, in Los Feliz -- finding balance is tough. ""My romantic life has definitely suffered because of this,"" he said, describing dates during which he tried to put his phone away but couldn't help himself when it started buzzing and he realized there were incoming photographs of clothes he was interested in buying. Today, there are a lot more young women selling at the Bowl, and many sell in smartly designed tented booths with tribal rugs on the ground. But Mr. Cohen disdainfully calls them ""the Etsy girls"" and laments their effect on the Bowl: ""It became all about ambience."" Sean McEvoy, 37, who has sold vintage Sonic Youth T-shirts and highly collectible denim at the Bowl for a decade, has a wife, Rikki McEvoy, who runs his online business

Mr. McEvoy walked over to to a seller with a collection of Levi's and picked out six pairs he thought he could resell. But getting the price from $1,700 to $850 was brutal. ""I got to have a ciggie,"" Mr. McEvoy said at one point. ""I'm getting stressed out."" Even after Mr. McEvoy prevailed, he seemed unsure of whether he'd gotten a great deal or a big discount on a rip-off. Off in the distance, Mr. Matamoros was complaining about the cost of his shirts. ""Every month it gets harder,"" he said. Yet the bowl is his calling and his compulsion. He knows what would happen if it went away. ""I'd be homeless,"" he said."
11394,"Takeaways From Sarah Huckabee Sanders's Book: Kim Jong-un, Parenting, Trump","In her memoir, the former White House press secretary recounts being called out by Michelle Wolf, being asked to leave a restaurant, a wink from Kim Jong-un and more.","Sanders writes, ""One of the most frustrating parts of my job was cleaning up the mess.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/08/books/08Egan_Sanders/08Egan_Sanders-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=81938b662c3c1e0df1bbd2c19312f253346cd4f391b991071edf5e82bfb2f65e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/books/sarah-huckabee-sanders-book.html,8673292a-148d-5b06-99e4-5508025f7241.jpg,"""In the raging battle between the president and the media, I often felt like I was on the front lines in no-man's land,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders writes in her memoir, ""Speaking for Myself,"" which comes out on Tuesday. ""In one of my first briefings in my new role, I noted that I was the first mom to ever hold the job of White House press secretary, and said to my daughter, Scarlett, 'Don't listen to the critics. Fulfill your potential, because in America you still can.'""

""Speaking for Myself"" details how she came to heed her own advice when ""nothing was off-limits to the angriest Trump haters: my character, my weight and appearance, even my fitness to be a mother."" Sanders sometimes takes a granular approach -- sharing the logistics of a prank she pulled along with fellow seniors at Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., or describing chandeliers in the Arkansas governor's mansion, the back dining room off the Oval Office and at the Riyadh Ritz. Elsewhere, she writes about a wink from Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, and family visits to the White House, where the president once dropped ""an explosive f-bomb"" in front of her daughter.

Sanders briefly mentions several issues that roiled the United States during her time in the Trump administration: health care, the travel ban, race relations, mass shootings and family separation. Some only appear in the text of a satirical poem, written and read by Greg Clugston of Standard Radio at a holiday lunch hosted by White House correspondents in 2017. For example: ""In Charlottesville we witnessed long-simmering divides, / Trump drew fire citing 'fine people on both sides.'""

Here is what readers will learn from ""Speaking for Myself.""

Sanders describes how she felt when she was mocked by the comedian Michelle Wolf at the 2018 White House Correspondents Dinner and again the following summer, when she was asked to leave the Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Va. (In the six pages she devotes to this episode, Sanders never provides context for the ousting, which occurred in the midst of a national reckoning about the ethics of separating children from their parents at the border.)"
44417,"After Charlottesville, Even Dating Apps Are Cracking Down on Hate",OKCupid and other dating sites are the latest tech companies to ban extremists.,"Christopher Cantwell, who now faces charges over his actions at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., was banned for life from OKCupid, the dating site.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/24/us/00xp-okcupid/00xp-okcupid-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=184cfceaa6dd9220acc902caff6758960ee9c4e99b26b62c6ad299a271cc80d9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/technology/okcupid-christopher-cantwell.html,fa39745e-2aaf-5bce-8fc1-2dbd07e03f73.jpg,"The Silicon Valley companies that make money off social media and online services have started to enact strong measures against extremism, barring white nationalists, white supremacists, neo-Nazis and others who follow creeds they deem racist and hateful. Facebook and Twitter have developed tools to allow users to report hate speech and harassment. PayPal has blocked hate groups from using its financial services, and the ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft have urged drivers to report unacceptable customers. Airbnb took steps to stop white nationalists from renting rooms through its app before their gathering in Charlottesville, Va. Most remarkably, perhaps, the efforts have even spread to the free-wheeling world of dating apps, where users have for years been welcome to screen potential lovers based on everything from height to religious beliefs. The shift toward tighter regulation became especially clear after the Aug. 12 rally in Charlottesville led to violence. Days later, the dating site OKCupid announced on Twitter that it had banned a newly famous white nationalist.

Officials said a woman on OKCupid had watched a Vice News report on the violence in Charlottesville and recognized a man she saw on her screen as someone who had recently contacted her through the site. The man, Christopher Cantwell, had been prominently featured in the documentary endorsing violence and calling for an ""ethno-state."" In the days to come, he would surrender to the police on charges related to his alleged illegal use of tear gas during a torch-lit white supremacist march the night before the larger rally. But OKCupid officials said they already had enough evidence to ban Mr. Cantwell for life from the dating service. After being contacted by the user, they worked to verify that the man was indeed Mr. Cantwell, and on Aug. 17, the site tweeted, ""Within 10 minutes, we banned him for life.""

OKCupid officials then went a step further, urging site users to immediately report anyone ""involved in hate groups."" On the same day, another dating site, Bumble, announced it was also seeking to ban ""all forms of hate"" through a collaboration with the Anti-Defamation League. Bumble officials said they would look to the organization for guidance on identifying hate symbols and, like OKCupid, called on its users to block and report anyone they saw expressing hate. The moves are ""a consequence of the increased political polarity,"" said John Drew, an assistant professor of digital media at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y. He added, ""Some companies, especially ones that cater to younger, urban audiences -- like Bumble -- are no doubt considering the contemporary moment as a potential opportunity to cash in politically and win over users."" Dating apps have waded into a larger clash between Silicon Valley and the alt-right that seems to have escalated in recent months. OKCupid was just one of several internet companies to undertake a sweeping purge after Charlottesville, stepping briskly away from what experts said was a longstanding laissez-faire approach that helped some social networks develop the broad base of users they once needed to function. Earlier this month, Discord, a group chat app that was popular among far-right activists, banned several of the largest alt-right communities on it. Companies that offer hosting services, like GoDaddy and Google, have removed white nationalist and neo-Nazi sites. And after adding tools that allow users to report hateful messages, Twitter and Facebook have banned individual users who violated terms of service. Facebook has also banned a range of pages with names like ""Right Wing Death Squad"" and ""White Nationalists United.""

Indeed, even PayPal has joined the fray, electing to cut off the white nationalist Richard Spencer's organization. On his blog, Mr. Cantwell also complained about his PayPal account being shut down. ""Companies and C.E.O.s have an obligation -- maybe even a moral obligation -- to stand up for values,"" PayPal's chief executive Dan Schulman said in an interview with The New York Times. ""We have an acceptable use policy -- any site that promotes hatred, violence or racial intolerance, we shut down."" But experts warned that once online services start banning users because of their views, they risk tumbling down a slippery slope. OKCupid may have had several good reasons to ban Mr. Cantwell, said Jeremy Littau, an associate professor in the department of journalism and communication at Lehigh University. But ""once they start policing peoples' beliefs offline,"" he said, ""it's not unreasonable to ask why they allow people who have other beliefs or behaviors that are repugnant."" For his part, Mr. Cantwell complained in an interview before his arrest this week that in the days since the march and rally in Charlottesville, he had also been kicked off Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Match and Tinder. ""I can't even watch the Vice video on YouTube because it's age-restricted and I can't log in,"" Mr. Cantwell said. Spokeswomen for Facebook, Instagram, and Google (which owns YouTube) confirmed that Mr. Cantwell's profiles and channel were disabled because of hate speech. A Twitter spokeswoman would not comment on individual accounts, but said that the site's rules prohibit violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct. Officials with Tinder and Match, which like OKCupid are owned by Match Group , did not respond to emails. Mr. Seidman, the OKCupid C.E.O., said the need to remove Mr. Cantwell was clear and noted that the company's terms and conditions give officials full discretion to do so."
55138,"In West Chelsea, a Temporary Emporium",The sales office for a condo development is built from scratch and will be rented out after the building is sold out.,The glass-fronted sales office for a condo going up at 500 West 21st Street will be leased out after all the units sell.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/09/realestate/09POSTINGS1_SPAN/9-Posting1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=41a180916e88efcb41fba581e8210a02d7a36ff495201a0e721ba5092ae8e3c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/realestate/in-west-chelsea-a-temporary-emporium.html,d1a59e1f-a9eb-58a3-9c89-c7af9f40d625.jpg,"The sales offices that woo buyers while condominium projects are still clanging construction sites are generally tucked inside other structures, whether office towers, art galleries or storefronts. But in West Chelsea, in a bold and expensive effort, a sales office has been built from scratch. At 508 West 20th Street, next to the High Line park, the narrow single-story glass-fronted building is the place where brokers pitch 500 West 21st Street, a 32-unit condo that Sherwood Equities is developing around the corner. The office was built on the site of a failed condo project that cost Sherwood $7.3 million in 2011. The firm spent $1.7 million on the new building, which has 3,900 square feet of interior space and was designed by Mark Zeff. That price tag may seem indulgent for the marketing of just 32 homes, but Sherwood has longer-term plans. Once the condo sells out -- which at the current sales pace could happen by the fall, said Jeffrey Katz, Sherwood's chief executive -- the sales office, whose facade rolls up like a garage door, will be leased to an art gallery or a restaurant.

Some of its details are familiar: Buyers can mill around stage-set versions of future apartments and inspect stained white-oak kitchen cabinets and herringbone-pattern marble floors. But in a gesture that would be hard to replicate in a more typical retail space, Sherwood has created a soaring mural of trees across a 30-foot wall. This provides a glimpse of what the view would look like, full of birches and locusts, from a unit on a lower floor. That the wall makes its point like a billboard may not be surprising: Sherwood owns several buildings in Times Square that are hung with huge ads for M &M's, Samsung and Coca-Cola. Splashy head-turning visuals can work, said Mr. Katz, who added that buying based on pictures in a brochure seems to hold appeal only for investors. ""People who are buying to actually live there are a lot more careful,"" he said. ""Clearly a sales office that helps articulate what you're building is a big, big help.""

The condo units, most of which have two or three bedrooms, are priced at an average $2,500 a square foot. If a restaurant moves in after the sales office closes, it might be drawn to an aspect of the building not being deployed for condo sales: a 2,000-square-foot limestone-lined terrace, whose ringside-seat view of the High Line has few peers in the area. And as Ryan Nelson, Sherwood's senior vice president for development, pointed out, there aren't many places to sit down for a meal on the blocks between 10th and 11th Avenues, which the High Line runs through. (Mr. Nelson says Sherwood expects to generate about $800,000 a year in commercial rent.) But don't expect to be able to order a martini. Immediately next to the sales office, at 512 West 20th Street, is a Jehovah's Witnesses church, and state laws forbid the sale of hard liquor within 200 feet of a house of worship; only beer and wine are permitted. The sales building has already helped shape the neighborhood. Its location in a special zoning district called the High Line Transfer Corridor meant that its owner had the right to sell air rights to other developments in West Chelsea, and not just adjacent buildings, as is the case elsewhere. Realizing that projects were yearning for extra floors, Sherwood did exactly that, making $9.2 million in the process. Among the buyers was SR Capital, which paid $6 million for rights at 551 West 21st Street, a 44-unit condo it is developing near the West Side Highway."
10787,Uber and Lyft Just Can't Stop Flouting the Law,Both are threatening to pull out of California this week over a law requiring them to treat their workers as full-fledged employees.,A ride-share car in California. Lyft and Uber are fighting a state law that requires them to classify drivers as employees entitled to benefits.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/19/opinion/19bensinger1/19bensinger1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a8a9ac3bf3fcaa2cd8d8e42b8fc4d5d71aeb1e6fa90445f09a5599d9578ae903&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/opinion/uber-lyft-shutting-down-california.html,9d4153e4-e229-5e07-b6cc-7e7f2e3b65c2.jpg,"The ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft have long disingenuously insisted that they are not transportation companies. This is a legal strategy that, so far, has allowed them to label their legions of drivers contract workers, depriving them of company-backed benefits like health care, paid leave and severance pay. But as of Thursday, at least in California, Uber and Lyft may finally be able to state honestly they are not in the business of arranging rides. That's because they say they have no choice but to shutter operations in one of their largest markets after a state judge ordered them to comply with a new California law requiring them to reclassify contract drivers and grant them the benefits and protections afforded to regular employees. The companies argue that they don't have the ability to comply with the law by the deadline. Uber said it would need a year or more to rejigger its operations to comply. Unless a stay of the judge's order is granted, ""we would have no choice but to shut down ride-sharing in California, while we work to implement a dramatically different service than what hundreds of thousands of drivers have grown accustomed to or tell us that they want,"" said Noah Edwardsen, an Uber spokesman. While Uber is complaining that it hasn't had enough time, the writing was on the wall for Uber and Lyft in California more than two years ago, when the state's highest court created a new standard for classifying workers that strongly implicated gig companies. The new law effectively codifies that court ruling.

Last fall, Uber made changes to its app to give the appearance of more independence for drivers in anticipation of the state law's taking effect in January. Lyft and Uber spent millions lobbying against the law while simultaneously arguing that it doesn't apply to them because they are nothing more than digital marketplaces for connecting drivers with riders. In May, the state sued Uber and Lyft over their defiance of the law. This has not gone well for the companies. ""To state the obvious, drivers are central, not tangential, to Uber and Lyft's entire ride-hailing business,"" wrote Judge Ethan Schulman of California Superior Court, who last week gave the companies until Thursday to comply. If the companies' argument that they are just digital ""matchmakers"" were to stick, Judge Schulman wrote, ""the rapidly expanding majority of industries that rely heavily on technology could with impunity deprive legions of workers of the basic protections afforded to employees by state labor and employment laws."" This is not the first time Uber and Lyft have threatened to pull out of a market over legislation they oppose. Maryland legislators backed off a proposal to bolster background checks for gig workers with fingerprinting after Uber warned it would leave the state. And after a multimillion-dollar campaign led by Uber and Lyft against fingerprint background checks for drivers failed to sway voters in Austin, Texas, the companies left for a year until a state law was passed in their favor.

This time, however, Uber and Lyft are fighting with diminished leverage as the coronavirus pandemic and shelter-in-place orders have made ride-share volume nosedive. At one point in the fight against the California law, Uber's chief attorney unleashed a corker, arguing that ""drivers' work is outside the usual course of Uber's business."" Central to the ride-hailing companies' argument against the state law is that drivers would lose the flexibility they cherish -- the ability to log into the app when they choose to see if there is a desirable fare. But labor experts say Uber and Lyft could classify drivers as employees while still providing them flexible work schedules. ""There are countless companies that offer part-time work and a range of benefits based on how much you work,"" said William B. Gould IV, a Stanford University law professor and former National Labor Relations Board chairman. ""What these companies have created isn't innovation, it's exploitation."" Uber and Lyft note that in surveys, the majority of drivers say they prefer the contractor model. But this elides the fact that most drivers log just a few hours per week or per month, while a smaller group of full-time drivers account for the vast majority of rides and hours logged on the app. Those full-time workers are effectively employees without any of the benefits of being employees. The more compelling argument against the California law may be that the higher costs of paying for guaranteed wages and benefits will have to be passed along to passengers. But the truth is that these companies have trained customers to expect artificially low fares, and it's time riders dug deeper into their wallets to reflect the real cost of taking an Uber or a Lyft. This could be beneficial for the companies as well: By subsidizing the rides, Uber and Lyft have racked up billions in losses. They appear to be biding their time until ubiquitous self-driving cars mean they can eliminate drivers once and for all. And even under contract worker model, there is little evidence that Uber and Lyft have a sustainable business model. Together, they lost a staggering $11.1 billion last year and another $3.3 billion in this year's first quarter before the full force of the pandemic took hold. It's likely they would have to raise fares soon anyway.

In a New York Times Op-Ed essay this month, Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, argued that ""gig workers deserve better."" Indeed. But time and again, Uber's drivers have borne the brunt of the company's whims. For example, Uber doesn't pay into state unemployment funds for drivers, meaning the workers were reliant on federal assistance when the pandemic struck. And drivers have complained that the companies can cut off access to the app suddenly and without recourse, change fare structures and dictate precisely what routes to take. When drivers considered forming a union in Seattle, Uber bombarded them with anti-union messaging in the app. Now the two companies are weighing adopting a franchise model in California that would make them reliant on fleet operators to handle rides. Doing so would likely cut off thousands of drivers, The Times reported. Mr. Khosrowshahi says a third model of employment is necessary, where the companies could pay into a fund that drivers can use for health care or sick leave while remaining contractors. The notion, floated since California's law went into effect, will be considered by voters in a ballot measure in November. The measure appears to be a rollback of protections and benefits that drivers should be getting under the state law. The ride-hailing companies have been flouting that law since January, hoping for a bailout from the courts or from voters this fall. ""Saying this doesn't apply to them has no basis in law, and that's been backed up by the court,"" said Catherine Fisk, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ""If they cannot provide a business that complies with the law, they need to get out of that business.""

I go on learning from it myself. Part of its fascination is that its three parts -- ""Emeralds"" (to pieces by Faure), ""Rubies"" (to Stravinsky's Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra) and ""Diamonds"" (to the last four movements of Tchaikovsky's Third Symphony) -- are so unalike. ""Emeralds"" is Romantic-medievalist, French, seeming to occur in a large garden, deep glade or forest. ""Rubies"" is 20th-century American, indeed New York: merry, hard, dense, high-rise. ""Diamonds"" is imperial Russian, courtly. On Wednesday -- Balanchine's 110th birthday -- ""Jewels"" returned to the David H. Koch Theater with New York City Ballet, the company for which he created it. Just over 47 years after its premiere, its lead roles remain among ballet's most illustrious. This cast was led by nine senior principals: Ashley Bouder with Jared Angle and Sara Mearns with Jonathan Stafford in ""Emeralds""; Megan Fairchild, Joaquin De Luz and Teresa Reichlen in ""Rubies""; Maria Kowroski and Tyler Angle in ""Diamonds."" We can and should argue about aspects of their performances -- other troupes performing this ballet have sometimes matched or surpassed the current standards of this company (which offers other casts next week) -- but everything was intelligently focused, lucid, bold. Even some of City Ballet's hitherto more guarded performers just now seem to be communicating their love of dancing. It's infectious. They know this ballet intimately and made it newly engrossing.

Though the decor for the company's current production (by Peter Harvey, who also designed the 1967 premiere, with sets still used by the Mariinsky Ballet) is too broadly cartoonlike for my taste, I enjoy the way its gems carry different suggestions. In ""Emeralds"" I see dew hanging on garden cobwebs; in ""Rubies"" the bright lights of a city at night; in ""Diamonds"" snow suspended in a clear winter sky.

For some, all three are urban ballets: Paris, New York, St. Petersburg. And though the sets and Karinska's costumes strongly characterize each part, it's the choreography that most creates the three different worlds. In ""Rubies,"" dancers sometimes flex their feet, tread hard on their heels and thrust their hips in ways that would be unthinkable in the other two works. In the first ""Emeralds"" solo, a ballerina extends and withdraws her arms with a quality both crisp and perfumed that's exclusive to that piece. And the central sections of the grand ""Diamonds"" have a particular remoteness; its ballerina scarcely addresses the audience until the finale. Yet ""Jewels"" is one ballet rather than three. Certain images, steps and motifs bind its parts together. All three feature variations on the same grand port de bras, in which the female dancer moves from a concave shape to a convex one while she changes positions from one leaning forward with hands meeting, to a position outstretched with a bent back and arms open wide; all three show the ballerina revolving powerfully en attitude (her raised leg bent behind her), an orb whose facets catch the light differently as she turns. ""Emeralds"" and ""Diamonds"" feature a slow, weighted walk; in ""Rubies"" there is an irrepressible jog or trot. In all three parts, dancers stretch one leg and both arms up in various upward directions (forward, sideways or behind); to me these indicate aspects of the radiance of jewels.

And each has a central male-female pas de deux: ceremonious, harmonious, but also dramatic. At one point in each, the ballerina, while the man holds her, bends her head, spine and arms in a straight horizontal line; it's suddenly as if he's holding not a woman but a tense, magical creature, and there's a sense of an impasse in their relationship, as if, amid all their brilliant cooperation, she still resists him. The central role in ""Emeralds"" extends the shrewd, brilliant Ms. Bouder marvelously. She's a formidable virtuoso in many roles, but here you see her keen sense of atmosphere and nuance. Often the most knowing and least innocent principal dancer in New York, here she's deeply absorbed by a stage milieu larger than herself. Jared Angle, always a superlative partner, helped her sail beautifully through many lifts. Ms. Mearns, often so exuberant and vivid a dancer, is at her most beautifully aloof as the work's other ballerina; as with Ms. Bouder, her absorption deepens the ""Emeralds"" spell. Mr. Stafford, who retires this season and has had many injuries, danced stylishly and was her admirable partner. Ms. Fairchild, always a strong technician, danced the lead of ""Rubies"" with a twinkling confidence and percussive musicality that seemed to be personal breakthroughs. She still lacks eloquent line, upper-body plasticity and stage-filling amplitude, yet the way she took risks in covering space set high standards for Balanchinean impetus, and her lower-body sparkle was terrific. As her consort, Mr. De Luz exemplified the same virtues, with more than a touch of braggadocio. Meanwhile, the most definitive ""Jewels"" performance anywhere today is that of Ms. Reichlen as the female soloist. Sly and outrageous by turns, she hurled her beautiful legs up into the air with a power this company has seldom seen since Suzanne Farrell. You can watch all these women (Ashley Laracey was especially fine in the ""Emeralds"" pas de trois) and still gasp at the first sight of the spectacular Ms. Kowroski in her ""Diamonds"" tutu. She's the ultimate tall, slender, long-limbed ballerina, with feet and neck to match. And her persona is enthralling: she's both shy and imperious, combining elusive grandeur with tender surprise. What she often lacks is stamina, a full-throttle bravura technique and a fluent line that makes her legs and arms move in a single impulse. She has forged a bond with Tyler Angle -- like his brother Jared, a refined and redoubtable partner -- that is deepening her command of each ballet's poetry. Hers is a daunting role; on Wednesday you could feel and love her courage."

The action, which caused the country's stock market to close 2.4 percent lower, will make it harder for India to achieve the 9 percent growth target set by the government for the current financial year, which ends in March 2012.

The central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, acknowledged that concern but said it had to act to make sure the economy did not suffer long-term damage from rising prices; the central bank said it expected the economy to grow 8 percent, down from 8.6 percent in the previous year.

That slower growth will make it harder for India, the second-fastest-growing major economy in the world, behind China, to pull hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. And it will most likely worsen the Indian government's already large fiscal deficit."
54597,"In Each Child, an Inner Choreographer",Ellen Robbins's unusual classes encourage the very young to forge their own compositions by listening to their bodies and translating ideas into movement.,"The dance instructor Ellen Robbins, foreground with bobbed hair, and others watching Claire Judice perform.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/04/arts/04YOUNG1/04YOUNG1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=0c6cf94033b8c035fce94b64994c9ee62607d214a7749c1bd1a8dec62976839e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/arts/dance/in-each-child-an-inner-choreographer.html,6c3ccc0d-885c-58dd-b968-207165051f0d.jpg,"It's just after dark on a November afternoon in a dingy studio on West 14th Street. Ten girls and two boys, all 11, are putting together a dance inspired by space invader movies with their teacher, Ellen Robbins. Ms. Robbins switches on a CD of Edgar Varese's ""Arcana,"" an unruly snarl of blaring brass, dissonant strings and booming percussion, from 1927. ""Do you hear that crash of drums there?"" she asks. Several heads nod enthusiastically. ""That's when you'll start running."" She brings their attention to other buried elements in the score -- a pause, the introduction of an instrument -- and the children scatter across the floor and begin to create the dance. Ms. Robbins, a youthful 73, with a gray bob and purple sweats, lays the groundwork, goading them with descriptions that generate mental images. This is a dance class, but also a choreographic apprenticeship; the students are learning how to translate ideas and sounds into movement, how to tell a coherent story with their bodies. Ms. Robbins makes suggestions that mostly have to do with intention: ""The shape of your body, and not just your face, should reflect the energy of your astonishment,"" she says. The students immediately get her point; their bodies tremble, their muscles contract with effort.

Ms. Robbins has been teaching modern dance to children as young as 5 since the 1970s. She has a knack for tapping into the creativity of her students while painlessly introducing the rudiments of music theory and compositional structure through exercises that feel more like intricate games than like lessons. Even the 5-year-olds are given a chance to make up their own dances. By the time they are teenagers, they're composing multipart group works. Twice a year they put on a show, ""Dances by Very Young Choreographers,"" with costumes and music (of their own choosing) and professional lighting at New York Live Arts in Chelsea. The next one will be presented on Saturday and Sunday. For decades, Ms. Robbins was the educator in residence at Dance Theater Workshop before it merged with the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company to become New York Live Arts. Now independent, she circulates among several studios in Manhattan. Her students follow. ""I tell her, 'No matter where you go, we'll be there,'"" said Ronald Domingo, the father of Autumn, 11, who has been studying with Ms. Robbins since before her fifth birthday. (""We totally lied about her age,"" he admitted with a laugh.)

These aren't the only classes in New York that incorporate composition into their lesson plans. New York Theater Ballet holds intimate performances for which young people compose their own dances. Dance Adventure, an after-school program at Public School 3 in the West Village, produces site-specific dances around New York City. Still, classes that combine technique and composition are rare. What is clear, judging from conversations with Ms. Robbins's students, is how much such opportunities mean to them. ""It's amazing having someone who takes you seriously, even as a kid, and to know she trusts us,"" said one student, Emma Lee, 17, who started classes with Ms. Robbins at 9. She also pushes them gently to say something that matters to them. ""Her approach is really creative and helps you get your feelings out, and gives you a new view of the world around you,"" Claire Judice, 11, an intense redhead, said after class. This weekend Claire will perform a solo inspired by ""The Steam Man of the Prairies,"" an 1868 science-fiction dime novel that she discovered after coming across Steven Snowden's 2014 musical work of the same title on SoundCloud with her dad, a photo retoucher. ""And you don't have to do what she says,"" Autumn piped up. Autumn's solo, in which she flourishes a red cape sewn by her grandmother, evokes the theatrics and postures of the bullfight.

At a recent class for 16- and 17-year-olds, after some floor exercises accompanied on drum by Ms. Robbins, the young women began a sequence of plies, or leg bends. Instead of executing them in place, as they would in a conventional dance class, they did them while walking and running at various tempos across the room. Then they added turns. Their faces beamed. (""I do it this way so they don't get bored, but also to teach them about spacing,"" Ms. Robbins said as she watched.)

Near the end of class, the students did an improvisation to Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 8, one of the darker pieces in the classical repertory. It seemed like a challenging choice, loaded with pessimism and disappointment. Yet the students took to it with relish, responding to its moods, dynamics and jagged time structures. They formed canons, imitated one another's movements, supported one another in balances. It was thrilling to watch. Afterward, Ms. Lee talked about her coming solo, ""Wallflower,"" in which she repeatedly stumbles and pulls herself back up while wearing a party dress like a girl at the prom. ""I wanted to play with the idea of reluctance, to make it more internal than external, sort of pedestrian and human,"" she said. Ms. Lee is a smart, overcommitted New York teenager with many interests: soccer, track, drawing, photography, creative writing. She also attends a challenging school, Bard High School Early College, and will soon be applying to college. Ms. Robbins's classes have helped to shape her identity, she said: She wants to double-major in dance and ""some facet of the humanities."" Most of Ms. Robbins's students aren't virtuosos, although some, like Gia Taylor, 12, who studies ballet seriously, sings and attends the Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan, seem destined for the stage. But technique isn't really the point. ""I try to get them to understand their bodies as Mother Nature put them together,"" Ms. Robbins explained. There is a certain idealism to that approach, one that reflects the utopianism of early modern dance. She cites the modern-dance masters Mary Anthony, Erick Hawkins and Pearl Lang as influences. As a girl growing up in an artistic family in Yonkers, she studied with all of them. Her father, Bernard Robbins, was a violinist; her mother, Libby Robbins, studied the Isadora Duncan technique as a young woman, a free-flowing, ""natural"" style that was viewed as the opposite of ballet. After attending college and dancing for a few years, Ms. Robbins began teaching. A chance gig filling in for a friend was her introduction to working with children and led to a sort of epiphany."
9474,"Stay Safe, Justice Ginsburg",This summer has been hard enough.,Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in February.

The pandemic is raging, the economy is shuddering and the energy city's lifeblood, oil, while rebounding from a terrifying negative $37 a barrel in April, is still in the not-pretty $40 range. The state leadership is, at best, useless. Temperatures are averaging around 90 degrees with the ""feels like"" button on my weather app hitting 99 plus, due mostly to our Kolkata-rivaling humidity.

The prime months for hurricanes, August and September, are fast approaching. All the people who could leave town have done so, with flying tree roaches and mosquitoes taking their place.

It was in this atmosphere that I got the news last week that Ruth Bader Ginsburg's liver cancer had returned. It seemed like the rotten cherry on top of the bad-news sundae that has come to define life in America in the summer of 2020.

There's an obvious explanation for this: If illness forces Justice Ginsburg to step down in the next few months and President Trump gets to pick a replacement, it would strengthen the conservative wing of the Supreme Court for as far as the eye can see, despite some recent rulings that might suggest otherwise. (Yes, President Trump could also have that option and more after his possible re-election, but some things are just too painful to contemplate this summer.)"

Inside his office one day, the professor, Thomas Roma, removed her coat, lifted her shirt and pulled down her pants, she said. He put his mouth on her breast and placed her hand on his penis, she added -- behavior she described as consensual, overwhelming and ""controlled and initiated by him from beginning to end."" Afterward, Ms. Marno said, she heard that Mr. Roma -- a prominent photographer who teaches at Columbia University -- regularly pursued sexual relationships with students, and became uncomfortable when he made suggestive remarks after promising to act only as a mentor that semester. In January 2000, she made a written complaint to Columbia. But out of embarrassment, Ms. Marno said, she provided a watered-down account to the school's investigative panel. The panel determined that she and Mr. Roma were both complicit in the incident, she said, a decision that left her thinking Columbia ""should be ashamed of itself"" for not investigating Mr. Roma more thoroughly.

Ms. Marno, now an actress with credits on ""House of Cards"" and ""The Blacklist,"" is one of five women who spoke on the record with The New York Times to describe sexual misconduct by Mr. Roma, the director of the photography program at Columbia's School of the Arts and a documentary photographer whose work is owned by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago and other museums. The Times also interviewed people with whom the women discussed Mr. Roma's behavior at the time of those events or later. The accusations depict behavior said to have occurred mostly in the 1990s and that followed a similar pattern: Mr. Roma started relationships with young women he taught at Columbia and at the School of Visual Arts, flattering and cajoling them, making sexual advances -- and, one woman said, placing his penis in her mouth. He would also often remind them of his professional stature, the women said. That stature carries considerable influence, beyond the usual power disparity between professor and student: In the field of photography, Mr. Roma could make a difference by providing letters of reference, recommendations for grants, and introductions to art dealers and collectors.

Mr. Roma, provided with details about the accounts of the women, declined to be interviewed. His lawyer told The Times that Mr. Roma disputes any suggestion that his behavior was ever coercive and that the professor had cooperated fully with Columbia's inquiry into Ms. Marno's complaint. The lawyer, Douglas Jacobs, issued a statement saying that Mr. Roma was ""shocked"" by the accusations from the other four women. ""The statements they are making about his asserted misconduct are replete with inaccuracies and falsehoods,"" Mr. Jacobs said. ""All four have taken isolated, innocent incidents, none of them predatory, and have created fictitious versions of reality that are libelous and in the present political climate designed to damage his career and his personal life. Professor Roma's sympathies then and now lie with those who have been mistreated in any way and he completely fails to understand why these women have chosen to create these complaints two decades after the alleged facts supposedly occurred."" Four of the five women attended the School of Visual Arts around the same time; some were friends there and have stayed close. Joyce Kaye, a spokeswoman for S.V.A., said the school ""does not have a record of any complaints against Mr. Roma"" when he taught there in the 1980s and '90s. Suzanne Goldberg, Columbia's executive vice president for university life, said in response to the accusations against Mr. Roma: ""It is our standard practice to investigate whenever we receive a report that a faculty member may have sexually harassed a student.""

Ms. Goldberg said that university policy forbids faculty members from having sexual relationships with students they oversee. Columbia, like many schools, has been trying to navigate ongoing campus debates about how best to handle student allegations of sexual misconduct. Ms. Goldberg said Columbia ""looks differently at these matters today than 20 years ago"" when Ms. Marno filed her complaint. ""Our policies on faculty conduct have been strengthened accordingly in recent years,"" she said. In December, William V. Harris, a professor of Greco-Roman history, retired after accusations that he had harassed three students. Mr. Roma, whose best known work includes black-and-white images of worshipers in African-American churches and portraits of people at the Brooklyn criminal courthouse, has received two Guggenheim fellowships and had solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the International Center of Photography. He is married to a daughter of Lee Friedlander, a giant in the world of documentary photography, and has published 15 monographs with introductions by writers like Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Norman Mailer. His teaching career includes stints at Fordham, Cooper Union and Yale, according to his website.

The five women described Mr. Roma as a charming and charismatic teacher who cultivated a streetwise persona and emphasized perseverance, sacrifice and dedication to craft. The women, as well as some former students who posted anonymously online about Mr. Roma's teaching, said that he could be an unsparing critic, but also had the ability to instill confidence and inspire. One of the women, Ash Thayer, a filmmaker and artist in Los Angeles, said she studied with Mr. Roma in the mid-1990s at S.V.A., then in the graduate program at Columbia, where she was also his teaching assistant. In 1999, Ms. Thayer said, she was working in Mr. Roma's office at Columbia shortly after a mutual friend, the photographer Raghubir Singh, had died. Ms. Thayer said that she was sitting at a desk when Mr. Roma asked her to turn around. His penis was erect, she said, and he moved toward her. She repeatedly said ""no,"" but Mr. Roma placed his penis in her mouth before she pushed him away and left, Ms. Thayer said, estimating that the encounter lasted perhaps 30 seconds. ""I froze,"" she said. ""He committed oral rape against me."" Allison Ward, a student at S.V.A. in the mid-1990s, said she had several sexual encounters with Mr. Roma. One occurred in a classroom, she said, recalling that she ""was mortified and embarrassed but went along with it."" Ms. Ward said that she had wanted to please Mr. Roma and gain his acceptance, adding ""he was the first person in my life who had connected my passion for photography with a path forward."" Mr. Roma did not force any contact, she said, but had been ""predatory"" and had ""crossed a line"" by seeking a sexual relationship.

""He was coercive and would keep trying,"" she said. ""He was a little relentless."" Another S.V.A. student in the mid-90s, Angela Cappetta, said that after repeated requests she allowed Mr. Roma to photograph her in her apartment. There, she said, Mr. Roma asked to touch her breast and put her hand on his crotch. ""I thought I'd have to go along with it or it would be detrimental,"" she said. She drew the line when he asked to have sex, she added. On campus, Mr. Roma often surrounded himself with a coterie of male and female students who would sort his negatives and act as teaching assistants, the five women said, adding that Mr. Roma would regularly invite students on outings or to gatherings at his house in Park Slope. In 1997, Ilana Rein, a graduate student at S.V.A., said that Mr. Roma, who was then her thesis adviser, invited her to a backyard gathering. He asked her into his photo studio, then bluntly stated that he needed something from her and placed her hand on his crotch, Ms. Rein said. Taken aback, she did not object, but soon began feeling ill, removed her hand and left. ""I was blindsided because I thought we were going to look at photographs,"" Ms. Rein, now a filmmaker in Los Angeles, said. ""This is someone who I trusted."" Some of the former students stayed in touch with Mr. Roma after these encounters, saying that they were intimidated, sought his help or wanted to believe that his behavior had been out of character. But, some added, Mr. Roma could be dismissive or even cruel to those who had rebuffed him. Ms. Rein said that during a trip to Coney Island with students after her encounter with Mr. Roma, he repeatedly singled her out for mockery, while others laughed. ""There was a kind of violence to it,"" she said. ""He had such a vise grip on us back then.""

Ms. Thayer said she blocked out memories of the office incident and, after graduating, remained in sporadic touch with Mr. Roma, exchanging emails and sometimes asking for recommendations or advice. In 2014, she said, she met Mr. Roma in Brooklyn and let him know that a book of her photographs was about to be published. He told her he might be able to help her get a teaching job at Columbia, Ms. Thayer said, but then implied that he would expect intimate contact in return. She has not seen or spoken with Mr. Roma since. ""I just kept wanting him to be the mentor that he was supposed to be,"" Ms. Thayer said. ""But I realized that there was not going to be a time when he was not inappropriate with me and asking for a sexual relationship."""
17674,Ancient European Stone Monuments Said to Originate in Northwest France,Research on Stone Age tombs throughout Europe offers a new answer to an old debate on where and when the iconic stone works were first built.,"The Dolmen di Sa Coveccada, an ancient megalithic grave, in Sardinia, Italy.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/12/science/09TB-TOMB1/09TB-TOMB1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=e15ee0f331da522e0955268b77d8bc15b2b1482c87327f011538a782b6111586&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/science/megaliths-archaeology-tombs.html,0ddc2816-af61-5d69-943d-cf5dcf36326a.jpg,"Thousands of years ago, megaliths began to appear in Europe -- standing stones, dolmens, stone circles. They vary from single stones to complexes like Stonehenge. There are about 35,000 such monuments in Europe, many along the Atlantic coast of France and Spain, in England, Ireland, Scandinavia and throughout the Mediterranean. They attract both tourists and archaeologists, who have spent a century debating how the knowledge to build such monuments spread. One idea suggested that this cultural change came from the Near East, and spread west along coastal routes, perhaps by a priestly caste. Later theories suggested techniques may have developed independently in different locales. But a scientist who analyzed 2,410 radiocarbon dates of megaliths and their surroundings reported on Monday that the first such tombs appeared in France, about 6,500 years ago, and then spread along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, as well as to England, Ireland and Scandinavia.

""It took me 10 years of my life for this research,"" said the scientist, Bettina Schulz Paulsson, a prehistoric archaeologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. She combed the literature in 11 languages, assessed the validity of the dating tests, and used a statistical method called Bayesian analysis to narrow the dates further. She reported her findings in the journal PNAS, concluding that the building of megalithic graves appeared and spread along the coast of France, Spain and Portugal and the Mediterranean within a period of 200 to 300 years.

Kristian Kristiansen, also at Gothenburg University but not involved in Dr. Schulz Paulsson's study, said the research was ""a real breakthrough,"" providing for the first time both the origin and the evidence for a coastal, maritime spread of the technology. That, in itself is significant because it suggests that people of the time had boats and skill to travel along the coasts and quickly spread the megalithic method.

Dr. Schulz Paulsson found that the oldest megalithic graves dated from about 4800 to 4000 B.C. in northwest France and other areas like the Channel Islands, Corsica and Sardinia. But northwest France is the only one of these areas that showed evidence of earthen grave monuments that preceded the first megaliths, dating back to around 5000 B.C. These graves, in the geological area known as the Paris basin, indicate the beginnings of monument building that are lacking in the other areas.

Dr. Schulz Paulsson said that the earliest standing stones in Brittany were some of the largest. An early stone called the Grand Menhir, once rose more than 20 meters high. Some of the early monuments were dolmens, tablelike structures that look like the Greek letter Pi. Around 4300 B.C., she wrote, the builders made dolmens that could be re-opened, for additional burials. The earliest is in Prisse-la-Charriere in central western France, constructed between 4371 and 4263 B.C. There were also subsequent waves of megalith construction, she said. One between 3500 and 4000 B.C. involved passage graves, which have a corridor and allow for multiple burials.

She also found a ""megalithic revival"" in Sicily, Apulia and the Balearic Islands, which include Mallorca and Ibiza, in the second millennium (2000 to 1000 B.C.). Some of the more famous and elaborate megaliths, like Stonehenge, came near the end of the construction of megalithic monuments, around 2500 B.C.

Dr. Kristiansen said that ""an added bonus"" of the work is that, ""This matches the most recent genetic evidence we have. Recent ancient DNA results show that people in Ireland and England came from Iberia."" He said the construction of the megaliths, particularly the passage tombs, was quite complex. He said researchers had even found tombs that seemed to bear a signature design in Denmark and in northern Germany. He said there were some missing dates for Near Eastern megaliths that could possibly complicate the picture, but that he found the evidence Dr. Schulz Paulsson marshaled clear and persuasive. ""This is definite. It is a maritime diffusion."" Dr. Schulz Paulsson said that future research will focus on the trading of greenstone along the route she traced for the expansion of the tomb technology. Greenstone trading is known to have occurred in the Stone Age, but she thinks the maritime trading along that route was more advanced than previously thought, and maritime technology more sophisticated, too. She also hopes to do carbon-dating and more field work. Over the past decade, she said, she had dragged her family with her on research trips. Of course, she acknowledged, much of that travel was along the Atlantic coast of France and to the various Mediterranean coastal sites. ""It's not the worst,"" she said."

44165,"A Cancer Conundrum: Too Many Drug Trials, Too Few Patients",Breakthroughs in immunotherapy and a rush to develop profitable new treatments have brought a crush of clinical trials scrambling for patients.,"Bruce Fenstermacher, 67, a retired truck driver who is taking part in a clinical trial of an experimental drug.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/29/science/00CANCERTRIALS-promo/00CANCERTRIALS-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=3c5862bcc336f8a69a4e19babaa7a06d6a9a6301cb6d9d1cd08a71a75e694bb5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/health/cancer-drug-trials-encounter-a-problem-too-few-patients.html,14747a74-80c3-5eb9-9887-a5d49d03c5fa.jpg,"A Cancer Conundrum: Too Many Drug Trials, Too Few Patients

With the arrival of two revolutionary treatment strategies, immunotherapy and personalized medicine, cancer researchers have found new hope -- and a problem that is perhaps unprecedented in medical research. There are too many experimental cancer drugs in too many clinical trials, and not enough patients to test them on. The logjam is caused partly by companies hoping to rush profitable new cancer drugs to market, and partly by the nature of these therapies, which can be spectacularly effective but only in select patients. In July, an expert panel of the Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of a groundbreaking new leukemia treatment, a type of immunotherapy. Companies are scrambling to develop other drugs based on using the immune system itself to attack cancers.

Many of these experimental candidates in trials are quite similar. Yet each drug company wants to have its own proprietary version, seeing a potential windfall if it receives F.D.A. approval. As a result, there are more than 1,000 immunotherapy trials underway, and the number keeps growing. ""It's hard to imagine we can support more than 1,000 studies,"" said Dr. Daniel Chen, a vice president at Genentech, a biotechnology company. In a commentary in the journal Nature, he and Ira Mellman, also a vice president at the company, wrote that the proliferating trials ""have outstripped our progress in understanding the basic underlying science."" ""I think there is a lot of exuberant rush to market,"" said Dr. Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""And we are squandering our most precious resource -- patients.""

Most melanomas are cured by surgery, leaving about 10,000 patients who have had relapses and could be candidates for an experimental treatment. But nearly all will be treated by doctors outside of academic medical centers, who are not part of the clinical trials network and so do not offer patients experimental treatments. Progress in the field. In recent years, advancements in research have changed the way cancer is treated. Here are some recent updates: Uterine cancer. Women who use chemical hair straighteners frequently could have a higher risk of developing uterine cancer than women who have never used the products, according to new findings from a national study that has followed nearly 34,000 U.S. women for more than a decade. Breast cancer. A new study suggests surgery may not always be necessary for all breast cancer patients. A small early-stage clinical trial found that a carefully selected group of patients who responded remarkably well to chemotherapy could skip surgery altogether. Cancer vaccines. For a long time, the promise of cancer vaccines that would protect healthy people at high risk of cancer has only dangled in front of researchers. Now, though, encouraging animal data and preliminary studies in human patients are making some doctors feel optimistic. Rectal cancer. A small trial that saw 18 rectal cancer patients taking the same drug, dostarlimab, appears to have produced an astonishing result: The cancer vanished in every single participant. Experts believe that this study is the first in history to have achieved such results. Companies therefore must compete for the few patients with relapsed melanoma who are at centers offering clinical trials. Many end up struggling to find enough subjects to determine whether a treatment actually works -- and if so, for whom. And these drugs often are not so different from one another. Immunotherapy drugs that attack a protein known as PD-1 are approved for treatment of lung cancer, renal cell cancer, bladder cancer and Hodgkin's disease, noted Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the F.D.A.'s Oncology Center of Excellence. Yet many pharmaceutical companies want their own anti-PD-1. Companies are hoping to combine immunotherapy drugs with other cancer drugs for added effect, and many do not want to have to rely on a competitor's anti-PD-1 drug along with their own secondary drugs. So in new trials, additional anti-PD-1 drugs are being tested all over again against the same cancers -- a me-too business strategy taken to multibillion-dollar extremes. ""How many PD-1 antibodies does Planet Earth need?"" wondered Dr. Roy Baynes, a senior vice president at Merck, which received approval for its first such drug in 2014.

Immunotherapy trials have proliferated so quickly that major medical centers are declining to furnish patients to them. The Yale Cancer Center participates in fewer than 10 percent of the immunotherapy trials it is asked to join. The problem is that many of the trials are uninteresting from a scientific view, said Dr. Roy Herbst, the center's chief of medical oncology. The companies sponsoring these trials are not addressing new research questions, he said; they are trying to get proprietary drugs approved. If the struggle to find patients for immunotherapy trials is challenging, finding patients for another new type of cancer treatment can be next to impossible.

These are drugs that attack mutations that tumors need to grow and thrive -- so-called targeted therapies. The idea is that tumors can be reliant on certain gene mutations. Block those mutations and the tumors will die. The problem is that the mutations can be extraordinarily rare. Most patients who have cancers with the mutation in question have no idea; to find them, large groups of cancer patients must have their tumors genetically tested. That's expensive: Genetic sequencing costs about $5,000, and insurers rarely pay. Most cancer patients treated outside of academic centers do not have their tumors sequenced.

So what to do if you're a company with a drug that seems to be dramatically effective, but only in a few patients? You may be forced to undertake a worldwide search for subjects that can last for years. To test a two-drug combination against lung cancer, GlaxoSmithKline searched the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe for 13 months just to find 59 patients whose tumors shared a rare mutation. It took Pfizer three years to locate 50 lung cancer patients who carried a rare aberration called ROS1, found in just 1 percent of patients. Clinical trials with patient searches like these are ""not for the faint of heart,"" said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, a senior vice president at Pfizer. It helps that the F.D.A. has not insisted on large trials with control groups in instances of targeted therapies with few who qualify. Instead the agency is looking for drugs with effects so powerful there is no question that they work -- studies in which patients went into remission, for example, when all evidence suggested they would die.

""We used to have trials not long ago that had 700 patients per arm,"" Dr. Sharpless said, referring to the treatment groups in a study. ""That's almost undoable now."" Today, ""trials can be eight patients."" To test a drug that attacks a tumor with a mutation found in just 1 percent of cancer patients, researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering fanned out to the nonacademic medical centers where the majority of patients are treated, offering to pay for most of the cost of genetic testing, seeking patients at practices in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania; Hartford, Conn.; and Miami. That is how Bruce Fenstermacher, 67, a retired long-distance truck driver who lives in Allentown, Pa., discovered he had the rare mutation that the drug's manufacturer, Loxo Oncology, had been looking for. He had been receiving immunotherapy for his melanoma, but it had stopped working and his cancer was spreading again. Discovering that mutation was like hitting the jackpot for Mr. Fenstermacher, said Dr. Suresh Nair, an oncologist with Lehigh Valley Health Network. The experimental drug seems to be working for Mr. Fenstermacher. But since so few patients have tumors that might respond, oncologists wonder how they will find them. Is it worth it? Is it even possible? ""If, God forbid, I had a family member with cancer, I would insist on this type of testing,"" said Dr. David Hyman, chief of the Early Drug Development Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""But I don't know what the rate has to be for society to say, 'We can't afford to miss these people.'"" And trials involving limited numbers of patients can be perilous. The smaller the study and the shorter its duration, the more likely that what looks like an effect in a trial might simply be a result of chance, Dr. Bach of Memorial Sloan Kettering said.

""That leaves some of us evidence geeks wondering if it works,"" he said. Some of the new cancer drugs have had such impressive results that their effectiveness was not in doubt, said Dr. Vinay Prasad, an oncologist at Oregon Health and Sciences University. But, there also were drugs approved without control groups that did not provide such stunning benefits, and others that markedly slowed the growth of tumors but did not extend life. In tiny studies, serious side effects can be missed, said Dr. Scott Ramsey, an oncologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. He worries about the expense of the new drugs, including out-of-pocket costs to patients. They may want the new cancer drugs reaching the market, he said, ""but you wonder if you are doing them any favors."""

TINA JORDAN Tell me how you met. I hear it's a great story.

DOUGLAS PRESTON In my first job out of college, I worked at the American Museum in New York, where I wrote a column for Natural History magazine on the museum. Linc had been reading it and he called me up. He identified himself as an editor at St. Martin's and asked if I'd care to discuss a book about the museum over lunch at the Russian Tea Room. I was terribly impressed and rushed to Goodwill to get myself a jacket so I could get into the restaurant. When I arrived, instead of the distinguished editor I expected to find, here was this kid younger than I was. That book became ""Dinosaurs in the Attic.""

LINCOLN CHILD In that meeting we learned, among other things, that we shared a love for blinis au caviar. It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

JORDAN How did your first book come about?

PRESTON After ""Dinosaurs in the Attic"" was published, I gave Linc an evening tour of the museum. We ended up in the Hall of Late Dinosaurs, the great black skeletons looming over our heads, casting crazy shadows. He turned to me and said, ""This is the scariest damn building in New York City. We've got to write a thriller set in a museum like this."" And that became ""Relic,"" our first Preston & Child novel."

2811,"Coronavirus May Have Spread in U.S. for Weeks, Gene Sequencing Suggests","Two cases detected weeks apart in Washington State had genetic links, suggesting that many more people in the area may be infected.","The first death in the United States from the coronavirus outbreak occurred at EvergreenHealth Medical Center in Kirkland, Wash. on Saturday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/01/us/politics/01virus-spread/01virus-spread-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=514b734af41f7263a96c8b95485abff0fcab5cf2e21a7375c1ee2e67e9322f6e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/health/coronavirus-washington-spread.html,50231463-3e51-5170-ab4a-507ed9f003d1.jpg,"Researchers who have examined the genomes of two coronavirus infections in Washington State say the similarities between the cases suggest that the virus may have been spreading in the state for weeks. Washington had the United States' first confirmed case of coronavirus, announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jan. 20. Based on an analysis of the virus's genetic sequence, another case that surfaced in the state and was announced on Friday probably was descended from that first case. The two people live in the same county, but are not known to have had contact with one another, and the second case occurred well after the first would no longer be expected to be contagious. So the genetic findings suggest that the virus has been spreading through other people in the community for close to six weeks, according to one of the scientists who compared the sequences, Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington. Dr. Bedford said it was possible that the two cases could be unrelated, and had been introduced separately into the United States. But he said that was unlikely, however, because in both cases the virus contained a genetic variation that appears to be rare -- it was found in only two of the 59 samples whose sequences have been shared from China, where the virus originated.

A scientist who was not involved in the analysis said he agreed with the conclusion that the second case was connected to the original Washington case. ""I think he's right,"" said Andrew Rambaut, professor of molecular evolution at the University of Edinburgh, referring to Dr. Bedford. ""It's extremely unlikely that two viruses coming from outside the U.S.A. independently would arrive in the same geographical area and be genetically related unless they were connected."" State and local health officials have been hamstrung in their ability to test widely for the coronavirus. Until very recently, the C.D.C. had insisted that only its test could be used, and only on patients who met specific criteria -- those who had traveled to China within 14 days of developing symptoms or had contact with a known coronavirus case. If the virus has been spreading undetected in Washington since mid-January, that could mean that anywhere from 150 to 1,500 people may have it, with about 300 to 500 people the most likely range, said Dr. Mike Famulare, a principal research scientist at the Institute for Disease Modeling in Bellevue, Wa., who performed the analysis. These people ""have either been infected and recovered, or currently are infected now,"" he said. Many of those people would now be in the early stages of incubating the virus, and might not yet be contagious, Dr. Famulare said. Dr. Famulare's estimate was based on a simulation using what scientists have learned about the incubation period and transmissibility of the virus. He called his figures a ""best guess, with broad uncertainty."" Another method, based on the size of the local population, the number of tests performed and the proportion of those that were positive, produced similar estimates of how widely the virus may have spread in the community.

The scientists immediately reported the genomic sequence and their findings to state and federal health officials. Dr. Scott Lindquist, the state epidemiologist for communicable diseases with the Washington State Department of Health, said on Sunday that though Dr. Bedford's laboratory had ""very limited"" data to work with, ""I would not be surprised if there was transmission and these two were related."" Dr. Lindquist said more would be known when genetic sequences from the state's other cases have been similarly analyzed. ""Seeing how they all relate to each other will be the real answer to the question of, has it been circulating,"" he said. ""I imagine within the week we should have some of these answers."" Heather Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Snohomish Health District, said in a statement that the district was aware of the preliminary findings suggesting that coronavirus had been spreading for close to six weeks. She said that it was important to remember that national testing capabilities have only been available for about six weeks, and in Washington, health personnel have only had the ability to test locally for a few days. ""It is definitely possible that Covid-19 has been circulating, with people experiencing mild symptoms just like the flu,'' she said. The C.D.C. did not respond to a request for comment. The first patient, a man in his 30s, has recovered after being treated in a hospital isolation unit. The later patient, a teenager, had a mild enough illness to recuperate at home. According to a statement by the Snohomish Health District, the teenager was unaware that he was being tested for the coronavirus. His case came to light on Friday because he went to a clinic on Feb. 24 to be tested for the flu, and his sample was shared with the Seattle Flu Study, which tested it for a variety of pathogens including the new coronavirus.

Tests have been performed on about 1,000 samples from the study, Dr. Lindquist said, with only one positive result thus far. ""So it's not like it's super prevalent,"" he said of the virus. ""I do think, as more community cases start popping up in the United States, this approach and technique could prove very useful to figuring out the extent of community transmission we currently are having,"" Dr. Bedford said of the genetic analysis. Similar analyses have helped public health officials trace cases and fight outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo. On Saturday, local health officials in Seattle said that delays in being able to test for the virus had slowed identification of community cases, meaning those who did not travel to places with major outbreaks or have contact with known patients. ""If we had the ability to test earlier, I'm sure we would have been able to identify patients earlier,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County. Two more confirmed cases in the state were announced on Sunday.

In the first case in Washington, the man in his 30s had been traveling in Wuhan, China, and returned home to Snohomish County, Wash., on Jan. 15. He sought medical care a few days later after developing symptoms and suspecting that he might have the coronavirus, officials have said, and tests later came back positive. Health officials then scrambled to retrace his history, tracking down eight people he had socialized with at a group lunch and 37 more who were in the clinic when he showed up for medical help. They also reached out to people on his flight back to the United States. But as the man remained in hospital isolation, and then later returned home, officials reported no new cases in Washington state. They tested two dozen people over a span of five weeks, and all came back negative. That changed this week, when the state laboratory became able to test for the virus. Officials reported two new confirmed cases Friday night, and then more, including the first patient to die of the virus in the United States. They are now working to trace how the cases in the state might be linked, and who else might have been exposed. Two cases have been detected at a skilled nursing facility in Kirkland, Wash., where officials said dozens of other people also had symptoms that could be a sign of coronavirus infection but could also be symptoms of flu. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington has declared a state of emergency, and said officials may need to take steps like canceling sporting events and closing schools to slow the spread of the virus in the community."
34707,The Wildest Roller Coasters of 2018,"From steep spinning coasters to single-rail sensations, the most innovative thrill rides of the new season.","The new hybrid roller coaster Steel Vengeance at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/travel/29coasters-steelvengeance1/29coasters-steelvengeance1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bdf78462222f9ccfa299da8ab03c3daa2bbbdf6d58e524791fc1e18bde997411&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/travel/new-roller-coasters-2018.html,a74af1ea-0eb4-5d8e-9965-8bb111ddebc9.jpg,"When approaching this roller coaster, it's hard not to be astonished by its look: With a wispy flat yellow track that twists and turns through the sky in all kinds of iterations, it really does evoke Wonder Woman's lasso of truth. The coaster , manufactured by the Idaho company Rocky Mountain Construction, is built on a single I-beam rail, which means that the train's wheels hug the sides of one rail of track, rather than rolling over two tracks like most coasters.

These tracks are narrow and the trains are too, carrying only eight people total, and with riders sitting single file in bobsled-style cars that straddle the track and put you right in the middle of it. That may be bad news for those who like to share the experience with a buddy, but if you are in front, it gives the impression that the coaster is all yours. Although only eight people can ride at a time, the trains load quickly. Indeed, in the station, you get in the car while it is slowly moving on the track to keep the flow constantly going in and out.

The ride, which is positioned inside of quarry walls and occasionally rises above them and over a man-made pond , is both fast and smooth. The track seems like it's barely there, but the compact nature of the ride makes it feel even faster and more immediate. After the first drop, you glide through each element (including an impressive, tightly-wound 360-degree roll), never slowing until reaching the too-fast conclusion. With this coaster (and the similarly designed RailBlazer at California's Great America), an experience has been crafted to feel more personal than most rides .

Take everything you've known about roller coasters and start spinning it -- that will get you close to understanding what a thrilling surprise a ride like Time Traveler is. This coaster is a huge investment (to the tune of $26 million) for Silver Dollar City, tucked in the Ozark Mountains. It's also a record-breaker in a few different ways, billed as the fastest, tallest and steepest complete-circuit spinning coaster in the world. I had the benefit of riding it my first time with the 52 Places Traveler columnist Jada Yuan -- and we basked in its wonders together, including the 10-story drop that starts the ride while your train has already begun to spin.

There's a lot going on, but somehow it all makes sense and you're able to keep a sense of where you are in the ride. Sort of. The train has you seated in four-person pods with two seats on each side facing away from each other. Mack Rides, its German manufacturer, has programmed the cars to spin in a controlled manner using magnetic technology, so you're not twirling at nausea-inducing levels. While that still might sound terrifying, the ride is actually built more for fun and families than it is for sheer white-knuckle thrills, and feels more free-spirited when it's in action.

As the car spins, you have the opportunity to interact with the other riders, which is not common on a roller coaster. I loved being able to see how others are enjoying the 95-foot tall vertical loop along with you. This is a coaster worth repeat rides -- in the front, middle and back -- because you really do get three different interactive and physical experiences in each position. The back is the one for those looking for maximum intensity: Having the full weight of the train pull you down the first drop while you're spinning in the back is a priceless feeling.

If a mad scientist got his hands on some roller coaster track and started building it using every tool at his disposal, it probably still wouldn't feel as crazy and intense as Steel Vengeance. It's a bit of a Frankencoaster, with wood used from the old Cedar Point coaster Mean Streak and a steel track and layout that have been completely refashioned. The resulting hybrid comes from the same manufacturer as Golden Lasso, Rocky Mountain Construction. While that company has become quite the expert at coaster rehabilitation and reconstruction, it has reached new heights here, creating the world's tallest hybrid at 205 feet (a hypercoaster), with a mind-blowing 90-degree first drop.

I live for airtime, those moments of weightlessness you feel in your gut that pull you right out of your seat. Steel Vengeance features a whopping 27 seconds of airtime, an astonishing amount for a ride that lasts all of two and a half minutes. And it also manages to pack in four inversions, sending riders twisting through what feel like vortexes of wood and steel. The wood on this ride does a nice job of shielding its elements, keeping riders surprised. It's one of the few coasters I've ridden that dares you not to be completely exhilarated by everything it accomplishes.

Ah, the dive coaster. It's a sinister type of ride that takes you up the lift and, right before you go down the first hill, pauses, forcing you to look directly down at your fate. Then comes the plunge. As fun as these coasters are, there are only a handful of them in the United States, and before this year, there were none in California, one of the most coaster-populous states. HangTime, a cute little aqua-colored sensation, has arrived to change that."

12588,Why Some Indian Women Still Turn to Matchmakers to Find Love,"For some modern Indian women, arranged marriages are still a popular choice for meeting a spouse.","Aparna Shewakramani, a Houston-based lawyer and luxury travel consultant, participated in Netflix&rsquo;s reality TV show, &ldquo;Indian Matchmaking.&rdquo;",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/fashion/00IndianArrangedMarriage-04/00IndianArrangedMarriage-04-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=91c2c4f22b5234c83704f7d137c53ce5535964ae37638d91ddfe2836c6090607&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/fashion/weddings/why-some-indian-women-still-turn-to-matchmakers-to-find-love.html,bdc6ffe9-69b2-5540-a588-0f6508ea7f28.jpg,"In the first two minutes of Netflix's hit reality show ""Indian Matchmaking,"" Sima Taparia, a Mumbai-based matchmaker, declares, ""In India, we don't say arranged marriage. There is marriage and then love marriage."" A large majority of the country's population that opts to be set up is a testimony to the popularity of this timeless tradition. The eight binge-worthy episodes by Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker Smriti Mundhra follow Ms. Taparia on her quest to find suitable spouses for hopeful singles of Indian descent from around the world. Reviews of the show have been polarized -- sparking debates on patriarchy, colorism, gender stereotypes and regressive mentalities, and also bringing this centuries-old practice under a scanner. Does the system have a lot of growing up to do? Ample. But does that automatically mean everyone associated with an arranged marriage is scathed, pursuing it only under pressure? Such has been the general -- and sometimes unfair -- assumption. Because of my Indian heritage, I have been on the receiving end of questions like, ""Do you have to marry someone you've never met?"" and ""Will your parents choose your husband?"" by my non-South Asian friends in the past. Aparna Shewakramani, a 35-year-old Houston-based lawyer and luxury travel consultant, one of the participants on the show, adds: ""A lot of women outside the South Asian diaspora messaged me on Instagram to say that up until they saw ""Indian Matchmaking,"" they thought that an arranged marriage meant a forced one.""

The rationale is echoed by Anokhi Shah, 28, a Mumbai-born public relations consultant in Antwerp. She married Swapnil Bhansali, an Antwerp-based diamond trader, earlier this year, after being introduced by their respective aunts in March 2019. ""'Love' or 'arranged' marriages are just terminologies,"" she said. ""Does it matter if you find happiness in the end? I was always open to every avenue to find my life partner."" The common connections between the two worked in Ms. Shah's favor. ""It definitely adds a layer of security,"" she said. ""You have access to this person's family background, values and lifestyle. Someone you know can vouch for them.""

It also helped that they were able to broach important subjects -- as you need to with the person you will share your hopes, dreams and bank accounts, and raise children with -- without tiptoeing around them. ""These are conversations you'd typically have after years of dating,"" Ms. Shah said. But since you are both in it with the same intention, you can be honest from the get-go.""

So is romance replaced with rationality? Anoli Udani, 32-year-old fashion designer raised in Ahmedabad, India, doesn't think so. Ms. Udani met her husband, Arjun Udani, a health care and pharmaceutical entrepreneur who lives between Mumbai, Dubai and Lagos, through a distant aunt who is also a matchmaker in 2016. ""We had a first date, traveled together during our courtship, and he even proposed,"" Ms. Udani said. ""No part of our love story was diluted just because we were introduced formally."" She added: ""Everyone wants the serendipitous meet-cute. But if you are self-employed or live in a small town, the opportunities to meet someone new can be limited. It's not very different from broadening your search through your friend circle or a dating app."" In this case, filtered profiles are replaced with equally precise biodatas, and families need to swipe right, too. Despite success stories, the framework is far from perfect. For every progressive mind-set, there is a peculiar criterion. Cue: the excessive focus on ""fair, tall, slim and trim"" on ""Indian Matchmaking."" Appearance, education, age, community, family background and horoscopes play no minor role in narrowing down prospects, either. Assessments like ""too stubborn"" or ""too picky,"" and unsolicited advice on ""adjustment and compromise"" are liberally directed toward women. ""The process had its highs and lows,"" Ms. Udani said. ""There was a societal expectation for me to get married when I turned 25. But my parents had a more realistic and modern view that aligned with mine."""
9337,Parenting in the Bubble: 'This Is Mom's Job. You Have to Work With Me.',"As sports return, some female athletes have entered restricted environments with their children in tow. Their leagues have taken steps to make it easier.",Jessica McDonald brought her 8-year-old son into the N.W.S.L. bubble.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/20/sports/00bubbleparenting-1/00bubbleparenting-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=3da0f58dcdd756884c1a6cbc640ed1a11fb5b93056203de78d991771a5695907&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/sports/soccer/parenting-bubble-nwsl-wnba.html,540a69ac-76f4-5cc3-9e88-9e8293646059.jpg,"Parenting in the Bubble: 'This Is Mom's Job. You Have to Work With Me.'

When her soccer team returned to the field in June, Amy Rodriguez had a familiar problem. Alone in Utah with her two sons, she needed to get back to work but had no way to hire child care help because of the pandemic. So Rodriguez did what only felt normal after years of balancing her professional soccer career with being a mother: She set up her 3- and 6-year-old sons with blankets, toys and an iPad on the sideline and jogged out for her workouts. The boys were used to being patient. But occasionally Rodriguez had to step away from training with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Utah Royals, to deal with a bloody nose or a sibling squabble. ""I've had to talk it over with them,"" she said. ""'This is mom's job. You have to work with me.'"" As American professional sports return this summer inside so-called bubble environments that limit outsiders, the challenges of parenting in a pandemic -- already felt by health care workers, first-responders and stressed-out families -- have hit home for dozens of elite athletes, and for mothers in particular.

Children and families are not allowed in men's league bubbles, partly out of concerns over the size of the operation and its cost. But those decisions, and the different ones in women's leagues, also are a reflection of how American society largely treats child-rearing as the responsibility of women even as the workload takes a toll on their careers and mental health. Some N.B.A. and Major League Soccer players have cited family reasons for staying away as their sports have returned. But Rodriguez, her N.W.S.L. colleagues and their counterparts in the W.N.B.A. often have less of a choice; they play in leagues in which athletes rarely enjoy the kind of elaborate (and expensive) support systems required to excel as both athletes and parents. That is why the unusual accommodations they are seeing since moving from team-run training camps to league-arranged lockdown sites have been a welcome surprise.

N.W.S.L. players say it is the first time they have seen the league make real efforts for mothers. A similar shift is underway in the W.N.B.A.'s bubble in Florida, thanks to gains in the league's new collective bargaining agreement with its players. ""It shocked me that they even reached out to us,"" said North Carolina Courage forward Jessica McDonald, who took her 8-year-old son to the N.W.S.L.'s summer tournament in Utah. McDonald said she had been reassured early on that she and her son would be comfortable and safe. But she also had another thought: ""It was like, really? Where has this support been my entire career?""

Candace Parker, the veteran star of the W.N.B.A.'s Los Angeles Sparks, has moved into a two-bedroom apartment with her 11-year-old daughter, Lailaa, in order to play. To make it work, Parker said she had to piece together child care help from family members over the 40-plus days she expected to be in sporting lockdown. But there was never any question, Parker said, that Lailaa would come. ""She had her bags packed before I did,"" Parker said. ""It's always been that way where I'm better when she's here. I don't think the Sparks would want me without her."" Terri Jackson, the president of the W.N.B.A. players' union, said that as the plans for a Florida bubble were being drawn up, the league made it clear that it would give priority to mothers, offering them their choice of housing and taking care of some costs that other players are expected to cover. That was a significant step forward, Jackson said. ""If you took a historical look across the league, it made you ask: If this is a women's sports league, where are the moms?"" she said. ""You wonder, how many players that are looking to become moms have we lost? ""We should have more Candaces -- and Lailaas -- in the league."" Unlike the W.N.B.A., which is in its third decade, the N.W.S.L. is still finding its financial footing in its eighth season, and salaries are still comparatively low -- $20,000 to $60,000 a year. But mothers in the league praised the proactive moves taken by the new commissioner, Lisa Baird, who took charge of the N.W.S.L. in February after it had been leaderless for several years. Baird is also a mother, with a college-age daughter who, on the league's shoestring budget, has been helping with child care inside the league's bubble in Herriman, Utah, near Salt Lake City.

Even before the N.W.S.L.'s announcement that it would return to the field this summer, Baird held a conference call with the mothers in the league, asking them what they and their children would need to take part. Getting buy-in from the mothers was a key part of getting the players association on board, a league representative said. ""They're professional athletes, and they take their jobs as moms very seriously,"" Baird said. ""For them, it wasn't, 'Make this special concession.' It was: 'This is what I need. This is part of my job.'"" In the N.W.S.L.'s Utah complex, mothers have been allowed to bring along a caregiver. McDonald and Rodriguez are living with their children in an apartment complex, but Stephanie Cox, a player for OL Reign, elected to stay in the team hotel with her daughters, 7 and 4.

This weekend, McDonald and her North Carolina teammates will begin the knockout round of the Challenge Cup. As the top seed, the Courage are expected to reach the final, success that will only extend her stay with Jeremiah. But like Rodriguez and Parker and others, she is hoping the bar has been raised for good. ""I'm hoping and praying that the way they're treating us is going to carry into our future seasons,"" McDonald said."
23279,Facebook Antitrust Inquiry Shows Big Tech's Freewheeling Era Is Past,Two settlements and a new antitrust investigation highlighted a new reality for tech giants: Scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers has become a constant.,"While the F.T.C. was known to be looking into antitrust issues at Facebook, it had not been previously reported that the agency had begun a full investigation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/24/business/24facebook/24facebook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=cce0691c581239da8bb5b504d521e25724d28c01e8282b111479e4a29d6cc01e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust-investigation.html,b1dc8829-b720-59fd-92b5-7eacd0293377.jpg,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook came under siege on multiple fronts on Wednesday, agreeing to new layers of oversight and two fines to settle privacy and disclosure violations, even as it acknowledged that it was under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission for antitrust concerns. Early in the day, the company was penalized by the F.T.C. with a record $5 billion fine for deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal data. As part of a settlement, the company was also ordered to create a new privacy committee on its board and to make other structural changes to increase the transparency and accountability of its data practices. But the agreement was criticized for failing to limit Facebook's gathering, sharing and use of people's personal information, a practice that has repeatedly raised privacy questions. And the F.T.C.'s commissioners were divided on partisan lines this month when they voted 3-to-2 to approve the measures, which provide immunity to Facebook's officers and directors and shield the company from known claims of violations through last month -- essentially giving it a pass on its past. At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it had imposed a $100 million penalty against Facebook for making misleading disclosures to investors about the risks of misuse of user data. The S.E.C. said Facebook had known for two years about that misuse, but had presented those risks to investors as merely hypothetical.

Mr. Zuckerberg did not specifically address the antitrust concerns but said on a conference call with investors, ""with the guidance and expectations from regulators, we have a clearer path forward."" He called for more government oversight of the tech industry at large. The F.T.C. confirmed the antitrust investigation against Facebook and declined to comment further. The agency's five commissioners put out dueling statements on the privacy settlement. The three Republican commissioners -- including the F.T.C. chairman, Joseph J. Simons -- who voted to approve the deal said they were ""proud"" of the agreement and believed the measures ""will provide significant deterrence not just to Facebook, but to every other company that collects or uses consumer data."" But the two Democratic commissioners disagreed. One of them, Rohit Chopra, warned that the terms of the settlement legally shielded Facebook from liability for a wide range of past problematic practices. ""This shield represents a major win for Facebook, but leaves the public in the dark as to how the company violated the law and what violations, if any, are going unaddressed,"" he said. Even as the scrutiny around Facebook has grown, its business has remained strong. It said on Wednesday that revenue for its second quarter rose 28 percent from a year ago to $16.9 billion. While profits fell 49 percent to $2.6 billion because of a one-time $2 billion charge to pay the F.T.C.'s fine and an accounting charge related to tax deductions, Facebook still performed better than Wall Street had expected. ""Facebook, with all of its missteps over the past two years, is going to remain a strong stock over the next few years,"" said Shawn Riegsecker, chief executive of the ad-technology company Centro. The F.T.C.'s privacy settlement with Facebook follows an investigation over the past year into whether the company had violated a 2011 privacy agreement with the agency. Under that earlier agreement, the social network had said it would not deceive people over how their information was used and shared. Then last year, a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London revealed how Facebook had allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm to the Trump campaign, to harvest the personal information of its users. Cambridge Analytica had used the data to build profiles of American voters without the consent of Facebook users.

In its settlement with Facebook on Wednesday, the F.T.C. said it had mandated that the social network create an independently appointed privacy committee on its board to review decisions affecting user privacy. That would reduce the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg and others to unilaterally make decisions, the agency said. The F.T.C. also ordered Facebook to designate compliance officers to oversee a privacy program, undergo regular privacy audits that Mr. Zuckerberg and others must submit to, and appoint an outside assessor to monitor the handling of data. All of these would increase Facebook's transparency and accountability, the agency said. Yet the F.T.C.'s two Democratic commissioners said the measures were inadequate. Facebook's officers should be held personally liable for privacy transgressions, they argued, and more needed to be done to curb the company's data-mining practices. They also said that a $5 billion fine was a drop in the bucket. ""When companies can violate the law, pay big penalties and still turn a profit while keeping their business model intact, enforcement agencies cannot claim victory,"" Mr. Chopra said in his dissent. The three Republican commissioners said that the $5 billion fine was ""record breaking"" and that it reset the baseline for privacy cases. They also said the F.T.C. did not have a strong enough case to move forward with any litigation against Facebook. Ultimately, Mr. Simons and the other two Republican commissioners, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, said the concessions they were able to extract with a settlement were more valuable -- and far more certain -- than what might be achieved with a drawn-out legal battle. ""Is the relief we would obtain through this settlement equal to or better than what we could reasonably obtain through litigation?"" they said. ""If the answer had been 'no,' it would have made sense to aggressively move forward in court. The answer, however, was 'yes.'"""

In the continuing debate over whether liberals or conservatives are more open minded, whether those on the left or the right are more rigid in their thinking, a team of four Canadian psychologists studied patterns of ""cognitive reflection"" among Americans. They found that a willingness to change one's convictions in the face of new evidence was robustly associated with political liberalism, the rejection of traditional moral values, the acceptance of science, and skepticism about religious, paranormal, and conspiratorial claims. Those who ranked high on a scale designed to measure the level of a respondent's ""actively open-minded thinking about evidence"" were linked with the acceptance of ""anthropogenic global warming and support for free speech on college campuses."" Conversely, the authors -- Gordon Pennycook of the University of Regina, and James Allan Cheyne, Derek J. Koehler and Jonathan A. Fugelsang of the University of Waterloo -- found that an aversion to altering one's belief on the basis of evidence was more common among conservatives and that this correlated ""with beliefs about topics ranging from extrasensory perception, to respect for tradition, to abortion, to God."" In their forthcoming paper, ""On the belief that beliefs should change according to evidence,"" the authors develop an eight-item ""Actively Open-minded Thinking about Evidence Scale."" People taking the test are asked their level of agreement or disagreement with a series of statements including: ""A person should always consider new possibilities."" ""Certain beliefs are just too important to abandon no matter how good a case can be made against them."" ""One should disregard evidence that conflicts with your established beliefs."" ""No one can talk me out of something I know is right."" ""I believe that loyalty to one's ideals and principles is more important than 'open-mindedness'."" People who reported believing that beliefs and opinions should change according to evidence were less likely to be religious, less likely to hold paranormal and conspiratorial beliefs, more likely to believe in a variety of scientific claims, and were more politically liberal in terms of overall ideology, partisan affiliation, moral values, and a variety of specific political opinions. In other words, there is one more item to add to the constantly growing list of factors driving polarization in America: Those on the left and right appear to use substantially different cognitive processes to interpret events in the world around them, large and small.

At the same time, there are scholars who raise questions about these and similar conclusions concerning the reported differences in open-mindedness between conservatives and liberals. ""Discrimination Across the Ideological Divide: The Role of Value Violations and Abstract Values in Discrimination by Liberals and Conservatives,"" a 2013 paper by Geoffrey A. Wetherell, Mark J. Brandt and Christine Reyna of Valparaiso University, Tilburg University in the Netherlands and DePaul University, challenges the common notion that there are marked differences between liberals and conservatives on measures of tolerance and bias: ""Despite ample research linking conservatism to discrimination and liberalism to tolerance, both groups may discriminate,"" they write. In their research, Wetherell and his colleagues demonstrate that liberals and conservatives supported discrimination against ideologically dissimilar groups, an effect mediated by perceptions of value violations. Liberals were more likely than conservatives to espouse egalitarianism and universalism, which attenuated their discrimination; whereas the conservatives' value of traditionalism predicted more discrimination, and their value of self-reliance predicted less discrimination. Disputes over differences in judgment, character and moral values between liberals and conservatives are among the most fraught topics in political psychology. Look, for example, at the controversial conclusion reached in ""Combating Fake News: An Agenda for Research and Action,"" a research report released in May 2017 by Harvard's Kennedy School and Northeastern University: ""While any group can come to believe false information, misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right."" Some conservative voters ""are even suspicious of fact-checking sites,"" the report continued, leaving them ""particularly susceptible to misinformation."" The report also noted that ""there is at least anecdotal evidence that when Republicans are in power, the left becomes increasingly susceptible to promoting and accepting fake news.""

Or consider a 2019 paper, ""False Equivalence: Are Liberals and Conservatives in the United States Equally Biased?"" by Jonathan Baron and John Jost, professors of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and N.Y.U., who write, ""Nowadays we read that liberals are every bit as authoritarian as conservatives; as rigid and simple-minded; as intolerant; as prejudiced."" ironic and more than a little bewildering that social psychologists are drifting into this relativistic view of morality and politics just as authoritarian conservatism (and illiberal hostility to democratic norms) seem to be reaching new heights of popularity and brazenness not only in Trump's America but also in Erdogan's Turkey, Orban's Hungary, and Netanyahu's Israel. Baron and Jost also cite studies suggesting that those on the right are more susceptible to authoritarian appeals: Conservatives score higher than liberals on measures of personal needs for order and structure, cognitive closure, intolerance of ambiguity, cognitive or perceptual rigidity, and dogmatism. Liberals, they write, ""perform better than conservatives on objective tests of cognitive ability and intelligence"" while conservatives ""score higher than liberals on measures of self-deception"" and ""are more likely than liberals to spread 'fake news,' political misinformation, and conspiracy theories throughout their online social networks."" In a 2018 paper, Baron argues for the necessity of flexible thinking in a democracy: In order for a democracy to function well (both for its own citizens and outsiders), its citizens need to endorse three (somewhat synergistic) social norms, which I called cosmopolitanism, anti-moralism, and actively open-minded thinking. In making his case, Baron cites John Stuart Mill's essay ""On Liberty,"" specifically this famous passage: The whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, depending on the one property, that it can be set right when it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it become so? Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions and conduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all that could be said against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound to himself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious. It may be, however, that the very complexity of thought and resolve proposed by Baron and Mill would be resisted, and indeed resented, by many on the right. In a February 2019 paper, ""Liberals lecture, conservatives communicate: Analyzing complexity and ideology in 381,609 political speeches,"" four political scientists, Martijn Schoonvelde, Anna Brosius, Gijs Schumacher and Bert N. Bakker, argue that ""speakers from culturally liberal parties use more complex language than speakers from culturally conservative parties"" and that this variance in linguistic complexity is rooted in personality differences among conservative and liberal politicians. The former prefer short, unambiguous statements, and the latter prefer longer compound sentences, expressing multiple points of view. The authors cite studies suggesting that this linguistic divide is persistent: ""The Readability and Simplicity of Donald Trump's Language,"" published in The Political Studies Review and Research on linguistic habits of American and British politicians shows that conservative politicians make less complex statements than liberal politicians. the speeches of liberal US presidents score higher on integrative complexity than those of conservatives, as measured by the presence of ""words involved in differentiation (exclusive words, tentative words, negations) as well as integration of different perspectives (conjunctions)."" conservative political bloggers use less complex language than their liberal counterparts and conservative citizens use language that scores lower on integrative complexity than liberal citizens. Separate studies of the language used by presidents -- both ""The Readability and Simplicity of Donald Trump's Language,"" and an analysis of the language used by the last 15 presidents on the blog Factbase -- concluded that President Trump speaks at the lowest level of all those studied, as measured on the on the Flesch-Kincaid index. As Factbase put it: By any metric to measure vocabulary, using more than a half dozen tests with different methodologies, Donald Trump has the most basic, most simplistically constructed, least diverse vocabulary of any president in the last 90 years. Some scholars argue that a focus on ideological conflict masks the most salient divisions in the era of Donald Trump: authoritarians versus non-authoritarians. Karen Stenner, the author of ""The Authoritarian Dynamic,"" emailed me on this point to say that It's really critical to help people understand the difference between conservatives and authoritarians. Conservatives are by nature opposed to change and novelty, whereas authoritarians are averse to diversity and complexity. It's a subtle but absolutely critical distinction. is an authoritarian revolution -- not a conservative revolution, the term is inherently contradictory -- which in the U.S. has been creeping up since the 1960s. clearly distinct from what I call ""laissez faire conservatism."" In fact, in cross-national research I consistently find that these two dimensions are actually negatively related. If anything, authoritarians tend to be wary of free markets and more supportive of government intervention and redistribution, perhaps even schemes of equalization and progressive taxation. For Stenner, the ""overriding objective of the authoritarian is always to enhance oneness and sameness; to minimize the diversity of people, beliefs and behaviors."" Authoritarianism is a functional disposition concerned with maximizing ""oneness"" and ""sameness"" especially in conditions where the things that make us one and the same -- common authority, and shared values -- appear to be under threat. Threat, she continued, sets in motion an ""authoritarian dynamic"" that activates latent predispositions to authoritarianism and increases their expression in manifest intolerance. That is to say, intolerance is a function of the interaction of authoritarian predisposition with conditions of normative threat. In her email, Stenner argued that ""non-authoritarian conservatives, opposed to change, dedicated to upholding laws, and to the defense of legitimate political and social institutions that underpin societal stability and security"" are a crucial pillar of democratic governance. In the real world, she continued, ""it is the authoritarians who are the revolutionaries."" Because of this authoritarian revolution, here and abroad, Stenner contends that the whole of liberal democracy is in grave danger at this moment. But the fault lies with authoritarians on both the right and the left, and the solution is in the hands of non-authoritarians on both sides. Stenner makes the case that the authoritarian revolution began in the 1960s: ""Once the principle of equal treatment under the law was instituted and entrenched by means of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act,"" traditional conservatism -- ""fidelity to the laws of the land and defense of legitimate institutions"" -- took a back seat to authoritarianism ""as a factor driving expressions of racial, moral and political intolerance.""

Stenner takes the analysis of contemporary conflict and polarization full circle back to the fundamental American divide over race, a subject that touches on virtually every issue facing the nation. And Trump is determined to use authoritarian means to restore race to the core of his campaign. Last week, Trump sent dozens of armed federal forces in camouflage to quell Black Lives Matter protests in Portland. On July 19, Trump responded to a direct question from Chris Wallace of Fox News about whether he would ""accept the election"" win or lose. Trump answered: ""I have to see. Look, you -- I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no."" And on July 20, Trump threatened to send more armed troops to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore and Oakland to quell dissent, noting that these cities' mayors were all ""liberal Democrats."" Put another way, Trump plans to echo George Wallace and take his stand in the schoolhouse door or, even more ominously, to use urban America as his Alamo."

THESE VIOLENT DELIGHTS is a New York Times Best Seller!!! THANK YOU FOR READING AND PICKING UP THIS BOOK I NEED TO LIE DOWN."" It's not every day that a 21-year-old debut author lands near the top of the young adult hardcover list, even for a week; if there was ever an occasion that called for abundant exclamation points, this was the one.

Gong, a Shanghai native who grew up in Auckland, New Zealand, is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, where she is double-majoring in English and international relations. She says she was in her ""tiny college apartment"" in Philadelphia, working on ""something that was due very soon,"" when she heard the ""surreal but amazing"" news: ""My editor called me, and my agent was already on the line, and I was trembling. I'm still trembling. The New York Times best-seller list is. ... Whoa. Big thing.""

""These Violent Delights"" -- a reimagining of ""Romeo and Juliet"" set in 1920s Shanghai -- is Gong's first published novel, and the ninth one she's written. She started tapping out stories on the Notes app on her iPad when she was 13. Gong explains: ""New Zealand has a much more chill atmosphere than what I imagine American high schools are like. I watch American TV and everyone has extracurriculars and all that. That's less of a norm in New Zealand. I would have so much free time, and I would be like, 'Hmm. I might work on my book.' I would crank out a manuscript every year.""

Gong wrote the first draft of ""These Violent Delights"" during the summer after her first year of college. Up until that point, she had been under the impression that she couldn't get published because she was from New Zealand. ""But that was completely untrue,"" Gong laughs.

51888,No One Tells Megyn Kelly What to Wear,"In 2016, the Fox News anchor challenged political and gender expectations with both substance and style.","Megyn Kelly says she is ""not going to be defined by what someone else deemed appropriate.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/18/fashion/18MEGYN/18MEGYN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=7061328976261f95dd7bdeadd66c3275b6bff6895d7b52cfb7de8245cc985c11&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/17/fashion/megyn-kelly-fox-fashion.html,8156d548-dc3e-5623-9322-022dda9e80c1.jpg,"Megyn Kelly -- breakout star of the 2016 presidential campaign, anchor of the ""The Kelly File"" on Fox News, current object of employment desire for multiple networks, best-selling author, mother, wife, daughter and friend (the last four being how she describes herself) -- has something she wants everyone to know. Really. A lot. Listen up. Not just that it is dangerous when President-elect Donald J. Trump calls out a single citizen on social media, seemingly giving permission to his followers to turn into rabid attack dogs, although she knows firsthand what that is like, having been the original target of his wrath for almost a year, starting in August 2015. Not just that hard work and an unsparing sense of your own strengths and weaknesses (and those of other people) can put you in a good place, though she writes about that a lot in her book, which is called, naturally, ""Settle for More,"" a catchphrase she also drops strategically into conversation. But also (and this may seem off-topic, but it is not) that she in no way apologizes for wearing that spaghetti-strap dress to the Republican National Convention in July. You know, the one that sent the internet into what she called a ""meltdown"" because it revealed a whole lot of ... shoulder! And thus, was unlike any dress that had been seen on a serious anchor ever, except maybe at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Definitely never behind a desk.

Just to prove it, she has worn it again. Because, she said, ""I felt very strongly, I was not going to be defined by what someone else deemed appropriate."" Indeed, for the past few years, ever since Ms. Kelly, 46, began making a name for herself as the person willing to call out power players on their own contradictions, contortions (verbal and policy-related) and cock-ups, she has become famous for refusing to be boxed in by anyone else's ""appropriate"": not her network's, nor a political party's, nor the mythical dos and don'ts of career girl dress.

In her book she writes that when she went to meet Mr. Trump for the first time since their public tussle to discuss having him do an interview with her, she wore her favorite black sheath Gucci dress. ""I feel strong in it,"" she said. By acknowledging the role clothes play in her own life and psyche, she is contravening one of the last taboos: If women want to be taken seriously, they are not supposed to take fashion seriously. A patently idiotic idea. (If you want to be taken seriously, you had better think seriously about every message you are sending, including the ones in your outfits.) In this she is part of a handful of women in the public eye who are breaking that rule, including Michelle ""no sleeves"" Obama and Sheryl ""no hoodies"" Sandberg.

""We talk about it a lot: What is the world we are trying to create for our daughters -- she has one, I have two -- and how we can move things forward?"" said Debra Netschert, a managing director of Jennison Associates, an asset management firm, who has been friends with Ms. Kelly for about four years. It is not a coincidence that in 2010, when Ms. Kelly moved from the morning show ""America's Newsroom"" to become co-host of the afternoon show ""America Live,"" she hired her own stylist. Generally, the Fox anchors use the Fox stylist, just as they use the Fox hair and makeup people, which is why there is what is generally known as a ""Fox Look"": for women, clingy brightly colored poly-rayon dresses that ""pop"" on TV, tousled hair and a lot of eye makeup, lip gloss and base. But, she said, that means ""we all sort of look the same."" When she started in TV after a nine-year career as a lawyer, she wore mostly navy, black and gray suits, and pinstripes -- a ""lot of Ann Taylor and Theory"" -- but then Fox put her in its wardrobe, ""which was weird, because I had never really worn color before,"" she said. So when she got her own show, she said she decided ""I wanted to define myself differently."" Which is to say, ""as myself,"" rather than as the network's product. She enlisted the help of her neighbor, Dana Perriello, whom she knew first as a mom, but who had a sideline as a personal stylist. Because they were friends before they worked together, ""She knew who I was,"" Ms. Kelly said, and Ms. Perriello had an idea about how Ms. Kelly could express herself. They began to define a ""Megyn look,"" which had to do with clothes that were ""strong, stylish, sleek, tailored, feminine, but not frilly,"" Ms. Kelly said. ""I don't like frills.""

Also, ""You will never catch me in a dress without a pair of Spanx and a bra,"" Ms. Kelly said, and she is happy to explain why. In fact, she thinks it is good to explain why: ""After three children, it all came back together, but it didn't come back together the way it used to be."" Though earlier this year she said that she, along with many of her female colleagues, was sexually harassed by the former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, and though she writes about it in her book, all of that happened during her ""frumpy law-firm suit period,"" not during her later, more fashion-forward period. A fact she pointed out to underscore that such harassment was really about power and not self-presentation. No woman is ""asking for it"" because of what she wears, and no woman should be judged for it, though judging -- in a dismissive and derogatory way -- is exactly what Ms. Kelly experienced earlier this year when Mr. Trump and assorted others resurfaced a 2010 GQ shoot of Ms. Kelly in a black slip and stilettos, draped over a chair. In January, @gene70 tweeted the photo with the message, ""And this is the bimbo that's asking presidential questions?"" Mr. Trump retweeted it. Ms. Kelly was having none of it. ""They tried to slut-shame me!"" she said. ""But I think I looked great. I had just turned 40, and I was pregnant. Some people at Fox still think it was a mistake, but I refuse to have to dismiss these options because of other people's prejudices, and my willingness to engage just proves they are wrong."" In other words, it was appropriate because Megyn Kelly said it was appropriate.

Rhetorically, this is not unlike the argument Gloria Steinem used when someone told her at her 40th birthday that she didn't look 40. Ms. Steinem responded: ""This is what 40 looks like."" Ms. Kelly, however, may not like the comparison. She has regularly refused to categorize herself as a feminist, because she thinks it is nichifying. She also rejects descriptions such as ""pioneer"" and ""trailblazer,"" and says, ""You don't want to get drunk on your own wine,"" and, ""I'm just trying to be authentic."" The irony is, insisting on her femininity while also insisting on her due -- that she can have her career and her family, too, and in your face with a spaghetti strap if you don't like that -- may be the most authentically feminist act of all."

The prize -- $25,000 and a signed print by Willem de Kooning -- is given annually in recognition of a work written by a woman for the English-language theater. Ms. Barron, 31, who is from Wenatchee, Wash., is being honored for ""Dance Nation,"" a new play about a preteen dance competition, which is to be given its first production at Playwrights Horizons, an Off Broadway nonprofit, next year. The play was previously honored with the Relentless Award, given in memory of the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Ms. Barron's best known previous play was ""You Got Older,"" a 2014 work presented by Page 73 Productions, which won an Obie award for playwriting. Last year her play ""I'll Never Love Again,"" at the Bushwick Starr, was praised by The New York Times critic Ben Brantley, who called Ms. Barron an ""exciting young playwright"" and said she ""has the rare gift of being both oblique and perfectly clear -- or as clear as one can be about the irresoluble conflicts of life."""

You'll find her in one of the buzziest films of this awards season, Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman,"" which vied for Best Motion Picture, Drama at the Golden Globes last weekend. And she will appear in two movies this year, including the sci-fi thriller ""Warning"" with Annabelle Wallis and Alice Eve. In the near term, there is the Screen Actors Guild awards, where Ms. Harrier and her ""BlacKkKlansman"" cohort are up for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. Though awards season is exciting, it can also be a grind. See what beauty products Ms. Harrier, a native of Evanston, Ill., is using to survive the back-to-back red carpets. In the shower, I use a face wash from my aesthetician Shani Darden. And she has this lactic peel that I do when I get out of the shower. I alternate between that and serums by iS Clinical. If I'm breaking out, I'll go for the Active serum, and if my skin is dry, I do the Pro-Heal. When I moved to L.A. from New York, almost exactly a year ago, I didn't know anyone. The girl who does my eyebrows, Kim Nguyen, told me about Shani, and she kind of saved my face. I like that she's straight up and tells you exactly what you need to do. For me, it's dealing with breakouts. I didn't struggle with it until late in my 20s. That has been really annoying. It's all the travel, stress and whatever else.

For a long time, I was very into superclean, natural skin care. I'll still do a manuka honey mask in the bath, but with all the breakout issues, I've had to amp it up. When my skin was perfect, the natural stuff was cool. But if I'm having issues, they don't do enough. Before I head out, I do an SPF 30 -- the one by Control Corrective. It's really lightweight and just feels like a moisturizer. At night I use the Bioderma micellar water to remove makeup. I wash again with Shani's cleanser, and then I use her retinol. I'm not using the retinol for wrinkles, but it helps a lot with my acne scarring. And my skin feels smoother. I love to watch the makeup artists at work. Now I can do my makeup for an event if I have to. Day to day, though, I keep it minimal. I do the Nars concealer -- my color is Caramel. Then it's Glossier Boy Brow every day in Black. I have the Tom Ford Shade and Illuminate palette that comes with the two colors. I throw on the highlighter for everyday and do the contour color if I'm going out. I like the Lash Slick by Glossier for day -- it's pretty and natural.

At night, I switch to the Marc Jacobs mascara. The makeup artist Hung Vanngo told me about it. I've learned the most from him and from Nina Park. Nina has taught me that if I have an early press day and look terrible, do a lip. She'll look at my face and say, ""Uhhh, O.K., let's do a lip on you!"" With an eye look, you can still look tired and droopy. A bright lip color is lifting, and honestly, it's easy. I have this YSL matte lip stain that I love so much, the bottom label has worn off. Now I don't even know the color. Ruby Woo by M.A.C. is always good. I really like the RMS Lip2Cheek colors. You can layer them so you can choose if you want to go lighter or darker. I also wear foundation if I have an event. I mix the Tom Ford one with the Tom Ford highlighting primer. My hair is so dry, it's like the desert. It's like sand in the desert, it's so rough. I do make an attempt to moisturize, but it's really tough to get ahead of it when I'm working a lot. All the heat styling damages it, and I have really fine hair. I do Olaplex a lot. I throw it on like a hair mask and go to SoulCycle. I feel like it heats up in there! I like the Shu Uemura shampoos and conditioners. I also use Oribe Gold Lust hair oil.

I usually get my hair cut by Teddi Cranford in New York, but I'm actually trying to grow it out, so I haven't had it cut in ages. People always tell you that you have to cut your hair in order to grow it, but whatever, I don't want to. And it doesn't even make sense, as your hair is growing from your scalp!

I had the best smell ever: this tiny unmarked vial from Morocco that my friend got for me. It smells like orange blossom. I used to get so many compliments. I have saved literally one drop just so I can smell it. Now I do these roll-ons from Maison Louis Marie. In the winter I do No. 04, but more recently I've been doing the Antidris Cassis one. I get massages, but I don't have one particular person I go to. It's the same with mani-pedis. Kim plucks my brows, but really barely, and she also tints them. I love a brow tint. They make such a big difference on your face. Carrie Lindsey, who used to do my brows in New York, was the first one to tint my brows, but I had to talk her into it. That was maybe two years ago, and now I won't go back. Overall, though, I'm way more of a New York girl in every aspect of my life. People do so much in L.A. I'm not that girl. I'm not getting everything waxed every other week. I'd rather do the bare minimum. I've actually been lazier here in L.A. In New York, I would go to the Dogpound. My friend Kirk Myers founded it. Now, in L.A., I go to SoulCycle and barre class and hot yoga, but I bounce around. Also, I've been traveling so much that it's hard to keep anything together. I downloaded the Nike app to work out while I travel, and I think I did it once. For me, diet is about moderation. I work out, but I love cheese, pasta and wine. As I say that, I'm drinking a green smoothie that was a million dollars at Erewhon. The truth is, the timing of awards season, right after the holidays, is really cruel. I'm not at my peak right now. Honestly, I'm just trying to work out a lot, and I'll go to Shani for a peel before a big awards show. I do the infrared sauna, too. I feel it helps. There's also this infrared sauna where they wrap you like a burrito. I haven't tried that one yet, but it kind of seems like torture. You're paying someone to wrap a hot blanket around you."

That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here.

Good morning. Cooking is about so much more than recipes. Two considerations of that fact appear in The Times this week. The first comes from Gabrielle Hamilton, a columnist for our magazine, a chef and the owner of Prune, in the East Village, who delivered an amazing treatise on what's basically a no-recipe recipe for radishes with sweet butter and kosher salt. ""With just three ingredients,"" she cautions, ""there is nowhere to hide."" So make sure they're great ingredients. Then lay them out and swipe, dip and sprinkle, as you like. (Or get radical, and make a sandwich.)

The second is on the cover of the Food section we printed last night, then put into bags and this morning threw onto the porches and sidewalks of subscribers all across the United States. It is a consideration by Julia Moskin of what the New York chef Justin Smillie calls ""sensory cooking"" -- not just taste, not just smell, but sight, hearing and touch as well. Read it, and you may well want to cook Mr. Smillie's recipe for thrice-cooked roast chicken when you're done.

Because, of course, recipes are at the heart of what we do here. And here are two new ones now. Take a look at David Tanis's recipe for monkfish roasted with herbs and olives. Consider Melissa Clark's recipe for ande ki kari, an Indian curry of hard-boiled eggs swathed in a spicy tomato gravy. Either would make for a fine dinner sometime this week."

But climate change threatens to disrupt these journeys.,"Scientists fitted red-backed shrikes, pictured, and thrush nightingales with tiny geo-locators that recorded sunlight levels, to track their routes as they migrated.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/05/science/04ZIMMER/04ZIMMER-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=6fa1205c558cbd8837e0ae77a41d2282a54d5d0854649f93e19a24cd10efd06b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/science/on-long-migrations-birds-chase-an-eternal-spring.html,ea0aed62-0d5a-50a0-bd8f-9a2091b061b8.jpg,"Bird migrations have stumped the greatest minds for thousands of years. Aristotle thought that the robins living in Greece in the winter somehow turned into redstarts in the summer. In fact, robins migrate from Greece to Northern Europe around the time redstarts arrive from Africa. Scientists have gotten a much better understanding of bird migration in recent centuries, but there's a tremendous amount they have yet to learn. After tracking more than three dozen birds with sensors for thousands of miles, a team of researchers reported on Wednesday that their migration defied the expected course. Instead of simply flying straight from their summer grounds in Denmark to their winter site in Africa, the birds stretched out their journey, stopping at several places along the way for weeks at a time. ""It's more of a nomadic life,"" said Kasper Thorup, a bird migration expert at the University of Copenhagen and co-author of the new study. ""They hardly have a place to call home.""

The journey was exquisitely well timed to coincide with high levels of vegetation at each site, he and his colleagues found. These habits, honed by thousands of years of evolution, probably helped them enjoy a good diet of insects on their trip. This may be a common strategy among the world's migratory birds, but Dr. Thorup and his colleagues warn that it may be threatened by climate change. Previous generations of researchers could rely only on indirect clues to the travels of birds. Traditionally, ornithologists caught a bird at its summer breeding grounds, put an identifying band on its leg, and then waited for someone to spot it wherever it ended up for the winter. Such studies said little about where the birds went between points A and B. Today's migration researchers are finally filling in some of those gaps. Some are analyzing millions of crowdsourced bird sightings. Others are fitting birds with miniature tracking devices.

Efforts The corncrake's loud cry was once a common sound of summer in Ireland, but these days it can seldom be heard. Efforts are underway to bring it back ""We have all these resources coming online, and so we can replace speculation with observation,"" said Frank A. La Sorte, a research associate at the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. In 2002, the Cornell lab started a program called eBird with the Audubon Society. Amateurs fill out an online form each time they go birding, noting all the species they spot. Dr. La Sorte and his colleagues analyze the records, tracking a number of migratory birds that travel through North America each year.

The researchers have found that birds migrate in loops, rather than follow a straight line north and south. In summer, birds heading to eastern North America, for instance, catch tailwinds that help them get over the Gulf of Mexico. The birds end up drifting to the west, but they still save energy despite the longer route. On the way back south, though, they take a more direct path across the Gulf. In western North America, food plays a big part in the migration loop. Birds fly at night and then land to feed on insects during the day. In the spring, their routes take them to places where plants have put on a lot of growth. That's probably also where the birds can find insect larvae to eat. While eBird gives Dr. La Sorte information about millions of birds, it can show him only what birders are seeing. Other researchers are suiting up small squadrons of birds with tracking devices to follow them through their entire migrations. For the new study, published in the journal Science Advances, Dr. Thorup and his colleagues put lightweight devices on common cuckoos. As the birds migrated between Denmark and Central Africa, they sent signals to satellites showing their location. The researchers also tracked two smaller migratory species traveling from Denmark to sub-Saharan Africa: thrush nightingales and red-backed shrikes. These birds are too small to carry the weight of satellite transmitters, so Dr. Thorup and his colleagues fitted them with even tinier devices called geo-locators. These sensors record only sunlight levels throughout each day. When the birds returned to Denmark, the scientists recovered the geo-locators and used each day's data to plot the birds' routes.

Studying 38 birds in total, the scientists found the animals didn't move directly from their summer grounds to their winter grounds. Instead, the birds would fly for a few days, stop somewhere for a few weeks, and then move on again. Red-backed shrikes, for example, leave Denmark and reach southeast Europe in August. In October, they go to East Africa. By December, they're in southern Africa. And in April, they're back in East Africa again. Throughout their journey, the scientists found, the three species timed their flights so that they reached feeding grounds once they were abundant with vegetation. Dr. Thorup suspects that the birds are able to make meals of local insect larvae feeding on the plants. The new data show that even though the birds ended up in the same places in Africa, they sometimes followed different routes. Dr. La Sorte and his colleagues have found similar flexibility in North American birds, which often adjust their route and speed when over the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean, perhaps to cope with changing weather conditions. It's possible that birds somehow combine short-range flexibility with a navigation system, hard-wired into the brain, that guides them to the places where they can find the most food to eat. ""You don't cross the Sahara without knowing it's good on the other side,"" said Dr. Thorup. That strategy works well when birds can be sure to find food at the same place at the same time each year. But climate change is altering the calculus. In Northern Europe and North America, for example, plants are greening up earlier in the spring. In Africa, rainfall patterns are shifting, changing the times at which plants put on new leaves and fruit."

""I still text him even though he's not here: 'Thank you for everything. The rest is for you. Rest easy my guy.' The last one I sent him said: 'I miss you. May you rest in peace my dear friend.' The texts go through, but no response. It still feels like he's there on the other end. That the next time I pick up my phone he would have hit me back."" Ionescu honored Gianna Bryant as well as Kobe at Monday's memorial. ""I wanted to be part of the generation that changed basketball with Gigi and her teammates,"" Ionescu said. Jenna Schoenefeld for The New York Times Her parents were born in Romania. Her father emigrated to the United States shortly after the Romanian revolution in 1989, and her mother moved to the United States in 1995. Sabrina was born in California and was one of the most coveted high school recruits in basketball, choosing Oregon. A 5-foot-11 point guard, she won gold medals with the American under-17 and under-23 teams. At Oregon, she was the college national freshman of the year. As a sophomore, she was named point guard of the year, and as a junior last season she repeated as point guard of the year while also winning both the Wade Trophy and the John R. Wooden Award, which are presented annually to the top collegiate player. She has been racking up the statistical achievements. She has more triple-doubles, 26, than any collegian, male or female. She holds Oregon's career records in points, assists and 3-pointers. She surpassed Gary Payton as the Pac-12's career assists leader. When she arrived at Oregon, the team had not made the N.C.A.A. tournament in 12 years. With Ionescu in the lineup, Oregon made the final eight of the tournament two straight years and the Final Four last season. Ionescu flew from the memorial service to Stanford for a game. Oregon won, 74-66, and although she missed the shoot-around and warm-ups, she scored 21 points with 12 rebounds and 12 assists. She also became the first player to reach 2,000 career points, 1,000 assists and 1,000 rebounds in a collegiate career. Ionescu achieved this even though she had been feeling ill earlier in the day, according to Coach Kelly Graves, who added that Ionescu had not eaten much more than some crackers before the game. ""I don't know how many people that could have done what she did today,"" Graves told The Oregonian. ""That one was for him,"" she told ESPN. ""To do it on 2-24-20 was huge. I can't put it into words. He's looking down and proud of me and happy for this moment with my team."" Stephen Curry, another friend, watched from the baseline, attending an Oregon game for the second time in four days. Oregon is 26-2, ranked No. 3 and favored for another trip to the Final Four in Ionescu's final year. Many are projecting her as the top pick in the W.N.B.A. draft, a pick held by the New York Liberty."
26144,"Always Building, From the Garage to Her Company","Jeri Ellsworth started as a self-taught computer hacker and chip designer. In an industry dominated by men, she's the head of a company focusing on augmented reality.","Jeri Ellsworth at home in San Jose, Calif.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/multimedia/24SP-VIS-TECH-1/24SP-VIS-TECH-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=ac83b4769df7bba7eda97e78f7ecf9ac86232652b46a02e57f455893a947253b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/technology/jeri-ellsworth-augmented-reality.html,19fd33f9-0b59-588a-a7bc-abd2073baa39.jpg,"This article is part of a new series on Visionaries. The New York Times selected people from all over the world who are pushing the boundaries of their fields, from science and technology to culture and sports. Jeri Ellsworth began playing pinball when she worked in a bowling alley as a teenager, and a manager there would occasionally give her a few free credits. Today, she has a collection of more than 70 pinball machines , but her passion has moved from the mechanical into a new digital augmented reality, which she believes will be the future of entertainment. Ms. Ellsworth, 45 , is a self-taught computer hacker and chip designer who recently started a new augmented reality gaming company, Tilt Five , bas ed in San Jose, Calif . She is emblematic of a generation of Silicon Valley hobbyists who were passionate about computers and only later turned their passions into commercial enterprises. She originally gained visibility as an independent computer chip designer living in a rural ramshackle farmhouse in Yamhill, Ore . Ms. Ellsworth was able to squeeze the entire circuitry of a decades-old Commodore 64 home computer onto a single advanced silicon chip, which she then tucked neatly into a joystick that was connected by a cable to a TV set. Called the Commodore C64 Direct-to-TV, her device was able to run 30 video games , mostly sports, racing and puzzle games from the early 1980s, all without the hassle of changing game cartridges.

She was later hired by the gaming company Valve Software, to lead its research effort in augmented reality, technology that uses special glasses or holographic displays to superimpose three-dimensional objects and text on the physical world. In 2013 , she created castAR , a start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif. , to design an augmented reality company that planned to design a system to support desktop 3-D gaming . Ultimately, the company raised more than $1 million in a Kickstarter campaign, then gave the money back when it was unable to raise a second round of financing. With other castAR employees, Ms. Ellsworth acquired the original technology from investors and has used it to start Tilt Five , which has raised $1.3 million in Kickstarter funding. The following conversation has been edited and condensed. What would you like people to know about your work? I've always been passionate about making complete user experiences, whether that's for a kid's toy for a 12-year-old or something more professional, like, making sure it's got the complete package, that it's really easy to use on the physical side. It's got all the software and the interactions, and that's what I really get passionate about. And hopefully, people will remember that in my various things I've done.

What inspired you to go into your field? I don't know if there's one single person. I think an awesome role model for me was my father who was a really hard worker when I was a kid. And I saw him struggle to do his own business. So I think that's why I always lean toward doing my own thing instead of going and working for a monolithic company. But along the way, there's been lots of mentors. Getting to know, first from a distance, people like Steve Wozniak or Nolan Bushnell , whom I later met in person, or all these kind of famous early Silicon Valley folks. I'd like to be like them making these amazing products. So from afar, they inspired me, but to actually meet them later in life was really cool.

When you were growing up, what did you want to be? I wanted to be an astronaut. Yeah. I was really into space as a kid. At one point, I wanted to be a pilot and actually considered going into the Navy or the Air Force, to be a pilot. And my father talked me out of that. I was actually talking to recruiters and telling them , ""I want to fly."" And my dad said, ""you know what, they're going to figure out that you're really good with radios and computers and communications, and they're going to stick you in the bottom of a ship running radios."" And so yeah, who knows how it would have happened, but I veered off from that. ""I was just a young kid pulling heads off of engines and lapping valves and stuff.""

Did your dad run a service station when you were growing up? Yeah. He had me help him. I was maybe 12 years old, just old enough to be able to reach things under cars. He had me changing oil. I was just a young kid pulling heads off of engines and lapping valves and stuff. He didn't isolate me from any of that stuff, which was awesome. What obstacles have you faced in your field? There are lots of obstacles in Silicon Valley, especially for a female entrepreneur. The money that female entrepreneurs can raise is dismal compared to men. It's like 2 percent. It rewards the kind of male bravado where you go in and get a fist bump and get a bunch of money. That's how it feels. There's been some really disheartening surveys recently. They followed 300 women and 300 men, and then they determined, what questions do venture capitalists ask men versus women and men get asked, ""tell me all about the upside,"" while women are asked, ""tell me how you're going to defend yourself from the marauders."" And so that's been a bit of a challenge for me. How do you define success? I've done a lot of things in my life. And not many of them are public, and I think they've been successful. Some of them are just my mentoring and giving back. I don't get much recognition for some of these things. Sometimes it's the satisfaction of doing something that folks think will be impossible. So, I mean, a few years ago, I built semiconductors in my garage. I began doing research and people told me it would be impossible. They said you have to have clean rooms and millions of dollars of equipment and I decided I think I can do it in any case. I spent like five years researching. It was like a passion project, and then I did it.

How do you plan to change your field? Well, I'm super excited about augmented reality. I think it will be the next computing platform. I feel that we're at the point in history that maybe parallels the early home computers. Augmented reality in the next 20 years is really going to transform the way that we compute. We're going to be more intimately connected to the way we compute and these glasses or whatever technology comes along that does this kind of augmentation of our world is going to know probably more about us than we know about ourselves. And it's going to be this persistent improvement in our life because it will change the way we can interact with data, and the way we receive information. Where do you find your sources of creativity? I pull it in from all over the place. I'm a very curious person. Since I was a kid, I'd flip over rocks and just look at what was underneath. And so I think that even in my adult life, I'm constantly flipping over rocks. And so it can be almost anything, it can be an interesting optical phenomenon and I'll decide, I've got to understand what this strange phenomenon is. Or maybe some new electrical thing that I see. Or it could be on the art side, I do quite a few art projects. It all ties together and becomes a holistic approach I take to designing products. It's because I'm so curious in these different areas of science and arts and music. It helps me make better products. ""I've always been passionate about making complete user experiences, whether that's for a kid's toy for a 12-year-old or something more professional.""

How does technology interact with your profession? I have to stay up with it, and I try to always be as much on the leading edge of technology as possible. I have optics tables at home and I have plasma etchers. I even have holographic world combiners. I have all this stuff just right in my living room. I try to be fearless when it comes to technology, and I try to adopt it as fast as possible."
4470,"In a Pandemic, Do Doctors Still Have a Duty to Treat?","We have obligations as professionals — but also as husbands, wives, parents and children.",A doctor prepares to test a patient at a coronavirus drive-through testing center at Lehman College in New York City.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/opinion/02Jauhar/02Jauhar-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fe2082400bf4a6094f8f15467565091f84391ffa72e19694cf5a0524085d3a3d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-doctors-duty.html,e21e0e20-ff85-5fb3-aed1-e5101e3e1eac.jpg,"It is a question being asked in hospitals across the country: What is the duty to treat in a viral pandemic, particularly one in which health workers are getting infected and there is a dearth of personal protective equipment?

The question could be glibly dismissed. Medicine is a humanitarian profession, the argument would go. Health care workers have a duty to care for the sick. By freely entering into the profession, we have implicitly agreed to accept the risks.

Medical societies have generally been supportive of this idealistic viewpoint. The ethics manual of the American College of Physicians, for example, states that ""the ethical imperative for physicians to provide care"" overrides ""the risk to the treating physician, even during epidemics."" The American Medical Association asserts that ""individual physicians have an obligation to provide urgent medical care during disasters,"" emphasizing that this duty persists ""even in the face of greater than usual risks to physicians' own safety, health, or life.""

However, this argument seems to minimize the quandary my colleagues are facing as they try to balance their obligations as professionals with their duties as husbands, wives, parents and children. The risk to personal health from the coronavirus is alarming enough, but the risk of infecting our families because of exposure on the job is for some unacceptable. With the rates of infection among health workers so high -- nearly 14 percent of confirmed cases in Spain, for example -- the risk of transmission to our loved ones is not insignificant. How do we balance our professional and personal obligations?"

Not the 10-member MalPaso Dance Company, from Havana, which made its United States debut -- its first appearance outside Cuba -- on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. Founded less than two years ago by Osnel Delgado and Daile Carrazana Gonzalez, former members of Danza Contemporanea de Cuba, the company already has at least two knockout pieces: ""24 Hours and a Dog,"" created by Mr. Delgado, the artistic director, in collaboration with the dancers; and ""Why You Follow,"" a Joyce commission by New York's much-loved Ronald K. Brown.

A major draw of ""24 Hours"" is its original score by the Grammy-winning pianist and composer Arturo O'Farrill, who plays live at the Joyce (at all but two performances) with members of the Afro Latin Jazz Ensemble. His ripe, radiant, highly danceable composition gets going in darkness, which subsides when an urban skyline, roughly etched in white, imprints itself on the black backdrop. It's a generic but functional image, suggesting that what follows could be a day in the life of any city dweller, or at least the kind of young, agile, hustling city dwellers who populate Mr. Delgado's world.

Mr. Delgado, the first to appear, is at the center of that world, a searcher who gets swallowed up and spooled back out by ever-shifting constellations of his colleagues. His finely kneaded movement, which almost makes you want to grab it in fistfuls, buoys into and out of the ground with delectable ease. Appealing tensions arise from its casual pace set against the frenzied syncopations of the music, though at times the choreography feels frenzied, too, the stage overstuffed with good ideas."
44843,"How to Quit a Magazine, by Cindi Leive","After 16 years as editor in chief of Glamour, Cindi Leive is definitely not leaving her job to spend more time with her family.","Cindi Leive, the departing editor of Glamour, in her office at Condé Nast.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/17/fashion/17FOURTH2/17FOURTH2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=5d15ce494883f3893e3a7a587feda9a97339084017293a912856558108706bf6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/fashion/cindi-leive-glamour.html,826ae9fe-03bb-5a5e-b544-b5d86def2f51.jpg,"Cindi Leive, the editor in chief of Glamour, says that a writer has about three seconds to grab a reader's attention, so let's blurt this out: After 16 years, she says, she's quitting her job. This departure, one she announced to her staff this morning, makes her the fourth editor of a major magazine to vacate the role in the space of a week. In order of announcement, they are Graydon Carter of Vanity Fair, Roberta Myers of Elle and Nancy Gibbs of Time. ""As in all things magazine related, damn Graydon got there first,"" Ms. Leive said. She laughed and tucked her bare feet under her on the living room sofa in her Brooklyn townhouse. This was the day before she would inform Glamour's staff, and she was a little nervous about telling her team the news. ""I'm sure I will be, in my grandmother's words, 'highly verklempt.' I'm a bit of a crier anyway,"" she said. She refers to her staff as her ""Glam fam"": ""I just love love love the people I work with,"" she said. Her toenails were painted a bluish gray. They looked perfectly nice but still ready for a fresh pedicure. She will stay on at the magazine until the end of the year, but soon she'll have the time for primping.

As every magazine editor knows, three is a trend. So what to make of four? Ms. Leive's departure from Glamour would matter in any circumstance. Coming now, it cements a sudden sense that there is an unprecedented change of the guard. Ms. Leive was among a now fairly thin rank of those who were magazine editors before magazines became brands. ""To me, a brand was Kellogg's,"" she said of her early days. ""But I have gotten comfortable with the term."" Like any media executive worth her six-figure Twitter following, Ms. Leive is proud to share today's measure of magazine success: 11 million monthly unique visitors to Glamour.com, 15 million followers across social media platforms, a robust ""Women of the Year"" award ceremony and events business, a video that has garnered 147 million views on Facebook. It's called ""Your Period in 2 Minutes."" ""Perhaps you saw it?"" she asked. Ms. Leive's stomach growled beneath her flouncy Tanya Taylor dress, with its cutout shoulders. She drank water. ""I'm leaving the brand in great shape,"" she said. The least vague reason she would offer for her decision to quit now related to her mother, a biochemist who died when Ms. Leive was 19. ""Not to get too emo, but my mom died when she was 49 and last year I turned 49,"" she said, and here, her voice got wobbly. ""I felt like I have been given this gift of so much more life and I wanted to do something with it.""

She wouldn't comment on what her next gig will be other than to say what it won't be: ""I'm not going to another big media job or to a similar position at another company."" She gave the impression that she has plans. ""I adore my kids, but I'm not leaving to spend more time with my kids,"" she said. Ms. Leive and her husband, Howard Bernstein, a film producer, have two children, Lucy, 14, and Ike, 12. They needed some reassurance that their mother leaving her job is a good idea. ""When I told this to my son, his main concern was, 'Oh my God, are you not going to be verified on Instagram anymore?'"" she said. She too was captivated by a certain idea of status when she was younger. While a college student, Ms. Leive was an intern at The Paris Review, working out of its old basement offices. She saw herself studying for a Ph.D. and getting a job that would be, as she put it, ""Important with a capital I."" After graduating from Swarthmore College when she was 21, she allowed herself a one-year frivolity, a job at a fashion magazine. But then something unexpected happened. She found that she loved being an editorial assistant at Glamour, loved the mix of fashion and politics, civics and silliness. She stayed for 11 years. ""The type of things they were writing and editing,"" she said of Glamour's more senior staff, ""were the things me and my friends were talking about."" She loved working for Ruth Whitney, Glamour's editor of 31 years. She even loved working for Bonnie Fuller, the less refined, more sex- and celebrity-focused replacement to Ms. Whitney. (She says the ""three second"" attention rule is a Bonnieism.) After working for Ms. Fuller for less than a year, she became the editor of Self, also published by Conde Nast.

When Ms. Fuller was asked to resign in 2001, Ms. Leive returned to Glamour, as its editor in chief. Even though she had been at Glamour for years before, and also had two years as editor of Self under her belt, there was a steep learning curve. Early in her tenure, she promised a celebrity that she could have approval over her appearance on the cover. ""It was someone I greatly admired,"" Ms. Leive said. Ms. Leive selected the photograph that she knew was the right one for the magazine's demographic and newsstand appeal. The actress hated it. Ms. Leive tried to persuade her that it was a flattering picture, but the actress wouldn't budge and Ms. Leive worried about making the celebrity unhappy. She didn't want Glamour to get a bad reputation with Hollywood publicists. But she was positive that she had selected the right photo. ""At a certain point in the interaction, I had to let go of this desire to make this person like me and remind myself that my allegiance was with Glamour and with what I thought was the right cover,"" she said. ""So I just went for it and said, 'I'm sorry but this is the cover we're going to run.'"" Ms. Leive said the actress took it in stride and that she never again offered anyone cover approval. Figuring out how to leverage the internet wasn't easy, either. ""I had what I thought was the most brilliant idea,"" she said of a notion that occurred to her around 2010. Glamour could use its famous ""Dos and Don'ts"" rubric to encourage readers to submit photographs of people wearing the good or the ugly. Visitors to the website would be encouraged to weigh in. There was a huge influx of traffic, Ms. Leive said, but not just that. ""I actually opened Pandora's box for a troll convention to take place on Glamour.com,"" she said. She and her staff decided to hit delete. She also learned that not every story she thought was splashy would actually make a splash. For the July 2015 issue, Kim Kardashian West appeared on the cover of Glamour, addressing publicly her feelings about the gender transition of her family member Caitlyn Jenner. Ms. Leive and her staff planned a full press rollout.

""Literally an hour before we were putting it out, Vanity Fair's Caitlyn Jenner cover comes out,"" Ms. Leive said. ""So my scoop didn't look that great, and all of a sudden I was getting angry letters from people wanting to know why I was referring to Caitlyn Jenner as Bruce in the magazine."" She laughed, sounding amused and still a little exasperated. There is much from her long tenure that makes Ms. Leive proud, she said. There is the ""Women of the Year"" awards, which have honored people including Malala Yousafzai and Gabby Giffords. Ms. Leive oversaw the launch of the Girl Project, which provides resources to support education for girls in more than 100 countries. She published an essay last summer by Barack Obama, called ""This Is What a Feminist Looks Like."" She also made Hillary Clinton the first presidential candidate to be endorsed by Glamour. Ms. Leive says Anna Wintour, Conde Nast's artistic director and Ms. Leive's boss, deserves much of the credit for that. When Ms. Leive broached the idea with her, she said that Ms. Wintour said, ""If you think this is what is right for your audience and for women, then you should do it."" All this is why Ms. Leive bristles at the suggestion that her decision to leave magazines, amid something that is approaching a brain drain of longtime magazine honchos, signals that glossies are losing their sheen. Not that she's complaining about being in the company of Ms. Myers, Ms. Gibbs and Mr. Carter. ""That's a pretty nice outgoing class to be in, I'll take it,"" she said. ""We can all hang out in the corner booth somewhere."" Only if a former editor in chief can still snag the corner booth, she is reminded. ""What if I can't get a corner booth anymore, good point!"" she said, and cracked up. ""We'll have to meet on my back deck, fending off the dog."""
57091,South Korean Executive Imprisoned,"The court's decision to have Chey Tae-won, 53, detained and dispatched to prison from the courtroom, pending his appeal, was highly unusual in South Korea.","Chey Tae-won, the chairman of SK Group, was detained immediately after being sentenced to four years in prison.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/01/business/Embezzle/Embezzle-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=368&w=600&s=5773bfd542aad15558e3b5fcc24a29e8c1b79299e213668f44fe53f5bbd9da28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/global/01iht-embezzle01.html,d64bddd9-5812-5669-9f44-61861e6a5476.jpg,"SEOUL -- The head of SK, one of the largest South Korean conglomerates and owner of the country's biggest mobile carrier and oil refiner, was arrested in a Seoul courtroom Thursday after he was sentenced to four years in prison for embezzlement. The court's decision to have Chey Tae-won, 53, detained and dispatched to prison from the courtroom, pending his appeal, was highly unusual in South Korea, where judges are known for being lenient to powerful tycoons convicted of white-collar crimes. Until recently, such tycoons rarely spent any time in prison, as courts most often not only did not arrest them but also suspended their prison terms, citing their ""contribution to the economy"" and fears that their absence from management might hurt their corporate empires, and by extension, the national economy. Mr. Chey was convicted of embezzling 49.7 billion won, or $45.6 million, from the mobile phone company SK Telecom and an SK subsidiary, SK C&C, in 2008. SK is the third-largest South Korean corporation by assets, after Samsung and Hyundai.

""I didn't do it,"" he said in the court. ""I only learned about this in 2010, and that's all I can say."" South Korean courts' attitude toward white-collar crimes is changing amid public calls for ""economic democratization."" During the presidential campaign in December, all of the main candidates, including Park Geun-hye, now president-elect, championed the catchphrase. They vowed to stop conglomerates from hurting smaller businesses through unfair practices, fight widening income disparity and ensure that tycoons convicted of corruption were punished.

Last February, Lee Ho-jin, the chairman of a relatively minor conglomerate called Taekwang, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for embezzlement and was immediately jailed. In August, a Seoul court sentenced Kim Seung-youn, head of the Hanwha conglomerate, to four years in prison for embezzlement and sent him directly to prison from the courtroom. (Mr. Kim was paroled this month when a court ruled his illness was serious enough for hospitalization.) Mr. Chey is the most prominent tycoon yet to have faced the tougher sentences being imposed by courts. This is the second time he has been ordered imprisoned for corruption. In 2003, he was arrested on charges of bookkeeping fraud, but his prison term was suspended, and he was released.

""He used the subsidiaries under his control as a tool for his crime,"" the presiding judge, Lee Won-beom, said Thursday. ""We had to face our duty to deal sternly with his crime before considering leniency."" Former President Park Chung-hee, the father of Ms. Park, the president-elect, nurtured a handful of family-controlled businesses with easy credit, subsidies, tax benefits and protection from foreign competitors during his rule in the 1960s and '70s. They soon grew into the conglomerates, known locally as chaebol, and led South Korea's rapid economic growth. Today, the country's 10 biggest conglomerates, most in the third generation of family control, make up more than half the value of the companies traded on the Korea Stock Exchange. But the conglomerates have also faced repeated accusations of bribery, poor corporate governance and shady deals, often to help the families of their chairmen accumulate wealth. The heads of seven of the country's top 10 conglomerates, including Lee Kun-hee, chairman of Samsung Electronics, and Chung Mong-koo, chairman of Hyundai Automotive, have been convicted of crimes like bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion. But none spent more than a few months behind bars, as their sentences, usually three years in prison, were quickly suspended by judges and their criminal records erased in presidential pardons. ""We fear that the guilty verdict against Chairman Chey Tae-won may further stoke the anti-business sentiment widespread in parts of our society,"" the Federation of Korean Industries, which speaks for big businesses, said in a news release Thursday. Solidarity for Economic Reform, a civic chaebol watchdog, noted that four years in prison for Mr. Chey was hardly a tough punishment. Acknowledging widespread discontent, the Supreme Court recently recommended that a businessman convicted of embezzling about 30 billion won be sentenced to at least four years in prison. By law, a prison term of more than three years cannot be suspended. ""Today's verdict is positive in that it broke the old pattern of giving a suspended three years' prison term, but it still is the minimum punishment under the current guidelines by the Supreme Court,"" the civic group said in a statement. ""Our courts have two faces when it comes to punishing chaebol."""

The concluding section on theology contains some likely less familiar names -- Hermann Cohen, Joseph Soloveitchik, Judith Plaskow -- but I'm here with my Ph.D. to tell you that they would raise no eyebrows on an ""Introduction to Jewish Studies"" syllabus.

Kirsch's essays are expertly made, each one deftly including just enough historical context, healthy portions of summary and exposition, and the lightest sprinkling of interpretation and evaluation. He says just enough to make the value of a book clear, without too many spoilers, and he doesn't go on too long or belabor his points. The essays could serve as models for anyone asked to write the introduction for a new paperback edition of a well-worn text.

Along the way, Kirsch covers major topics and concepts in modern Jewish history, anti-Semitism and exile and immigration and genocide and so on, and he quotes an anthology's worth of key lines and slogans. ""Someone must have slandered Joseph K., for one morning, without having done anything wrong, he was arrested"" (Kafka); ""My heart, stained crimson with murder, squeaked and overflowed"" (Babel's ""My First Goose""); ""If you will it, it is no dream"" (Theodor Herzl); ""I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart"" (Anne Frank); ""I am an American, Chicago-born"" (Bellow's ""The Adventures of Augie March""). In some cases, Kirsch adds an important gloss -- Frank's line ""in context ... sounds almost desperate, something she says not because it's true but because she needs to believe it,"" Kirsch insightfully notes -- but often he's simply recalling for his audience a quotable quote.

Kirsch offers for each book a crystal-clear and eloquently phrased summation that no intelligent reader could disagree with. What Wiesel's ""Night"" ""wants to communicate about the Holocaust"" is that ""afterward ... the world can never be the same."" For Anzia Yezierska, author of the classic novel ""Bread Givers"" (1925), ""the Jewish past"" is ""a combination of inspiration and burden."" Amos Oz's early stories about kibbutz residents suggest that ""the qualities of toughness and overbearing confidence that built up the State of Israel might also end up dooming it."" Yes, yes, it's all true -- who would argue?

Readers who will appreciate the accessibility and clarity of these essays will also be relieved to discover that Kirsch has kept at bay any trappings of academic literary scholarship (citations, notes). Experts, on the other hand, might notice that Kirsch often errs when he says something was the ""first"" of its kind. They might be peeved when he promulgates a myth, thoroughly debunked by the historian Hasia Diner, that the Holocaust was, for a decade and a half after the end of World War II, an ""unprocessed trauma,"" and that ""it took American Jewry a generation to begin to come to terms with it."" Speakers of many languages -- who may notice that of the famous lines above, only one was composed in English -- might also be annoyed that while Kirsch acknowledges Jews' literary multilingualism, he never delves into the complexities of translating from Russian, German, Yiddish, Hebrew and other languages."

44409,How to Help Kids Disrupt 'Bro Culture',"When it comes to toxic behavior, social media is part of both the problem and the solution.",Social media is both part of the problem and the solution.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/15/well/family/well-family-bros/well-family-bros-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b40d70808df0636c1d389dbd2b7202d28302ab39114d1c03779a1f794357bdd2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/well/family/how-to-help-kids-disrupt-bro-culture.html,1bddf7c2-c8e1-5c9c-83aa-000a923c64cb.jpg,"When women in the tech industry came forward recently with accounts of sexual harassment and assault, their reports exposed the harmful underbelly of a strain of toxic behavior that has come to be known as ""bro culture."" Over the past few years, the term has become a label for the dangerous normalization of sexual objectification, harassment, assault and homophobia. Bro culture uses the formidable elixirs of power and status to create a toxic social environment, and tends to be characterized by manipulative charm, entitlement and a so-called ""rules don't apply attitude"" -- as well as an inability to express emotion, show remorse or be vulnerable. Although the culture is typically associated with college fraternity life, evidence suggests that its seeds are planted in elementary school or earlier. The ways we talk to and interact with boys -- the language we use, potentially celebrating masculinity at the expense of empathy -- can limit boys' social and emotional development. How can adults help break the pattern? Listening to how boys talk about others in the company of their friends is a start. The role of fathers, father figures, and other adult male role models -- including coaches, teachers and school administrators -- can be crucially important in counteracting media and other cultural messages, said Kevin Kruger, president of NASPA, the national association for student affairs administrators at colleges and universities.

Social media is part of both the problem and the solution. Photos, messages and videos sent via Snapchat, Facebook messenger and other popular apps now regularly expose incriminating behavior and help put bro culture on notice. But social media can also feed the growth of bro culture, because communicating through a screen can make interactions -- such as adolescents and teenagers pressuring one another to send nudes, sharing private photos and messages -- seem more transactional than real-life relationships and thwart social and emotional growth. Furthermore, a lack of comprehensive sex education focused on healthy sexuality, consent and overall well-being can send middle and high school students to their smartphones and, more specifically, online pornography for sex ed. Though few research studies have examined the impact of online pornography on teen relationships, some teenagers misinterpret explicit images that are increasingly demeaning and violent toward women as examples of intimacy. In her 2016 book ""Girls & Sex,"" the journalist Peggy Orenstein cites a 2010 study that analyzed 304 scenes from popular porn videos and found that nearly 90 percent of the scenes included physical aggression and almost half had some form of verbal abuse, with women overwhelmingly the targets of aggression. It's unlikely that many parents want violent, aggressive images to be part of their children's formative ideas about sex. Programs that work to promote healthy sexuality, communication, consent and responsibility are crucial because even students who want to talk about relationships and sex might not know how. One such program, Our Whole Lives, works to meet or exceed national standards for sex education core curriculum for kindergarten through 12th grade. It provides age-appropriate exercises focused on promoting self-worth, sexual health, responsibility, and inclusivity and justice. The program, created in a collaboration between the Unitarian Universalist Association and United Church of Christ, offers both a secular curriculum for use by public schools and organizations, and additional tools to help facilitators put teachings in the context of religious values if they so choose.

Another resource, Peer Health Exchange, trains college student volunteers to help fill the gap for mental and sexual health education in under-resourced high schools around the country. Since its founding in 2003, the organization has trained 8,500 college students to provide culturally relevant, medically appropriate health education to over 115,000 public high school students. Louise Langheier, its co-founder and chief executive, said that talking with young people about consent can help them confront issues around bro culture. GLSEN, a national organization focused on creating a safer school climate for all students, provides educational materials and resources to encourage greater conversations around lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning students, who can also be bullied or targeted. Its ThinkB4YouSpeak lesson plan provides exercises to help students understand the impact behind homophobic slurs that can be used in bro culture, and guides students on how to move from being a bystander to being an ally when they witness hateful or discriminatory behavior. And a study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in May found that schools that used a violence prevention program called Green Dot had more than a 50 percent reduction in the self-reported frequency of sexual violence by high school students. For the study, the University of Kentucky researcher Ann Coker and her team looked at the results of nearly 90,000 student surveys at 26 Kentucky high schools from 2010 to 2014. The program works with students to shift responsibility from victims to bystanders. Teaching young people that members of a community look out for one another may help reduce the spread of bro culture. Years of working with teenagers and young adults has taught me that bro culture develops out of a social and emotional insecurity that uses a group dynamic as a safety blanket and excessive drinking and partying as a shield. Youth sports, once thought of as a critical tool for developing key social and emotional skills, may also inadvertently contribute to bro culture. A 2013 review article published in the Journal of Sports Medicine suggested that early and excessive emphasis on youth sports and early sport specialization - or participating in one sport year-round - can shift youth focus from fun or ""deliberate play"" to performance and has been linked to increased psychosocial problems, antisocial behaviors and negative peer interactions. ""When you have young athletes who at very young ages are identified as special, as unique, as having a particular kind of talent that very few people have access to,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, professor and founding director of the Center for Arts, Digital Culture and Entrepreneurship at Duke University. ""They are granted a certain level of entitlement because of that -- what kinds of classes they get to miss, what kind of opportunities to travel they get -- all of this gets embodied into this notion of bro culture."""

You can't always live comfortably with his eccentric furniture, but you can't write the history of late 20th-century art without it. On the 100th anniversary of his birth and only a decade since his death, in 2007, the Milanese maestro best known for his red Olivetti portable typewriter and as the guru of the revolutionary postmodern design group Memphis remains a magnificent irritant and an exemplar of originality.

The largest Sottsass show staged in a New York museum, and one of a celebratory crop for the centenary, it provides a broad picture of the origins of this architect/designer and of Memphis itself that few are familiar with. It details his influences and inspirations with artifacts from Egyptian, Indian and other non-Western cultures; examples of European and American modernism, as well as designs by Sottsass's Memphis contemporaries (especially Peter Shire and Shiro Kuramata) and also some acolytes, misguided and not.

This effort has been organized seemingly on the fly by Christian Larsen, who arrived as the Met's associate curator of modern design and decorative arts only 18 months ago. Unusual for a show of this size and ambition, there is no catalog, although Mr. Larsen does his best to compensate with expert labels and several short, effective slide shows. But excepting architecture, this is a fairly complete Sottsass sampler: furniture, decorative objects, textiles, office machinery and jewelry and, of course, the idiosyncratic laminates so important to the indelible Memphis look. My favorite is Bacterio, a combination of little black squiggles on white that sheaths a 1979 proto-Memphis cabinet for Studio Alchymia and is completed by a windowed door, three fluorescent lights and lunar-module feet. Born in 1917 in Innsbruck, Austria, Sottsass teethed in proximity to one of the founts of modernism as the devoted son of Ettore Sottsass Sr., an architect who trained in Vienna when its design ethic was steeped in the grids and geometries of Otto Wagner and his brilliant student Josef Hoffmann, a founder in 1903 of the Wiener Werkstatte. (Junior would also be inspired by the Bauhaus, modernism's second front.)

His father moved the family to Turin and after World War II, in Italy's frenzy of Marshall Plan rebuilding, father and son collaborated on designs for low-cost housing and schools that were inspired by the varied structures and materials of small Italian villages. Their work is postmodernism in embryo and a veritable template for the 1989 house in Ridgway, Colo., that Sottsass designed for Daniel Wolf, an art collector and dealer, that is seen here in drawings and a slide show.

During his 60-year career, Sottsass Jr. designed office systems (including the shell of the Olivetti mainframe computer, from 1957 to 1959) and systems for simplified living, as well, that were intended to discourage consumption. His Superbox, for example, designed in 1966, was an outhouse-proportioned wardrobe with a surface of plastic laminates of the buyer's choice -- had it been produced. It stands out from the wall like one of Anne Truitt's painted Minimalist plinths. Complete with its own pedestal that ignored the Minimalist practice, while also complicating its use, it was intended to hold all your carefully winnowed belongings. His experimental Environment units similarly compressed the basic household functions (cooking, sleeping, bathing) into mobile modular cabinets that would link together for moving. At least in theory. They never got beyond the maquette stage and are present here only in a 1972 film that Sottsass made with Massimo Magri, and two excellent drawings.

But he also had an obsession with handcrafted glass and especially ceramics, fed by his many trips to India. A grove of Sottsass's looming ceramic totems, built from cylinders glazed in many colors, are in a gallery painted marigold yellow, alongside tiny Indian stupas with similarly stacked structures. The remaining Sottsass ceramics here mostly lose out to the antiquities, except for the more delicate, Deco-like black-and-silver vases of the Tenebre (Darkness) series from 1963. Initially a devotee of modernism, Sottsass designed one of its postwar classics: the Olivetti manual typewriter of 1968, intoxicatingly bright and enshrined in the Museum of Modern Art by 1969. Its form-follows-function economy is articulated by its magnetic color, but it was eventually cursed by its creator for overshadowing his other achievements (in an expletive probably never before seen in a Met wall text). But Memphis seems to have been in Sottsass's blood. Even before the Olivetti typewriter, he was intimating a sundering of modernism's form-function credo, as evidenced by two towerlike cabinets from the early- and mid-1960s in the show's first, dense gallery. Enlarging the Viennese grid seen nearby in designs by Hoffmann and Kolomon Moser, they attest to an inborn preference for bright color, combined materials and bold, subtly humorous scale.

Sottsass's apostasy culminated in the exuberant wildness of his Memphis furniture, with its angled forms, Fiestaware hues, enlarged faux-wood grains and startling modern laminates. The design group took its name from the cities in Tennessee and ancient Egypt and the Bob Dylan song ""Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again,"" which played repeatedly during its first meeting in 1981. Later that year, Memphis caused a furor at the annual Salone del Mobile, Milan's revered Italian furniture fair, unapologetically infecting design with postmodernism's skeptical mixing of styles, symbols and emotional content. Karl Lagerfeld bought many of the Memphis prototypes for his Monaco apartment and -- well, the rest is history. (The pieces ultimately were priced too high for average consumers and became symbols of '80s excess.) For better and for worse, Sottsass's influence still ripples through contemporary design. The Met's insistence on mixing and matching, always pushing the relevance of its vast holdings to more contemporary developments, may become a tick. (It certainly diluted the recent show of Marsden Hartley's Maine paintings.) Mr. Larsen's add-ons here are usually effective and they point up a strength of this tactic: singling out historical works you might otherwise have missed in the flow of the collection galleries, like the terrific little painted-wood reliquary from New Kingdom Egypt that resembles a Romanesque chapel. Some add-ons feel superfluous, including overexposed works by Roy Lichtenstein and Frank Stella. The Met's exceptional 1964 canvas by the Abstract Expressionist Adolph Gottlieb serves mostly to make the show's single Sottsass painting look bad. Some indication of Sottsass Sr.'s work, or his collaborations with his son, seem in order, as does the inclusion of relevant non-Memphis legends like Joe Colombo and Gaetano Pesce. Mr. Larsen has some revelatory decoy maneuvers. A black-and-white cane armchair from 1903 by Hoffmann and Moser is accompanied by what initially appears to be a Werkstatte oddity but is actually a wood planter that Sottsass designed in 1961, more straightforward and less refined. One of the best juxtapositions is a vitrine that alternates three Sottsass glass objects with three kachina figures by unrecorded Hopi artists whose colorful geometric forms clearly relate. And the kachinas come racing back to mind in one of the high points in the show's final gallery: the akimbo, symmetrical semaphore of Sottsass's Carlton Room Divider, a standout from the 1981 Milan furniture fair. Here Sottsass, as in his other Memphis pieces, achieves a new friction between form and function, while slyly merging painting, sculpture and furniture with the spirit of architecture. The not-always-pertinent non-Sottsass material means that this exhibition sometimes feels padded. Sottsass could easily have filled the space at the Met Breuer if there had been more lead time. Nonetheless, it provides an invaluable introduction to his complex, resonating achievement."
1062,Hubris on the Campaign Trail,Mike Bloomberg is playing true to type.,"Mike Bloomberg at a campaign event in Oakland, Calif.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/24/opinion/24bloombergWeb/24bloombergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c72a9990caf8e5d1e09c444da3a945e07bb164bd4c9a66bb6fcce8cef66d2959&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/michael-bloomberg-campaign.html,11507eda-36d8-5c53-b9b5-d087b2f300d6.jpg,"In 2008, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was barred by term limits from seeking four more years in office. So he got rid of the law and then spent more than $100 million of his fortune to win a third term the next year. New Yorkers were raving mad. But they re-elected him anyway. ""I feel he bought himself the election,"" Stav Birnbaum of Brooklyn told The Times in 2009, after voting for Mr. Bloomberg. But she added, ""He's doing a really good job."" Mr. Bloomberg has rarely paid a political price for breaking the rules. He is protected in part because of his reputation as one of New York's most effective mayors.

And in part because of his enormous fortune. Now, as Mr. Bloomberg campaigns for president, his disdain for convention is once again on display, most obviously in the more than $200 million in advertising that has helped him rise in the polls while participating in neither the Democratic debates nor early primary contests. He has also asked for, and been granted, approval from the Federal Election Commission to delay release of his personal financial disclosures. The extension -- Mr. Bloomberg's second such reprieve -- is particularly convenient because it means he won't be required to make public his extensive financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest until after Super Tuesday, when Democrats in 14 states and American Samoa will hold primaries and caucuses. Mr. Bloomberg has put his billions to good use, generously supporting public health and gun safety campaigns, as well as efforts to combat climate change. And money devoted to defeating President Trump is money well spent. Mr. Bloomberg has said that if his own candidacy fails, he is willing to spend $1 billion to back the Democratic nominee, even if it is someone with whom he has substantial policy disagreements. All that is to be applauded. But some other aspects of Mr. Bloomberg's campaign need to change. Most concerning, he has misstated his record on stop-and-frisk, the policing tactic that humiliated hundreds of thousands of innocent New Yorkers, overwhelmingly young black and Latino men. ""Now as all of you know, in my determination to reduce gun violence, we employed a common big-city police practice called stop-and-frisk, and that resulted in far too many innocent people being stopped,"" Mr. Bloomberg said in a speech in Tulsa, Okla., on Jan. 19. ""And when I realized that, we took action.""

Not quite. The number of stops rose for years under Mr. Bloomberg, peaking at 685,724 stops in 2011, according to police data published by the New York Civil Liberties Union. Though it was down slightly the next year to 532,911, it began to significantly decline only in 2013, the year a federal judge ruled the city's use of the policing strategy unconstitutional. Throughout his mayoralty, and for years afterward, Mr. Bloomberg fiercely defended the policy, insisting it was saving lives, even though nearly 90 percent of the stops resulted in no charges, and crime continued to fall even after the number of stops sharply declined. He apologized just before announcing his intention to run for the Democratic nomination, a contest nearly impossible to win without robust support from black voters. This wasn't the first time he's mischaracterized his record on the issue. ""Nobody asked me about it until I started running for president. So come on,"" he said of stop-and-frisk in an interview with Gayle King of CBS in December, weeks after apologizing for the use of the practice in a speech at a predominantly black church in Brooklyn. That will be news to many New Yorkers, starting with the groups that sued the city over the policy, and the dozens of reporters in New York who pressed him on it for years. Mr. Bloomberg has also declined to release from confidentiality agreements several women who brought accusations of a hostile work environment at his company, Bloomberg L.P. Mr. Bloomberg has much to offer. But some honesty and humility would go a long way. The last thing America needs is another rich guy who thinks the rules are for suckers."
28552,"Pay Down Those Credit Cards, Before Rates Rise Further","With the holidays behind us, now is the moment to wipe out balances — before interest rates continue their climb.","Americans' amount of revolving credit, made up mostly of credit card debt, hit a record in November: $1.023 trillion.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/business/13ADVISER1/12ADVISER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=7d519c63009e60a9b0e2930a74d65300ca445538fcffed3173a1acc75dd2333c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/your-money/credit-cards-debt.html,c2929008-2209-5c96-bfae-2b48f6483575.jpg,"How to avoid trouble? For starters, stop adding to your card balance except for emergencies, and seek better terms. ""There's nothing wrong with calling your card issuer to see if you can get a lower rate,"" said Bill Hardekopf, chief executive of the card website LowCards.com. He suggests borrowers check their credit report before calling, so they know what kind of a rate they might reasonably expect. And, he advises, ""be polite.""

Cutting back on card charges isn't always easy to do. Julie Ford, a fee-only financial planner in New York City who works with clients in their 20s and 30s, said young adults in big cities could get carried away with lifestyle spending and lose track of their budgets amid social pressure to keep up. ""That super-expensive gym membership becomes normalized,"" she said.

January is a good time for consumers to peruse credit card statements and consider what's really necessary, Ms. Ford said. She urges clients to consider why they got into debt in the first place -- was it a one-time medical expense or emergency, or is it a more persistent problem of living beyond their means?

If it's continuous overspending, Ms. Ford suggests clients put off wardrobe updates and suspend those gym memberships, perhaps switching temporarily to jogging. The extra cash can go toward their card balances. Most of her clients are able to pay off the debt within a year. ""I tell them, 'This isn't forever,'"" she said.

Lauren Zangardi Haynes, a fee-only planner with Evolution Advisers in Midlothian, Va., suggests setting spending limits for any discretionary items to manage card spending. For instance, she said, she cooks at home frequently and enjoys serving wine with meals. So she established a monthly budget for wine, and makes a trip each month to buy it all at once; when the wine is gone, that's it until the next month. Buying wine in bulk means ""you get a lot of strange looks,"" she said, but helps keep a lid on ""budget bleed."""

The sudden end to negotiations upended a way of doing business that had been in place for more than four decades. The fight had been brewing for a year. The Writers Guild of America's Los Angeles and New York branches accused the agents of enriching themselves at their clients' expense and demanded that they agree to a new code of conduct. If the agents believed that the movie and television writers' threat to break the bond between them was a mere negotiating ploy, they learned it was a genuine stance when the talks fizzled out late Friday afternoon. The Association of Talent Agents, the group representing the major agencies, offered concessions in recent days, but their efforts were not enough to keep the two sides at the table.

In an email blast sent to its members at the end of the failed talks, the Writers Guild of America said, ""There is no settlement.""

The Association of Talent Agents said in a statement released at the end of talks that the planned mass firing ""will hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to midlevel and emerging writers."" The statement continued: ""The W.G.A. leadership today declared a pathway for compromise doesn't exist. Agencies have been committed to reaching an agreement with the W.G.A., but, despite our best efforts, today's outcome was driven by the Guild's predetermined course for chaos.""

The TV writers and agents had been operating under a franchise agreement that took effect in 1976. That agreement was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, when the Writers Guild of America would technically break ties with every agency that had not signed the new code of conduct. The four major agencies -- William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and ICM Partners -- had been steadfast in shunning the writers' attempt to make serious changes to the structure that has long been in place. The fight made for an unusual labor battle. The writers' unions, which went on strike in 2007 and nearly did so again two years ago, have traditionally had disputes with their bosses at the big studios. This time, they have directed their fury with the people who have served as their advocates and friends. During a programming boom often referred to as Peak TV -- 495 shows were available in the United States last year, thanks in part to the rise of streaming -- television writers have claimed that their pay is stagnant or going down. The writers blame what they perceive as insufficient compensation on the agencies, accusing them of corrupt business practices. Two specific practices have gnawed at television writers. One is the agents' decades-old habit of packaging a roster of talent from their pool of clients for a given project. In return, the agencies waive the usual 10 percent commission fee paid to them by individual clients and collect large sums, called packaging fees, from the studios. The writers claim that these deals allow the agents to effectively pocket money that should be theirs. The writers' second complaint concerns how three of the major agencies -- William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists and the United Talent -- have ventured into the production business with the creation of affiliated companies that produce and own content. This development, the writers say, can mean that agents sit across the table from executives who are essentially their colleagues in what the unions call a conflict of interest. The agencies have called the writers' claims preposterous, arguing that their services are needed more than ever in a changing media environment in which Netflix, Amazon and Apple are on the rise.

The writers have been adamant that the agencies must end the practices they find objectionable, which the code of conduct would accomplish. Last month, 7,882 members of the Writers Guild of America West and the Writers Guild of America East voted in favor of the new code of conduct, with just 392 members voting nay. The rupture between the writers and their agents will introduce disorder to Hollywood. The industry is approaching the so-called staffing season, when the broadcast networks assemble their fall lineups and hire writers to bang out telescripts for sitcoms and police procedurals. Agents are the usual go-betweens for the writers and studios, taking a strong hand in matching writers rooms with the appropriate writers. Union bosses have in recent days told writers that they would be able to apply for jobs through a web portal set up by the Writers Guild of America, or by empowering their managers or lawyers to make deals on their behalf. The agents have warned the writers against allowing managers or lawyers to do that kind of work. On Friday morning, Latham & Watkins, a law firm representing the talent agents, sent a letter to the union, saying it was ""unlawful"" in California and New York for managers and lawyers to take on the role of agents. The note also suggested that litigation could soon be filed in both directions. There were hints of the coming impasse on Thursday evening after the Association of Talent Agents went public with its counterproposals to the writers. Some people in Hollywood interpreted the association's unusual step of revealing what had been happening during closed-door negotiations as a sign that the two sides were nowhere near a deal. With their counterproposals on Thursday, the agencies suggested that they wanted to continue with packaging and running their own affiliated production programs, but they were willing to make their practices more transparent. For shows with packaging arrangements, the agencies said they would share ""a percentage"" of their back-end profits with writers. More specifically, the agents said 80 percent of that share would be funneled toward writers who did not participate in profits on the series. The remaining 20 percent would go toward initiatives meant to improve diversity in writers' rooms.

On the production affiliate programs, the agents vowed to be more transparent and to meet with writers four times a year to discuss whether a show made with agencies' sibling companies was ""benefiting writers."" After two years, according to the counterproposal, if the unions continued to believe that writers were not doing well under the arrangement, they would have the right to reopen negotiations on the matter. The writers unions found both offers unsatisfactory. David Goodman, the president of the West branch, said that the revised packaging offer was ""not a serious proposal"" and that the production affiliate offer was ""unacceptable."" Many bystanders -- studio executives and producers -- have likened the writers' strategy to Brexit: unyielding, but where will it lead? ""We will not only stand together, we will stand up for each other, lean on each other,"" the unions said on Friday. ""We can do this."""

I'm the director of ""Joker."" So this scene is interesting because it's right after a life-changing cataclysmic event in Arthur's life, and he's found this little kind of rundown park bathroom to go in and collect his thoughts and get himself together. What's interesting about this scene to me is it's entirely different than what we had scripted. In the script, Arthur was to come into the bathroom, hide his gun, wash off his makeup, and staring at himself in the mirror like what have I done. And when we got to the set on the day, Joaquin and I just sort of stood around like, this doesn't really seem very Arthur. Why would Arthur care to hide his gun? And we really kind of tossed around a million ways to just do something different. And it was about an hour into it and I said, hey, you know, I got this piece of music from Hildur. Hildur Gudnadottir is our composer, and she'd been sending me music throughout, while we were shooting. And I just wanted to play Joaquin this piece of music. And Joaquin just started to dance to the music, and it was just me and him alone in the bathroom. There's 250 people on the crew waiting outside. And he just starts doing this dance, and we both kind of look at each other and said, O.K., that's the scene. It made sense to us because when I first met with Joaquin and we first started talking about ""Joker,"" I talked to him that Arthur is one of those people that has music in him. So music and dance became a theme in the film. And this is the second time we see him dancing, and it's a little bit of Joker coming out, a little bit more than the scene before and a little bit less than the next time we see him dance.

For millions of years, the ancestors of the regal T. rex were relegated to second-class predator status while a different dinosaur dynasty ruled over what is now North America: towering allosaurs.

But the allosaurs went extinct during the late Cretaceous, allowing tyrannosaurs to seize the throne and then evolve into large killing machines like T. rex and Tarbosaurus.

To better understand how and when tyrannosaurs became giants, paleontologists have sought examples of their lineage from when they were small. Their latest discovery is a tiny tyrannosaur that lived in the shadow of larger predators some 96 million years ago.

Because the book, a New Orleans picaresque, became a Pulitzer Prize-winning classic, the play ""Mr. Toole"" -- a fictionalized recollection of the novelist written by Vivian Neuwirth, a student of his in the 1960s -- elicits a glimmer of curiosity based on its concept alone.

Casting the Off Broadway stalwart Ryan Spahn in the title role, opposite Linda Purl as Thelma, amps the allure. Yet, as admirably as they acquit themselves in Cat Parker's Articulate Theater Company production at 59E59 Theaters, there is the dispiriting sense of watching talented actors trapped in a show that they cannot save.

Ostensibly, ""Mr. Toole"" is a memory play. Its narrator, Lisette (Julia Randall), is an undergraduate in a poetry class that Toole teaches in New Orleans. She has a raging crush on him, which might be why, after his memorial service, she goes to his parents' house and tells a devastated Thelma that she wants her paper on ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"" by T.S. Eliot, back. Priorities, right?"

One Robot, a Dozen Engineers and the Race to Revolutionize the Way We Build

By Jonathan Waldman We're told that Scott Peters has all the iconic Start-Up Guy traits. He's as obsessive an engineer as Elon Musk, as aggressive a salesman as Travis Kalanick and as exacting a visionary as -- cue beam of golden light -- Steve Jobs. What sets Peters apart is that you've never heard of him, perhaps because of the size of his dream. It's approximately 8 inches by 3.5 inches by 2.3 inches. Peters, you see, wants to disrupt bricks. More precisely, he'd like to perfect and sell an automated bricklaying robot, but even this is misleadingly grand. His creation, SAM, for ""semi-automated mason,"" requires several human masons to feed it bricks at one end and clean its large diaper pail of mortar excretions at the other. The original idea for SAM belongs to Peters's architect father-in-law, and so does the majority stake in their upstate New York company, Construction Robotics. What Peters owns are the nightmares from a decade invested in a machine that has no clear market and looks less like the future than a souped-up hot dog cart. ""Forget about it,"" a construction veteran says after watching SAM belch, squeak and stall under pressure. ""It's not going to work."" When grand vision meets repeated humiliation we usually get tragedy or comedy. But ""SAM"" is not sad, or funny ha-ha. It is peculiar, though. In a prologue, Jonathan Waldman reveals that his father wrote a dictionary of robotics and that he had a youthful passion for the subject. With cinematic hauteur, Waldman then pans ""400 miles north,"" to a boy growing up at roughly the same time who was also fascinated by robots. ""This boy, though, was the descendant of some very inventive and courageous and stubborn men, and he had bricks in his blood."" The shared passion, the heroic ancestry, a portentously unnamed boy, and that killer cliche to the skull, are not just misplaced flourishes. They're the beginning of some major tonal weirdness. Waldman seems determined to write an epic entrepreneurship tale -- and it blinds him to the reality of poor SAM, while rendering Scott Peters nearly mute.

""SAM"" covers 10 years in two parts. The first is largely set in a rundown facility just south of Rochester, N.Y., where a handful of ex-G.M. and Kodak engineers make halting progress on a prototype. The key metric is bricks per day, and initially the Construction Robotics team struggles to coax SAM to lay 108. Even the laziest human mason can do six times that. SAM's robot arm is a diva, but mortar is the bigger concern. The viscosity of ""mud,"" as the trade calls it, changes all the time, and masons must rely on their instinct and experience to sling it effectively. SAM has neither. Infusing a robot with nuance is a challenge worthy of the engineers' skills, but Waldman can't resist invoking higher stakes. ""A lot hung in the balance -- not just for Scott but for America. Brickworks, having endured decades of decline, was disappearing. Who cared about bricks? Nobody. And everybody.""

It's at this point that readers who count themselves in the ""nobody"" category should pause. Because Waldman isn't satisfied just enlarging SAM's importance. He wants to change how we feel about bricks. There's a scenic tour through brick history (""Bad brickwork, of course, is relative. In ancient Babylon...""), with stops along the way for century-old trade disputes (""If it was made of gypsum, it was for plasterers. If it was made of cement, it was for bricklayers"") and some brick-based attempts at seduction that go about as well as you'd expect. ""Plop a New Yorker in Kathmandu and the Nepalese bricks cast a spell over the foreigner, suggesting he's not so far from the Big Apple. Clay resonates."" Thlunk. The relevant facts in these digressions point to a brick apocalypse that dates back as far as 1895. Only 4 cents of every construction dollar still goes to masonry, and the 150,000 remaining masons (average age 55) aren't eager to semi-automate themselves into obsolescence. These problems haunt Scott Peters when he takes his machine to market in ""SAM""'s second half. Demand is limited, even as a rental, and the masons who don't try to sabotage their future robot overlord are at best uninterested in assisting much with its operating needs. It doesn't help that SAM is kind of terrible. Inspired by Eric Ries's popular book ""The Lean Startup,"" which advises software engineers to release a minimum viable product followed by rapid cycles of iteration, Peters thrusts SAM -- an unmistakable hunk of hardware -- into the harrowing chaos of live construction sites knowing it's likely to disappoint. Even Waldman calls this decision ""somewhere between ridiculous and insane."" What follows is numbing, if not surprising. SAM is plopped onto site after site and breaks down thanks to a combination of buggy software, spotty Wi-Fi, robot arm arthritis, rickety scaffolding and bad weather. Peters begs the client for mercy. Repeat. The engineers gradually zap SAM's bugs and boost its bricks-per-day output well past the 1,000 mark, but the monotony of chapters devoted to each gig (Laramie: ""From the start, the job had bad juju"") exposes the book's most inexplicable flaw -- the chasm between what Waldman reveals and what he withholds. He's long on engineering detail and indiscriminate heaps of Scott Peters's bio. A two-page section has sentences that begin ""In fifth grade,"" ""In sixth grade,"" ""In seventh grade,"" ""In ninth grade,"" and, for variation, ""In 10th and 11th grade. ..."" Three pages are devoted to one of Peters's swim coaches.

What's missing is Peters's voice. He's quoted once -- for nine words -- in Waldman's chapter-length dive into Peters's formative years. Occasionally Peters offers something bland like ""We gotta fix this,"" but we almost never hear him discussing important strategic choices or his feelings about the miserable process of innovation. When the prose heads in a direction where a quote feels inescapable, Waldman often resorts to formulations such as ""He wanted to say..."" or ""though Scott didn't put it in these words..."" before zipping off on a lengthy authorial paraphrase. The scarcity of the protagonist's voice is so bizarre that it becomes a distraction. Did author and subject have an arrangement restricting quotes? Was Waldman not present for many of the events he recounts? Is Scott Peters ... a robot? If Peters's absence is mystifying, the lack of key financial facts in a book about entrepreneurship is unforgivable. Only in an epilogue do we learn that SAM retails for $500,000, that Construction Robotics would need six sales a year to break even, and that six-figure checks from Peters's father-in-law are all that's keeping the company solvent. Then, as a throwaway, it's revealed that none of this matters. SAM has been supplanted by MULE, a ""material unit life enhancer,"" and within months of its arrival Construction Robotics has moved an impressive 75 MULEs at $73,000 a pop. And what does a ""material unit life enhancer"" do? It lays blocks."
29711,Kendrick Lamar Gives 'Black Panther' a Weighty Soundtrack,"The album attached to the superhero film juggles multiple missions, and is nearly as densely packed and ambitious as one of the rapper's own solo LPs.","Kendrick Lamar packed &ldquo;Black Panther the Album&rdquo; with nearly as many ideas, allusions and ambitions as one of his solo records.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/15/arts/15ALBUM-BLACKPANTHER1/15ALBUM-BLACKPANTHER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b0a786474a552c7c8b908d75b4190ba9f917cf6d735ef16289ff4f8b9f59a7e7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-black-panther-soundtrack-review.html,eea0b2d5-1356-5076-8211-b0c24cd3ca76.jpg,"Kendrick Lamar packed ""Black Panther the Album"" with nearly as many ideas, allusions and ambitions as one of his solo records.



All the symbolic weight attached to ""Black Panther"" -- as a major Hollywood blockbuster with an African superhero, an African-American director, a majority-black cast and a vision of a highly advanced, self-sufficient, colonialism-free African kingdom -- extends to ""Black Panther the Album,"" a collection of songs ""from and inspired by"" the film. That's a loose enough rubric to give the album's executive producers, Kendrick Lamar and the CEO of his label, Anthony Tiffith, known as Top Dawg, the leeway to build a coherent album that juggles multiple missions. After four studio albums and many other releases, Mr. Lamar is this moment's pre-eminent rapper: furiously inventive, thoughtful, virtuosic, self-conscious, musically adventurous and driven. ""Black Panther the Album"" is very nearly as densely packed -- with ideas, allusions and ambitions -- as one of Mr. Lamar's official solo albums. He's superbly abetted by his frequent collaborator Sounwave (Mark Spears), the producer or co-producer on almost every track, who shifts the atmosphere constantly -- often within a single song -- deploying ratchety trap percussion, menacing electronics, blurry pitch-shifted samples, and even a rock guitar. ""Black Panther"" does include the mandatory action-film pop anthems. In ""All the Stars,"" Mr. Lamar raps about conflict between hopeful choruses from SZA. But the song's release as a single has been marred by complaints that its video clip imitates, without credit, the imagery of a Liberian-British artist, Lina Iris Viktor.

Ending the album is the more grimly determined ""Pray for Me,"" with the Weeknd mournfully vowing to ""spill this blood for you"" and Mr. Lamar rapping about how ""I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself"" over a track that vaguely suggests African drumming and traditional ululations. Ballads, another soundtrack-album requirement, are equally burdened. The English songwriter Jorja Smith sings ""I Am"" over an adamantly sluggish drumbeat and a lonely guitar line, affirming a sense of duty: ""When you know what you got, sacrifice ain't that hard,"" she declares.

The album's broader strategy is to hint at the movie's story while concentrating on tales of struggle and swagger much closer to home. From the songs, it would be easy to believe the movie was set in California, although there are bits of African input tucked in. Mr. Lamar dips into the roles of both T'Challa, the African king of the fictitious Wakanda who is also the Black Panther, and Erik Killmonger, his tenacious adversary. Yet in the track ""Black Panther,"" which ends with the words, ""I am T'Challa,"" Mr. Lamar is also quite insistently ""King Kendrick"": ""King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken,"" he raps over a nagging, dissonant loop. Later in the track, with an almost conspiratorial voice, he asks, ""What do you stand for? Are you an activist?"" Mr. Lamar announces ""All hail King Killmonger"" in ""King's Dead,"" after a litany of repudiation and denial -- ""Not your baby, not your equal/Not the title y'all want me under"" -- that may sum up Killmonger's negativity. But it also parallels Mr. Lamar's refusal on his albums to accept oversimplified roles like spokesman or generational conscience.

The album's many guests don't try as hard to connect with the movie. Most of them appear as California figures, flaunting fancy cars and thinking about street-level battles. ""Paramedic!"" is a showcase for the Sacramento group SOB X RBE, boasting about being ""heavy in the streets"" over plinking percussion. Ab-Soul and Anderson .Paak share ""Bloody Waters,"" matter-of-factly describing growing up around, and perpetuating, endless lethal gang rivalries: ""It's warfare. Is war fair? No.,"" Ab-Soul raps. The album welcomes some South African rappers and singers, and there are brief glimpses of South African rhythms; its most cheerfully upbeat song, ""Redemption,"" features the South African singer Babes Wodumo riding the South African club beat called gqom. Mr. Lamar and Vince Staples share ""Opps"" with Yugen Blakrok, a South African rapper as quick and convoluted in her boasts as they are: ""Crushing any system that belittles us/Antidote to every poison they administer/Switch it like time signatures,"" she raps. The track, produced by Sounwave with the composer of the film's orchestral score, Ludwig Goransson, uses a low, scowling synthesizer line, West African talking drums and a thumping beat suggesting South African house music. Another South African, Sjava, sings fervently in Zulu in ""Seasons,"" a slow soul vamp that makes way for raps from two Californians, Mozzy and Reason, about being trapped in a cycle of institutional racism, poverty and violence. Those aren't problems that a song or a superhero can solve. But if ""Black Panther"" had wanted simple comic-book escapism, it wouldn't have hired Mr. Lamar."

It had also lost the moments of fan-generated, supercharged intensity that come with a packed stadium. Now, with Djokovic disqualified, the U.S. Open has almost fully transformed into a tournament carried by the sport's next generation, with few of the mainstays who have propped up tennis for more than a decade, other than Serena Williams. ""It's a chance to create new stars,"" said Jim Courier, the former world No. 1. ""We need those new stars to be winning majors also for the general American public to really pay attention to them, but you have got to start somewhere.""

On the men's side, with Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal not here to hog the attention and trophies, the future is being scripted by a new generation of bigger and freakishly athletic players in their early 20s. And the women's game, already so wide open, appears as though it will only open up further in the coming years, even as Williams pursues a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title before retirement. Djokovic was mostly overpowering in his first three matches, but it was Felix Auger-Aliassime, 20, of Canada, his country a quickly rising power in tennis, barely breaking a sweat as he dispatched the British star Andy Murray, who was making a comeback from hip surgery, on the court where Murray became a Grand Slam champion in 2012. The men's draw, packed with Europeans, started with the most players younger than 23 at a Grand Slam tournament since 2005, according to the ATP Tour. Ten men under 25 years old made the round of 16, the most at a Grand Slam since the 2009 Australian Open, and the most at the U.S. Open since 2001. ""This feels like a beginning of sort of the next phase,"" Courier said. The transition will not be easy. Tennis has enjoyed a golden era during the past decade, with Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Williams staking their claims as the greatest pro of all time. It will not likely happen again soon.

As players that only hard-core tennis fans are familiar with duel in empty stadiums -- Sunday afternoon featured round of 16 matches between Petra Martic of Croatia and Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan and Alejandro Fokino of Spain and Alexander Zverev of Germany -- it is hard not to see the rows of unoccupied seats as an omen. ""Let's hope it is just this one year,"" said Andrea Gaudenzi, the chairman of the Association of Tennis Professionals, which represents the male players and their tournaments. Williams -- a megastar without whom it would have been difficult to see the tournament happening at all -- may yet win the title. The less well-known Sofia Kenin, 21, of the United States, won the Australian Open in January and barreled her way into the second week at the U.S. Open before losing, 6-3, 6-3, to the 16th-seeded Elise Mertens of Belgium. Naomi Osaka, the 2018 U.S. Open champion, has drawn significant attention both with her play and her persistence in speaking out against systemic racism. Even with them at the top, the women's tournament is basically a crapshoot. By Sunday evening the No. 23 and No. 28 seeded players in the women's draw had booked spots in the quarterfinals, as did Shelby Rogers, ranked No. 93 in the world. ""The women's game is so deep, anybody can win a major,"" Jen Brady, 25, of the United States, declared Sunday after upsetting a former world No. 1, Angelique Kerber, to make her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. For years tennis relied on rivalries to sell itself. Judging from this year's U.S. Open, that might not be possible in the near future, for the men and especially for the women.

""There is nothing in sport like a great rivalry,"" said Steve Simon, chief executive of the Women's Tennis Association. ""But going into every big event, whether it's the U.S. Open or Roland Garros or Wimbledon or Australia or the tour finals, we have all of these possibilities and 10-12 story lines versus one or two."" Gaudenzi, the chairman of the men's tour who once ranked as high as No. 18 when he played, said tennis has been through transition periods before, most recently when Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi retired in the early 2000s. ""We are talking about the three greatest players of all time, and they are going to be hard to replace and highly missed,"" he said, referring to the Big Three of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic. But, he added, ""we've got good players and good personalities"" beyond them.

Those players who will be on display this week also bear little physical resemblance even to the Big Three, suggesting that tennis's future looks taller and even more physical. For years, most top tennis players came in all sizes. Then came Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray, who are all roughly the height of small N.B.A. point guards. Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Zverev, the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 seeds at the U.S. Open, are all 24 or younger, and have the combination of height and footwork of N.B.A. wings like Kawhi Leonard, the Los Angeles Clippers star. At 6-foot-4, Auger-Aliassime evokes the style of Golden State Warriors shooter Stephen Curry with a tennis racket. Their long arms function like trebuchets, producing cannon-like serves and powerful forehands. ""You still need one of these players to break through,"" said Donald Dell, the longtime agent and co-founder of the ATP. ""But money is the big motivation"" that could attract even more of the world's top athletes to tennis, he said. That is especially true in women's tennis, which is by far the highest paying sport for women and one which offers equal pay at the biggest events. It also helps explain the depth of American women in the U.S. Open field, even as European women dominated the top 20 seeds. The United States has more depth than it has had in decades, especially in its pipeline."

What to See on Broadway



How a Gang of Droogs Get Fit (Ultrafit) Off Broadway

Nine droogs (and one alternate droog) gathered an hour and a half before showtime at New World Stages on a recent Friday night. To a chorus of syncopated grunts, oohs and aahs, they began to warm up. Most actors preparing to go onstage exercise their voices, do some stretching or Zen out with peace and quiet. The unusual high-intensity warm-up for ""A Clockwork Orange,"" however, could rev up Floyd Mayweather for his next pay-per-view.

Now Alex, who unmercifully pummels his way through young adulthood for sport before eventually finding that his angry impulses have been conditioned out of him, and his fellow denizens of the Korova Milkbar have arrived Off Broadway. The most taxing part of being in the all-male cast may be the training. But the results? Sculpted physiques straight out of Men's Health magazine.

Ms. Spencer-Jones said that the training is not just a matter of showing off a fit cast. ""Physique is second to me, really,"" she said. ""Alex makes a point in the book of saying as a young man, you should be the best version of yourself that you can be. And certainly Jonno's translation of that is: 'Don't let your body go to waste when it's in its prime.'"" The play's vividly physical displays of sexuality and violence (shirts? what shirts?) are complemented by a contemporary soundtrack that includes David Bowie, Muse and, in a nod to the novel, modern-day versions of lovely Ludwig Van (Beethoven). It's not a musical, but there are complicated, intense, erotically charged choreographed fight scenes that require the cast to be in top shape to get through the show night after night.

""When I saw this, I said, 'I know how topless I'm going to be,'"" Mr. Davies said. ""And I don't want to be onstage thinking about my body and not looking good because that's half of my energy being taken away from the story."" Now, thanks to the training regime, Mr. Davies and the other cast members look like they belong in a professional wrestling ring. Matt Doyle, one of the new additions to the cast and a veteran of Broadway shows like ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and ""War Horse,"" recently became certified as a physical trainer, as a way to supplement his income between acting gigs.

""When the audition came around and we had a workout as part of it,"" he said, ""I thought, 'This is actually a really wonderful way to tie together all of my passions.' I've never done a piece that could really be strictly called physical theater. And I've never done so much movement onstage."" Ms. Spencer-Jones said she was committed to mounting the play in a way that was faithful to Burgess's writing, rather than the 1971 film version by Stanley Kubrick, a classic in its own right. She is now in talks to develop an all-female version in London -- another opportunity for her to pay tribute to a book she fell in love with as a teenager. ""It's 90 minutes of worship to him really,"" Ms. Spencer-Jones said of Mr. Burgess. Will Carr, deputy director of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation, said that the visceral production would have excited the novelist, who died in 1993. ""It doesn't pull any punches and the physicality is a big point of it,"" Mr. Carr said. ""Its treatment of sexual violence is as powerful as the film. And the fact that it is all male gives you a new perspective on that."""
60263,"For the Jobless, Little U.S. Help on Foreclosure","Programs already plagued by delays and poor participation were not designed to fully address unemployment, now the primary cause of foreclosures.","Mary Ernest of Blackstone, Mass., lost her job as a school aide and was ""reduced to begging, more or less,"" to keep her home.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/05/us/SUB-HOUSING/SUB-HOUSING-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=345&w=600&s=0af8d08b28338d8a273141ff8ea2e72fe30cb2de866400cafdc24a0f07ebdbe7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/business/economy/05housing.html,a45cb3bf-94db-580d-90ff-b7b83c3049c0.jpg,"For the Jobless, Little U.S. Help on Foreclosure

The Obama administration's main program to keep distressed homeowners from falling into foreclosure has been aimed at those who took out subprime loans or other risky mortgages during the heady days of the housing boom. But these days, the primary cause of foreclosures is unemployment. As a result, there is a mismatch between the homeowner program's design and the country's economic realities -- and a new round of finger-pointing about how best to fix it. The administration's housing effort does include programs to help unemployed homeowners, but they have been plagued by delays, dubious benefits and abysmal participation. For example, a Treasury Department effort started in early 2010 allows the jobless to postpone mortgage payments for three months, but the average length of unemployment is now nine months. As of March 31, there were only 7,397 participants. ""So far, I think the public record will show that programs to help unemployed homeowners have not been very successful,"" said Jeffrey C. Fuhrer, an executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

Data released last week suggests that the administration's task is only growing more difficult as the problems created by unemployment and housing persist. New job growth in May was anemic, and unemployment inched up to 9.1 percent, the Labor Department reported Friday. Earlier in the week, a widely watched index found that housing prices had dropped to their lowest level in nearly a decade. And while the rate of homes falling into foreclosure has slowed, the reason is delays in processing foreclosures, not a housing recovery, according to RealtyTrac, a company that tracks foreclosures. There were 219,258 foreclosure filings in April, the latest month available. Critics of the Obama administration's approach to preventing foreclosures have pressed for two years to get officials to focus more of their attention on unemployed homeowners, with meager results. As part of the bank bailout, the Treasury Department was given $46 billion to spend on keeping homeowners in their houses; to date, the agency has spent about $1.85 billion. Morris A. Davis, a former Federal Reserve economist, estimates that as many as a million homeowners slipped into foreclosure because of insufficient help for the unemployed. ""The money was there and they didn't spend it,"" said Mr. Davis, an associate real estate professor at the University of Wisconsin. ""I don't mean to sound outraged, but I am pretty outraged.""

Administration officials said their programs have had a positive impact, albeit not as large as they had hoped. But they say that the problems of unemployment and negative equity on homes are not easily solved. They also say programs to curb foreclosure are voluntary, so they are limited in how far they can push mortgage servicers and investors, who often make more from foreclosures than from offering aid. ""We are trying to be careful in designing programs that at the end of the day aren't just about spending money but getting people back on their feet,"" said James Parrott, a senior advisor at the White House's National Economic Council. President Obama has been scrambling to curb the number of foreclosures ever since he arrived at the White House. At the start of 2009, the administration announced its primary foreclosure prevention initiative, the Home Affordable Modification Program. It provides incentives to banks to modify mortgages, reducing monthly payments for eligible homeowners. The administration said the program would help three million to four million homeowners, but so far, only 670,000 homeowners have received permanent modifications. In addition, the program was primarily meant for homeowners with risky mortgages; jobless owners are often ineligible because some payment, albeit reduced, is required. Administration officials said the program was helping homeowners whose income had been reduced. Sixty-one percent of homeowners who received permanent modifications listed ""curtailment of income"" as their reason for applying, though it is not known how many of them are unemployed or simply had their hours or pay reduced. The Department of Housing and Urban Development received $1 billion as part of the financial regulatory reforms that passed last year to help unemployed homeowners. That money will be used to provide government loans to unemployed homeowners for up to 24 months.

Though the program was announced last fall, so far applications are being accepted in only five states; the others are delayed because of ""implementation challenges,"" a H.U.D. spokeswoman said. Critics do acknowledge one bright spot -- the Hardest Hit Fund, a federal program that will provide $7.6 billion so that some states can administer their own programs for struggling homeowners. Of that, 70 percent will be directed to unemployed homeowners, said Andrea Risotto, a Treasury spokeswoman. So far, $455 million has been spent. Over the last several years, academics, housing groups and government economists offered proposals to Treasury officials to help the unemployed avoid foreclosure. One, which Mr. Fuhrer of the Boston Fed helped write, called on the government to provide loans, or grants, to unemployed or underemployed homeowners to make up for the amount of income they lost. The loan would have to be repaid once the homeowner found a new job. Another proposal, by a non-profit group called the PICO National Network, a coalition of faith-based community organizations, would have allowed unemployed homeowners to postpone much or all of their mortgage payments for a year or more. But administration officials have balked, arguing that regulators and ""other industry stakeholders expressed strong reservations"" about allowing unemployed homeowners to extend payments for longer terms, according to a Dec. 23 letter that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner sent to Rep. Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachussets, who had pressed for measures that would more directly aid the unemployed. The debate is largely playing out on the sidelines of partisan Washington politics, since Republican lawmakers have made clear they would like to get rid of anti-foreclosure programs altogether, and would certainly block any new programs. Instead, it is largely setting Democratic-leaning homeowner advocates against Administration officials over how best to spend money already appropriated."

Many wrote in to sing the praises of her famous (and contentious) red sauce made with just four ingredients -- tomatoes, a stick of butter, an onion and salt -- and others gushed about her roast chicken with lemons, pork braised in milk and minestrone.

Still more answered with one word: Bolognese. One reader called Ms. Hazan's meat sauce from ""The Classic Italian Cookbook,"" her 1973 debut, ""the gold standard.""

It's that ideal cold-weather recipe that we reintroduce to you here. If you're not familiar with Italian recipes for Bolognese, be warned: It is not the traditional Italian-American meat sauce, punctuated by strong notes of tomato, garlic and oregano. Hers is influenced by the flavors of northern Italy (particularly the city of Bologna), so there is no garlic or olive oil, but there is milk and butter and a hint of nutmeg. It might seem like an odd combination, but the milk and butter mellow the intensity of the acidic tomatoes. The wine, nutmeg and vegetables create a complex flavor profile that transforms this sauce into something truly spectacular.

Keep in mind that the finished sauce is very rich, so when serving, dole it out with a light hand. As one NYT Cooking reader wrote: ""The noodles should show under a coating of sauce, like varnish rather than paint."""

14231,There Is No Such Thing as a Bad Player,"There is a universal lesson in Patrick Bamford's story, a reminder that judging players is often not quite so straightforward as decreeing some good enough and others not good enough.",Patrick Bamford: well traveled but now settled at last in Marcelo Bielsa&rsquo;s Leeds.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/08/sports/06rorynewsletter-top-print/06rorynewsletter-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=09c3a7441eaa8dd1431fa85e0c5f877ca7adfc54479edbd85d5537d124a285c4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/sports/soccer/leeds-patrick-bamford-premier-league.html,220c3eaf-086d-50de-b116-26037731578f.jpg,"Patrick Bamford bounced around for a long time, the sodium glow of his youthful promise fading in the shadows of all those blind alleys. A few months at Crystal Palace, when he did not start a game, and a spell at Norwich City, where he failed to convince his manager he was worth keeping. Burnley was a dead end, too. It was not until he arrived at Middlesbrough that he finally managed to make a Premier League start and score a Premier League goal, but it was only one. And the season ended in relegation, anyway. This was not what had been expected of Bamford. It was not, most likely, what he would have expected of himself. He had joined Chelsea at 18, and was rich enough in potential then that one of the biggest clubs in the world had paid a couple of million dollars or so to sign him after only two senior appearances.

Or, at least, that was the assumption. In 2012, when a club signed a teenage prospect, the natural conclusion was that it must have found a sensation, a next big thing waiting to take the game by storm. It would not have occurred to anyone, then, that a club might sign a young player so it could harvest loan fees for a few years and then sell him at a vast profit. Looking back, of course, that is precisely what happened to Bamford at Chelsea. It was not that he wasn't supposed to make it; it was that doing so would have been a bonus. The club was, effectively, running an industrial-scale player trading operation, developing young players so they could be sold on, with the subsequent revenues reinvested into the first team. There is nothing wrong with that -- nothing, at least, in a legal sense; moral reactions may vary -- but it came at a cost to Bamford. He has always been judged by the standards of the player it was assumed he was meant to be. Every loan spell that did not quite work out provided a little more evidence that he had not lived up to his early talent.

Two seasons later, Bamford is a Premier League player. More than that, he is a Premier League-standard player. He scored one of Leeds United's three goals at Anfield on the opening weekend of the season. He scored another in a 4-3 win over Fulham a week later. Then he scored a decisive goal in an impressive victory at Sheffield United. Not long after, he scored all three in a 3-0 win against Aston Villa. He has played seven games and scored six times. Those goals have been of all shapes and sizes: pretty finishes and scruffy ones, artful ones and emphatic ones, from close range and from distance. A player written off as destined for life to be a second-tier workhorse has arrived in what is regarded widely -- and occasionally even accurately -- as the best domestic league in the world and has been transformed into Ruud van Nistelrooy.

The explanation for that is, in part, specific to Bamford. It is only now, as his father, Russell, recently told The Athletic, that he is working for a coach -- Marcelo Bielsa -- who ""believes in him."" It is only now that he is with a club invested in his success. For all the due diligence Chelsea and its peers among the superpowers do when finding client clubs to take their players on loan, the athletes are rarely anything more than borrowed assets. Players on loan are easily discarded. And Bamford, 27, is, perhaps, at an age when he is more centered, more comfortable, more at ease. Bamford, semifamously, had a privileged upbringing. He went to private school. He plays the violin. He speaks three languages ""conversationally,"" which in his case is probably not a resume-boosting euphemism for knowing how to ask where the swimming pool is. In his early years, that made Bamford an outlier in a sport where difference is too often seen as weakness. At times, he has admitted previously, it was a source of discomfort for him. Now he is old enough and wise enough to shrug it off. (He is also, as Phil Hay, a journalist who has covered Leeds for longer than is healthy, has pointed out, working for a manager who will not even be aware of his background, much less care about it.)

Bamford is flourishing under Bielsa partly because of the connection between the two of them, but largely because he fits the coach's system perfectly. Bielsa does not need his striker just to score goals; that is not the sole metric by which he judges the effectiveness of his No. 9. Instead, the forward in Bielsa's vision of soccer is there to hold the ball up, to bring others into play, to create space, to destabilize the defense and, in particular, to lead the press. Goals are helpful, of course -- goals are the point of soccer -- but they are not the only metric. It is the same reason Jurgen Klopp finds it odd that Roberto Firmino attracts criticism for not being more prolific; it is why Rafael Benitez, a generation earlier, built a title-winning team with Mista as its spearhead, a player who scored 48 goals in 218 games across a decade in La Liga. Bielsa sees Bamford in precisely the same light. Too often, as fans and as observers, we write off players when they fail to meet some indistinct performance standard. We determine that they are not good enough for this team or that level. We demand that they are dropped or sold or upgraded. We decide that they will never make it.

England went back into lockdown on Thursday. This one is set to last a month, initially, but longer feels likely. In July, the government -- on suspiciously short notice -- canceled Eid for those living in some of Britain's largest Muslim communities, so there really shouldn't be any reason to place a firewall around Christmas. There are tighter pandemic restrictions in place across Europe now, too: nine cities subject to curfews in France; partial shutdowns in Germany and the Netherlands; limits on opening hours for restaurants and bars in Italy. The continent is in the grip of the second wave of the coronavirus, and most are warning that, without stringent measures, it may rise higher than the first. Elite soccer, you will have noticed, is carrying on regardless, even at a time when youth sports are being put on hold. The domestic leagues continue uninterrupted. The Champions League group stage has reached its halfway point. At a time when borders are closing and travel is being restricted, soccer has an international break planned.

None of this has been met with any moral outcry. No anonymous executives have come forward, as they did in spring, to demand that the season be abandoned, to declare that it is abhorrent to play on while the death tolls mount. There have been no calls to nullify and void everything immediately. Nor should there have been, of course: Elite soccer has proved, over the last seven months, that it can play on in a time of pandemic. The number of positive tests among players remains low; the testing regimen is thorough and assiduous. Most important, the sport has not been linked to any major outbreaks, and it has not placed any excessive burden on health or emergency services. But it does raise two questions. One is why those who wanted to abandon soccer in spring on moral grounds are not calling for the same to happen now. The other is: Given that Europe is facing what may be a long winter of monthslong lockdowns, what would have happened if soccer had not proved that it could play on? What if we had set the precedent of abandoning last season? Without seven months of evidence that soccer, at least among the elite, can function in these conditions, presumably we would have to abandon this season now. That could mean almost an entire year without any revenue at all for clubs and associations. It would mean a return was effectively impossible until a vaccine had not only been found, but also been widely administered. Soccer did not handle that conversation at all well in spring. It was fraught and self-interested and duplicitous and, at times, toxic. But, in hindsight, it may well have been the game's salvation. If it had not started then, it is not clear, now, whether the games really would have been able to start -- in any recognizable form -- at all.

Jesse Marsch looked a little forlorn as he tramped across the field to congratulate his opponents and commiserate with his players on Tuesday night. It was not hard to see why: His Red Bull Salzburg team had been holding Bayern Munich with 12 minutes to play in their Champions League game. By the time Marsch stepped on the turf, head bowed, his team had lost, 6-2. Sympathizing with any of the Red Bull teams -- being, as they are, the sporting emissaries of a corporate empire -- is a complex thing. As we wrote of RB Leipzig in August, they make imperfect underdogs. All they have to compete with the game's elite, after all, is the backing of a $20 billion drinks empire, and some of the best facilities money can buy. Still, it is hard not to feel as if Salzburg has given more to the Champions League than it has, thus far, received. Marsch's team went toe-to-toe with Bayern Munich, the best side in Europe by some distance, for 80 minutes this week, and got nothing. It lost only at the last against Atletico Madrid the week before. There is an element of deja vu here: Last year, in its first Champions League group stage appearance, Salzburg lost narrowly to Napoli at home, took a point in Naples, and almost drew with Liverpool at Anfield. Only fine margins and an unkind draw separated Marsch and his team from a place in the last 16. The same fate, most likely, awaits Salzburg this season. That is a shame, because this is a team that would hardly wilt in that rarefied company: a collection of emerging stars -- with special mention for Dominik Szoboszlai -- and a coach who encourages them to play adventurous, intense soccer. Marsch was, clearly, disappointed his team could not quite get over the line this week. He can take great pride, though, in how far they have come. Thanks to Joe Klonowski, who saw in last week's retelling of the Colombian Pirate League an echo of baseball's Federal League. ""The reserve clause was the maximum wage, holding wages down,"" he wrote. ""Joe Tinker, Edd Roush and Mordecai 'Three Finger' Brown"" were baseball's de Freitas, Rial and Di Stefano, famous players who jumped to the outlaw league for better pay.

Christopher Orr, meanwhile, is not convinced that someone's having to become West Brom is quite the problem for a super league that I have suggested. ""I'm wondering if we're missing the fact that most fans of English football would prefer to watch West Brom in the Premier League than Brentford, Luton or Bristol City in the Championship. In a super league, isn't it logical to assume fans of European football would also prefer watching the 'West Brom of Europe' to watching domestic league sides in regionalized European versions of the Championship?"" That's all for this week. There's plenty to keep your eye on across Europe this weekend: Bayern visits Borussia Dortmund on Saturday in the Bundesliga, and Sunday is packed -- Lazio against Juventus, Atalanta against Inter Milan, Liverpool visiting Manchester City, and then Valencia hosting Real Madrid. This week's Set Piece Menu is a good one, on what role sport plays in broader culture. And, of course, please tell your family and friends that there is more to The Times than just working out which way Pennsylvania went."
31024,Hip-Hop With an Irish Lilt,The first rap acts in Ireland emerged in the early 1990s. But it has taken until now for the music and the culture to start flourishing.,The rapper Rejjie Snow performing at the Olympia Theater in Dublin this month.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/24/arts/25irishhiphop1/25irishhiphop1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d4fd9496e4de0737722575a69790f1eafcf0e962992d7f0998989d6e1143ab54&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/arts/music/ireland-hip-hop-rap.html,8fc8186c-4166-5fc0-95bb-0602668b9f49.jpg,"DUBLIN -- The Irish are renowned for their way with words. But the nation of bardic poetry, James Joyce and W. B. Yeats has proved a latecomer to the wordiest of music genres, hip-hop. ""It's always been corny to rap and be from Dublin,"" Rejjie Snow said in an interview in his dressing-room in the Olympia Theater, a plush 19th-century concert hall in the Irish capital. ""I don't know why. Maybe it's the accent, maybe it's the lifestyle. When I told people I wanted to rap as a kid, they were like, 'Oh you want to rap?'"" But Rejjie Snow's eccentric choice of career has been vindicated. A few hours later, one of the rising stars of Irish hip-hop, 24, stood in the spotlight on the Olympia's stage, microphone in hand, faced by a young, excited crowd chanting ""Rejjie, Rejjie"" and rapping verses from his newly released debut album, ""Dear Annie,"" back at him. At one point, a teenager at the front hauled herself onto the barrier separating audience from stage to shout, ""Rejjie, I love you!"" The first rap acts in Ireland emerged in the early 1990s. But it has taken until now for hip-hop culture to start flourishing, with rappers and groups proliferating across the country. The situation resembles Irish rock in the 1970s, when bands sprung up in a grass-roots modernization of Irish music.

Two forces lie behind Irish rap's rise. One is a new generation of immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean, attracted to Ireland during its ""Celtic Tiger"" boom years in the 1990s and 2000s. Their numbers are tiny by the standards of other European countries -- in the 2016 census, just under 65,000 people identified as black in a nation of almost 4.7 million -- but talent in the emerging music scene is disproportionately drawn from among them. Rejjie Snow, whose given name is Alexander Anyaegbunam, has a Nigerian father and an Irish-Jamaican mother. The other factor is the growth in popularity of hip-hop itself. Since 2010, it has eclipsed other genres to become the global lingua franca of youth culture. In 2016, Drake was the most streamed act in the world on Spotify. He was also the most streamed in Ireland, which has the youngest population in the European Union. This year's lineup for one of the country's main music events, the Longitude Festival, has risked rock fans' ire by turning to hip-hop artists.

Casey Walsh, 20, and his childhood friend Alex Sheehan, 21, make up the duo Versatile, a north Dublin take on the strain of delinquent rap acts running back from Eminem to the Beastie Boys. They made a surprise appearance at Rejjie Snow's Olympia Theatre gig, to a fervid response from the audience. ""Ireland never really took to the hip-hop music, it was just a select few,"" Mr. Walsh said in a Skype interview. ""But now, festival lineups are just hip-hop acts. It's crazy.""

""I used to cringe when I heard Irish rap,"" he added. ""Stuff about how the government's robbing us and our lives are so bad."" ""And no one wants to hear it,"" Mr. Walsh said. A do-it-yourself ethos predominates among Irish hip-hop acts. Audiences are built using social media and YouTube videos: Versatile get as many as a million views for theirs. But like the Irish rock bands in the 1970s, rappers in search of a record deal are forced to look to Britain or the United States. Rejjie Snow, who lives in Brooklyn, is signed to the influential New York label 300 Entertainment. His latest album was mainly recorded in London and Paris.

""Compared to two years ago it's so much better,"" Celaviedmai, a 25-year-old rapper from Galway whose given name is Maimouna Salif, said in a telephone interview. ""It's seen as a real career, it's not seen as a hobby or a pastime."" Celaviedmai is one of a handful of female rappers in Ireland, in what is still a male-dominated scene. ""Ireland is so small that it's so difficult to do things on your own,"" she said. ""There aren't enough resources, or they're too expensive.""

The positive side-effect of limited resources is artistic ingenuity. Irish rap abounds in different styles. Rejjie Snow's songs are dreamy and off-center. Socially conscious rap is common; its criminal-minded flip side, street rap, does exist, but to a lesser degree. Grime, a vibrant Britain-based offshoot of rap, is beginning to make its presence felt. Other acts fuse hip-hop with Afrobeats, R&B and dance music. The free-for-all mirrors wider rap trends. The last decade has seen a breakdown of the importance of region to hip-hop, its reliance on place as a marker of a particular sound. The internet has collapsed distances between scenes. But Irish rap's lack of definition also points to a fluidity within Irish identity.

""Thought I had to be American, thought I had to be English, everything else but Irish,"" the Rusangano Family, a trio from Limerick, rap on one of their tracks. In an interview, Godknows Jonas, 27, a member of the group, said, ""That's a very personal line, because identity is something that has always been a confusing one as someone who got here from Zimbabwe."" ""When I was younger, I'd feel like I didn't fit in with my friends, and then I'd go home and feel I didn't fit in with my parents: They were still holding onto the culture from back home,"" he added. ""For me, writing those lines was like me staking a claim of who I am. I'm proud to be Irish, I'm proud to be African, I'm proud to be who I am."" What it means to be Irish in 2018 is up for grabs. ""Our identity as Irish people is socially and culturally evolving,"" said Mango, whose given name is Karl Mangan, a 27-year-old rapper who makes grime music with the producer Adam Fogarty, 35, who is known as Mathman.

The process is not without tensions. In rap, they center on the question of accent. American or mid-Atlantic accents are not uncommon among Irish rappers. Rejjie Snow, who left Dublin at 17 to live in Florida, is an example, though he described his own rapping voice as ""neutral."" Mr. Fogarty has his own views about how an Irish M.C. should sound. He said there was ""a quite significant part of our hip-hop history where artists were using fake accents. Slowly but surely, there has been a shift away from that."" Lilo Blues, 21, a member of the Dublin rap trio the Hare Squead, groaned when the issue was raised. He grew up in southern Dublin listening to American hip-hop and R&B. ""I didn't have anything in Ireland to grasp onto in terms of urban culture or sound,"" he said. ""It's not even conscious. It's not like, 'I'll put this phrase in so they can tell I'm from Ireland.' No, it's natural."" At Rejjie Snow's gig at the Olympia, issues of accent and music industry infrastructure faded into the background. Here was Irish rap's acceleration in its distilled form, a propulsive release of energy. Thinking about the destination could wait for another day. ""Yo Dublin, are you ready for Rejjie Snow?"" the D.J. shouted. The answering roar drowned out the beats."
48447,Nonnegotiable: A Jersey City Address,A residency requirement for employment as a firefighter made a couple's decision about where to live a no-brainer.,THE RENTERS Katie Guenther and Craig Vagell in the kitchen of their new apartment.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/17/realestate/17HUNT-MAIN/17HUNT-MAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=6f657cb159d268533f3f02d7db2fbf7be9ddeb2772bd34c9774c80d4d88d77c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/realestate/nonnegotiable-a-jersey-city-address.html,a8698041-f451-521f-b694-57fc041a3f1c.jpg,"There was no question where Craig Vagell would live. As an applicant for a firefighting job in Jersey City, he had a residency requirement to fulfill. Mr. Vagell had been a volunteer firefighter in his hometown of Cedar Knolls, N.J., since his high school graduation. When he met Katie Guenther nearly two years ago, he was renting a studio in the Hamilton Park section of Jersey City for $1,275 a month. His apartment, in a brownstone, had both a washer-dryer and a dishwasher, unusual for that type of building. Mr. Vagell, now 33, commuted to Manhattan for his job in broadcast operations at a television network while he waited for his name to reach the top of the firefighters' list.

""She had her eye on me,"" Ms. Guenther said. ""She talked about Craig to me and I was, like, 'No way.' "" Dating a colleague's son ""would be a disaster."" She changed her mind, and the two are now planning to marry in summer 2017. Around the time they met, Ms. Guenther, who is from Lawrenceville, N.J., rented a one-bedroom in a large apartment complex in Randolph, N.J., paying around $1,390 a month. Late last summer, the couple went on the hunt in Jersey City for a one-bedroom to share. ""I had never really gone over to Jersey City except for maybe some auto shop to get my car fixed,"" Ms. Guenther said. But as she spent more time there, she concluded that ""this is better than Hoboken,"" where she had lived for a time before she moved to Randolph, with more diversity and ""a more mature scene.""

The couple loved Jersey City's handsome brownstone neighborhoods. One-bedroom rents there were on the low end of their price range of $2,200 to $2,800 a month. They browsed brownstones briefly, looking for ""for rent"" signs, but were always led to an agent who charged a fee. They felt broker fees were high and unnecessary. Furthermore, ""it was really hard to find a brownstone with a washer-dryer,"" which was essential, Mr. Vagell said. Few had much closet space, either. They preferred one of the city's new rental buildings, which typically have a convenient gym -- something Mr. Vagell wanted, ""to make sure all the firehouse food wasn't going straight to my belly.""

At Avalon Cove on Washington Boulevard, built in 1999 on the waterfront, the monthly rent for one-bedrooms was in the mid-$2,000s. The couple liked the outside, but inside ""it was blah and there was carpeting that looked old,"" Ms. Guenther said. Mr. Vagell noted the apartments had little overhead lighting. ""You had to bring in lamps,"" he said. ""You are tying up a lot more of your outlets, leaving fewer for other electronic items needing plugs."" As a firefighter, he is always careful to make sure ""you are not overloading power strips and are managing the electrical load as safely as possible."" They crossed the street to see Marbella, built in 2004. At that point, no one-bedrooms were available. They visited a staged two-bedroom, but the monthly rents for one, starting in the low $3,000s, were well over budget.

Its connected sister tower, M2, was rising. Mr. Vagell was concerned about construction noise. (It is now about to open.) As for the pool, it would serve both towers. ""I wasn't sure if, amenity-wise, that was going to accommodate two high-rise towers without being overcrowded,"" Mr. Vagell said. ""Katie wanted a pool, but I was indifferent, really."" On Morgan Street in the Powerhouse Arts District, a new Toll Brothers rental tower, the Morgan, was under construction. There, the couple saw assorted floor plans and renderings. Wearing hard hats, they toured some unfinished units. ""We walked into an apartment that didn't even have a refrigerator installed, and it was dusty, but even so, we loved it,"" Ms. Guenther said. It included a walk-in closet and a stacked washer-dryer. The lighting was fine.

They don't much mind that their view is mostly of a parking lot. ""We would have had a view of the Statue of Liberty, but they built something there,"" Ms. Guenther said. They have invited friends to join them in the grilling area. The building's common spaces close at 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and at 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, which seems early to them. ""If you have company over and you want to hang out, I don't see why the pub can't stay open till 12 or 1 a.m.,"" Mr. Vagell said. The gym, however, is open 24 hours. In the hallway they can hear talking and television from other apartments, but ""the minute you go into your apartment, the noise goes away,"" Mr. Vagell said. A guitar, however, is audible on weekend mornings, but they can live with it. Despite the location near a boulevard, ""when the windows are shut, you're not hearing too much street noise,"" he said. ""We hear the fire trucks."""
37892,Finding That 'Historic Feel' in Jackson Heights,"Tired of pouring money into rent, they traded the charmless modernity of a Brooklyn high-rise for the allure of a prewar co-op in Queens.","Barrett Brown-Fried, left, and Stephen Brown-Fried in their new Jackson Heights apartment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/02/realestate/02hunt4-promo/02hunt4-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c20ff10aff3c9bd2667babb41a7a249205df6995fb118081560740e3542b786e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/realestate/finding-that-historic-feel-in-jackson-heights.html,c12150ba-4d61-5006-ac5d-3d5ac3d625ab.jpg,"Barrett and Stephen Brown-Fried have done plenty of moving. The couple, who married five years ago, started out in a charming Brooklyn Heights one-bedroom, then lived briefly in a renovated loft building in Jersey City. When they returned to Brooklyn, all the apartments they loved had inadequate kitchens, so they rented a place with a well-equipped kitchen in a Downtown Brooklyn high rise, for around $3,200 a month. ""Stephen likes to cook and I like to be the benefactor of his cooking,"" Barrett said. Planning to stay in New York for the foreseeable future, and reluctant to keep pouring money into rent, they decided to buy a home. Barrett, 33, who studied architecture before becoming an executive in beauty and fashion retail, took the lead.

They were hoping for a one-bedroom in a prewar co-op -- with a good kitchen, room for a dining table and wall space for bookshelves -- in a charming neighborhood with convenient subway access. They planned to pay no more than $600,000 and, ideally, closer to $500,000. Many of their friends lived in Brooklyn, and they were reluctant to leave. But ""unfortunately, our money didn't go very far in Brooklyn unless we kept moving farther out,"" Barrett said. Their interest was also piqued by the historic district in Jackson Heights, Queens, where some friends had recently relocated. Unnerved by the thought of moving again, Stephen, 38, a theater director, told Barrett, ""You compile the short list, and I will look at the places that pass your threshold and see what I need to see.""

Last winter, Barrett visited a sunny, spacious one-bedroom in Jackson Heights, with a view of an interior courtyard. The asking price was just under $450,000, with monthly maintenance in the low $800s. ""It was a lovely apartment, but it felt a little more contemporary,"" Barrett said. ""If we moved into the Jackson Heights Historic District, we would like to have that historic feel."" That place later sold for $450,000. The couple contacted Asli Ak, a distant relative by marriage and a licensed saleswoman at 718 Realty in Jamaica, Queens. She thought they would love a newly renovated one-bedroom listed by her brokerage that was also in the Jackson Heights Historic District, a sprawling community of six-story co-op buildings with landscaped courtyards dating to the early 20th century. ""Inside, it was done very elegantly,"" Barrett said. ""They preserved all of the prewar details."" The apartment, listed for $460,000, with maintenance of around $600 a month, included an eat-in kitchen and a dining area. A one-bedroom in a Jackson Heights co-op was well priced, but its contemporary aesthetic wasn't what they were after. Katherine Marks for The New York Times Another offer had already been accepted, but there wasn't yet a fully executed contract, so the agent was continuing to show the unit, Ms. Ak said. ""Don't sleep on this,"" she told the couple, ""because the last thing I want is this to be the apartment that got away."" The Brown-Frieds offered slightly more than the asking price, $475,000, but then rescinded their offer, feeling rushed and uncertain about leaving Brooklyn.

""I freaked out, and we decided we did not want to make this momentous decision from that place of nervousness and anxiety,"" Stephen said. ""I realized I needed to be more present in the search if I was ultimately going to be more comfortable with the decision."" To see Brooklyn listings, they contacted Jodie Garay, a licensed associate broker at Brown Harris Stevens, who had helped a colleague of Barrett's. She showed them a large, sunny one-bedroom on Cortelyou Road in Kensington, listed for $530,000, with maintenance in the low $800s. ""It didn't have a ton of original detail, but it had a prewar feel,"" Ms. Garay said. The couple liked the apartment, but their bid of $550,000 was declined. (The unit later sold for $560,000.) ""While prices were softening in other parts of the neighborhood, they were becoming competitive for a lot of co-ops in Kensington,"" Ms. Garay said. ""It is not always possible to gauge, in a highest-and-best bidding competition, where a property is going to trade."" The Brown-Frieds may have been surprised, but they weren't terribly disappointed. ""I have friends who were looking to buy recently, and they talk about how they were so devastated,"" Barrett said. ""I think we felt relieved, in a way."" A co-op in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn was large and sunny, with ""a prewar feel"" -- and a heftier price than they hoped to pay. Katherine Marks for The New York Times The next day, Ms. Ak contacted them with news. The board of the Jackson Heights co-op, where they had rescinded their offer, had rejected the buyer with the accepted offer, a musician. The unit was available again.

""He had a piano and a violin, and I believe he had some form of guitar,"" Ms. Ak said. ""He was asking the board many questions about when he could play. His perspective was that you buy an apartment and you should be able to make as much noise as you want."" By now, the couple had enough experience to know a good deal when they saw one. They bought the apartment for $489,000. ""Given that we had offered more than that for the apartment in Kensington and were still outbid, we had perspective by this point,"" Barrett said. They arrived in the summer, glad to trade a business district for a real neighborhood. ""In 10 years, I don't think I ever once had a conversation with my neighbors,"" Stephen said. ""Within the first three days of our living here, I found myself having long conversations with my neighbors in the building."" On Sundays, they now shop at the Jackson Heights Greenmarket, although they are unable to make full use of their new kitchen or dining table: They have no gas for the stove because of ongoing utility work outside. Their new building, in the Jackson Heights Historic District, has a neighborly vibe they appreciate. Katherine Marks for The New York Times ""The farmers' market is a good thing but also torturous, because we want to have huge meals,"" Barrett said. Instead, as they wait to use the room that was most important to them, they make do with a slow cooker and a hot plate, and they're experimenting with one-pot recipes. Or, Stephen said, they eat out: ""There's a gazillion great restaurants in this neighborhood."" For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

1306,Review: Camp and Compassion in 'The Confession of Lily Dare',Charles Busch's mash-up of mother-love weepies finds both pathos and hilarity in the tough talk of Hollywood divas.,"Charles Busch, left, as the title character and Nancy Anderson as a plucky prostitute in &ldquo;The Confession of Lily Dare.&rdquo;",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/30/arts/29lilydare1/29lilydare1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0341046d6d4f5ba78c09ef918ef348586cf03ca5f99e91a161fee53ea1fd626f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/theater/confession-of-lily-dare-review-charles-busch.html,d73808e0-8d77-5633-a6b2-863e714fcc12.jpg,"For all their freedoms and frank carnality, the movies of Hollywood's pre-Code era -- roughly 1929 to 1934 -- were often about sacrifice. A woman's sacrifice, to be sure: her honor in exchange for a man's, her happiness for her child's. As the Great Depression took grip, such stories taught America to reframe deprivation as duty, just as Hollywood, entering the sound age, was teaching itself how to speak. One result of the coincidence was the emergence of a new kind of actress, emoting vividly in a stagy accent acquired somewhere between Bryn Mawr and Broadway. Those clipped tones and eccentric pronunciations eventually became part of the drag vocabulary -- and they certainly are part of the joy of ""The Confession of Lily Dare,"" Charles Busch's delicious mash-up of pre-Code weepies that opened on Wednesday at the Cherry Lane Theater. Only when spoken in the manner of a woman fudging her origins could words like ""feminine"" (fem-i-neen) and ""avalanche"" (ah-vuh-lonzh) become such pungent punch lines. Yet Busch, himself a feminine avalanche -- and a reluctant ""drag legend"" -- doesn't really impersonate Ruth Chatterton, Miriam Hopkins, Helen Hayes and the other stars who played harlots, murderesses and mothers forced to give up their children in movies like ""Madame X"" (1929), ""Sarah and Son"" (1930), ""The Sin of Madelon Claudet"" (1931) and ""Frisco Jenny"" (1932). Nor when Busch adds bits of Mae West, Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford into the mix does he bind himself to the style of any one of them.

Instead, playing Lily at various ages and in various predicaments, he offers something of a group portrait of these divas, always hovering at the midpoint between spoof and homage. Beyond the externals that echo each woman in particular roles -- the accents, the gestures, the hairstyles and gowns -- there is an insider's bemused love of them all.

So, too, with genre. ""The Confession of Lily Dare"" is not based on any one mother-love film but rather, it seems, on a hundred. The turn-of-the-20th-century plot naturally begins with an orphan, Lily, whose mother is killed in an ah-vuh-lonzh. After showing up at the San Francisco home of her only remaining relative -- Rosalie Mackintosh, a tough-as-nails madam (Jennifer Van Dyck) -- she befriends the help: Mickey, a gay piano player (Kendal Sparks); Emmy Lou, a plucky prostitute (Nancy Anderson); and Louis, an upstanding bookkeeper (Christopher Borg). Louis is not upstanding for long; after getting Lily pregnant, he promptly dies in the 1906 earthquake. To support her fatherless baby girl, Lily appeals to Blackie Lambert (Howard McGillin), who describes himself with a twinkle as ""a shady character from a once prominent family who adds a veneer of class to whatever room he's in."" He remakes Lily as Mandalay, a cabaret sensation whose big number is a spot-on Dietrich pastiche (by Tom Judson) called ""Pirate Joe."" But before long Mandalay winds up in jail, taking the rap for Blackie over the theft of some diamond earrings. I hardly need explain how the baby, Louise, is adopted by a pair of wealthy San Franciscans, and how Lily, now going by Treasure Jones, reinvents herself post-prison as a madam like her aunt, but kinder. (She scrapbooks.) Suffice it to say that when Louise (Van Dyck again) grows up to be an opera star, Lily refuses to ruin the girl's career by revealing her besmirched maternity, even unto death.

You could call this camp heaven, and indeed ""Lily Dare,"" a Primary Stages production, offers both the euphoria and the shabbiness that term can suggest. As in earlier works like ""Vampire Lesbians of Sodom,"" which ran for five years Off Broadway, Busch doesn't fuss over logic or continuity. Here, he simply lets Mickey and Emmy Lou, visiting Lily's grave decades later, escort the story from scene to scene with bald narration. The visual transitions are likewise written the way they would be in a movie, begging for quick dissolves that can't be achieved and leaving us to twiddle our thumbs while the stage crew resets the furniture. But these clunks are essential to the Busch style, and not just because his plays, with the exception of his Broadway hit ""The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,"" have usually been niche-taste, shoestring affairs. A slight lack of professional polish is part of their aesthetic, one Busch shares with longtime collaborators including the director Carl Andress, who blithely suggests the earthquake with little more than a few falling books; the set designer B.T. Whitehill, who has fashioned a proscenium out of pink plastic Frisbees; and Jessica Jahn, whose hilarious outfits for Lily have more than a hint of the thrift shop about them. (The apt costumes for everyone else are by Rebecca Townsend.) In the same way, the multiple roles that some cast members play (though Anderson and McGillin are perfect in just one role each) function as both thrift and humor. Borg, for instance, is not just Louis the accountant but a pervy German baron, an Italian vocal coach and an Irish priest with a taste for opera. Having to distinguish them from one another pushes each to riotous extremes. Where Busch never stints is in the diamond precision of the overripe patois, studded with boneyards, gin blossoms, the clap and the ""agony box."" (That's a piano.) As Treasure Jones, Lily refuses to let her doughboy clients get drunk: ""We owe it to their mothers to protect their livers."" And awaiting her final fate she imagines the shame she might have brought on her daughter had the truth been revealed. ""My mother a bordello madam. My mother a murderess. My mother ... a cabaret performer."" That's the Busch touch: mordant and winking (he has often been a cabaret performer himself) yet oddly, genuinely moving. If he is unafraid of the cliches of disowned genres, and inhabits so lovingly the women who uttered them, perhaps that's because they actually had more to say than the dismissive term ""weepies"" (or, for that matter, ""camp"") implies. Turns out that sacrifice is something we really did need to learn. Who's weeping now?"

The coronavirus pandemic has exposed crucial shortcomings in our public health system. Plenty of experts said a pandemic was coming, but we ended up with a belated response that included a lack of coordination, inadequate funding and a failure to be strategic. There is no simple solution either to the immediate crisis or to the underlying concerns. But one way to improve the odds that we get the public health system we need, as opposed to the one we have, would be to add a secretary of public health systems to the president's cabinet. True, we already have a designated national public health unit within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration are also part of H.H.S., as is the assistant secretary for preparedness and response. And don't forget the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Department of Homeland Security. Or the National Security Council, which created in 2016 a playbook (now discarded) for a strategic federal response to a pandemic. In theory, these entities taken together should have put in place the measures needed to ensure an effective early warning system, an adequate strategic stockpile, needed hospital surge capacity and an intergovernmental compact with state and local agencies on who would do what.

So what explains our lack of readiness? Sure, there are always unexpected situations that complicate effective performance. No one would have predicted that the C.D.C. would contaminate coronavirus test kits. Or that we would have a president who would show such reluctance to heed the advice of public health scientists. But organizational structure and formal accountability really do shape outcomes. And the current federal model follows the longstanding treatment of public health as a subsection of the traditional medical care system. The C.D.C., for example, with its $8 billion budget, is housed in a government entity that is focused above all on the $1.2 trillion insurance programs (Medicare and Medicaid) it administers. More generally, public health gets less than 3 percent of the $3.7 trillion in national health spending.

How did we get here? Ironically, the story begins with public health victories. Before the 1940s, medical care was rudimentary and largely lacked scientific expertise. Local and state governments, then charged with the task of protecting the health of their communities, focused attention on nonmedical determinants of health, using regulatory authority to ensure working sewage systems, safer food, chlorinated water, cleaner streets, better workplace conditions, improved housing and emergency preparedness. These interventions produced steep increases in life expectancy. Following World War II, however, the federal role in health care grew enormously, arriving precisely when there were extraordinary advances in medical research and care. Federal policy came to be grounded in the assumption that clinical medicine can conquer all disease. This means more dollars for hospitals and for health insurance programs that offer access to the latest medical technologies and fewer dollars for public health and the nonmedical factors that affect health.

The bias against public health is also sustained by the complicated effort to demonstrate an immediate return on investment for the public health dollar, the reality that public health measures often require restrictions on individual liberty and the fact that public health is politically invisible until a crisis strikes. We actually do have more than 3,000 local and state health departments, still the core of our public health system. These agencies prevent threats to health (providing immunizations and screenings), promote healthy living (eat better, stop smoking, be physically active), develop policies to protect community members (inspection of food services), diagnose and investigate health problems and help with emergency preparedness and disaster response. But these agencies are inadequately funded and understaffed. Incredibly, by 2018, there were 56,000 fewer public health workers than there were a decade before. So when the coronavirus arrived, most local health departments were ill equipped to conduct needed diagnostic tests, to isolate the infected, to determine who had contact with the infected and to provide support to vulnerable populations. So this moment when public health and preparedness are highly visible is the perfect time for a steady national focus on how to create a public health system for the 21st century. Without a strong national voice, it is not likely to happen. The current pandemic also illustrates the interdependence of public health and acute care, as demonstrated by the heroic workers now saving lives in hospital emergency rooms and I.C.U.s. But with an effective system of public health preparedness, we would have had less need for such a surge in acute care interventions. Moreover, a cabinet agency is not an antidote for poor leadership. It's unlikely that President Trump would pay more attention to a public health secretary than he has to Alex Azar, the secretary of H.H.S. Nor is a cabinet agency a substitute for the local and state health departments that should remain the core of our public health system. But just as the Sept. 11 attacks changed America (and the world), so too will Covid-19. We need thousands of additional public health workers, more and better public health labs, increased investment in data analytics and early warning systems, and more effective control over the supply and distribution of needed protective equipment. Our state and local health departments also need a dedicated federal partner that can supply them with data, listen to their concerns, channel funds effectively and create clearer lines of communication back and forth."
33339,Addicted to Love,Meet The Times's new romance fiction columnist,Jaime Green,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/books/31Green-Image/31Green-Image-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=198&w=380&s=861ea51b6278f05a8ed58aa71e3c81b23d4952281f21e0044eada6e004c05eb6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/books/review/jaime-green-romance-columnist.html,d9476b64-385d-5835-bf61-d3c2dc078338.jpg," makes her debut in The Book Review this week. Below, she discusses some of her favorite books, and why she thinks romance matters.

You're The Times's romance fiction columnist. What on earth qualifies you?

This is like having to write a cover letter for a job I already have! I started writing about romance novels not to review them, but to explore how they fit into the world -- culturally and politically. I've been thinking about not only how good, fun and smart these books can be (very, very and very), but also why they matter, what motivates romance authors and what readers find in their work.

Let's be real, what qualifies anyone to be a book critic?

Here's what I'm trying to do. First, to look for books that are worth talking about -- because they're great, because they're interesting or because they're important. But criticism is neither pure evaluation nor pure dissection. Second, to come to books with an open mind -- I like to think about how a book achieves its own goals, and what those goals are, rather than how it meets my own expectations.

The Gray Lady ... covering romance novels? Why now?

Romance is one of the biggest genres in publishing. That's unfortunately been part of why, I think, it's so often written off. The Times covering romance is an important recognition that these books are a vital part of literary culture. Some readers stick to romance, but plenty of romance readers -- including myself -- read it among many other genres. And we read The New York Times, too."

Quenette if she thinks that colleges and universities are doing a good job refereeing the debate over free speech, and she'll respond with an emphatic 'no.' ""Schools are not doing enough to protect free speech,"" Ms. Quenette, a communications professor at the University of Kansas, said in an email. ""Specifically, they are protecting the speech of some, those whom they fear or those voices which are loudest, but they are not protecting the speech of those whose voices are easier to silence. Generally, these quieter voices are those of faculty and staff who should rightfully fear for their jobs should they use unpopular, but legally protected, words."" If anyone has a personal stake in the issue, it is Ms. Quenette, 34, who took a paid leave of absence after students criticized her for uttering a racially insensitive word during class. The word was spoken during a discussion on race and recent protests on campus. Offended students wrote a letter calling for her resignation for use of the word and for seeming to suggest that some minority students who were dropping out were simply academically unfit rather than the victims of discrimination. The letter called her words ""terroristic and threatening to the cultivation of a safe learning environment.""

Although the university cleared Ms. Quenette of violating its nondiscrimination policies, it denied her bid for tenure and said it would not employ her after next May. Joseph Monaco, a university spokesman, said in a statement that the decision was a ""personnel"" matter unrelated to the racial issues, but he did not elaborate. Ms. Quenette and her husband, Scott, a software engineer, have joined a chorus of voices calling for stronger support for free expression on campuses -- even as students themselves are often seeking some curbs on speech they deem offensive. According to a poll recently released by the Gallup Organization, 78 percent of 3,072 students from 32 four-year private and public colleges believed their campuses should strive to create an open environment where they would be exposed to a range of speech and views. Twenty-two percent noted that ""colleges should prohibit biased or offensive speech in the furtherance of a positive learning environment."" But 69 percent favored limitations on speech when it came to language that was deliberately upsetting to some groups.

An October 2015 survey of 800 students nationwide, sponsored by the William F. Buckley, Jr. Program at Yale, reported that 63 percent favored requiring professors to use ""trigger warnings"" to alert students to subject matter that might be unsettling. By a 51 percent to 36 percent margin, students also supported speech codes to regulate speech for students and faculty. The controversy has brought disruption to many campuses. In February, a student at Gettysburg College, a small liberal arts institution in Pennsylvania, hung posters featuring a photo of a baby and the sentence, ""Abortion is the number one killer of black lives in the United States."" It ended with the hashtag, Black Lives Matter. Some students demonstrated, saying that the posters singled out African-American women in an effort to promote an anti-abortion campaign. They also said the posters made misleading use of the ""Black Lives Matter"" slogan. In April, the school revised its Freedom of Expression policy, re-emphasizing the school's commitment to free speech -- even when the speech may be offensive.

In late May, students at DePaul University in Chicago stormed the stage while the conservative blogger Milo Yiannopoulos -- who had been invited on campus -- was speaking. The fracases have left colleges struggling to figure out how to help students and faculty members balance respectful discussions about race and diversity with open conversations on difficult topics. They are asking: How can campuses best navigate inclusiveness and debate while being mindful of students who feel marginalized, disrespected and overlooked? ""These are complicated issues, balancing a commitment to academic freedom with these demands for censorship and the greater awareness of the negative impacts on people of hearing speech that makes them uncomfortable for whatever reason,"" said Geoffrey R. Stone, a professor of law at the University of Chicago, noting that the First Amendment applied only to students and faculty members at public institutions, not private ones. At private institutions, he said, the issue is one of academic freedom as a matter of policy.

In November, the University of Kansas held a meeting on race that drew more than 1,000 people. But during the event, a group of students took over the stage, saying that the forum was organized in an effort to silence voices rather than to listen to them. ""There is a fine line, and I don't necessarily know where that fine line is,"" said Harrison Baker, 21, a senior and a member of the Student Senate who attended the event. In May, the City University of New York created both a Task Force on Campus Climate and a Working Group on Freedom of Expression. More recently, Columbia University in New York announced the creation with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation of the $60 million Knight First Amendment Institute at the university to promote free expression.

""Schools need to have statements that clearly express the importance of free speech on campus,"" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California, Irvine. ""Universities have to be about open inquiry and ideas. But campuses need to say, 'We're a community and we want everyone to be comfortable.'"" In the early 1990s, more than 350 schools adopted hate speech codes, he said. But about a half dozen were struck down as unconstitutional, and most schools had not written new statements addressing these questions. In late 2014, Professor Stone and other faculty members created the University of Chicago's Statement on Freedom of Expression, which was released January 2015. ""The University's fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrongheaded,"" they wrote, in part. ""It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose."" Thirteen schools including Princeton, Columbia and Purdue have adopted some versions of the Chicago Statement, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. At Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., a version of the statement was adopted by the faculty in February but was later vetoed by the board of trustees, which said it had legal concerns over the ""uninhibited but still respectful exchange of ideas."" ""Right now, the faculty has academic freedom, but there is nothing that comprehensively guarantees students free expression,"" said Matthew Hoffman, an associate professor of history at Franklin & Marshall who initiated the motion to get the Chicago Statement into the faculty handbook.

One school that received praise in certain circles was Emory University in Atlanta. A few months ago, some students were enraged by the appearance of sidewalk ""chalkings"" of ""Trump 2016,"" which many considered racist and intended to intimidate. About 40 students protested outside the administration building, and later met with the president, James W. Wagner. In a campuswide email, Mr. Wagner wrote, in part: ""As an academic community, we must value and encourage the expression of ideas, vigorous debate, speech, dissent, and protest. At the same time, our commitment to respect, civility, and inclusion calls us to provide a safe environment that inspires and supports courageous inquiry. It is important that we recognize, listen to, and honor the concerns of these students, as well as faculty and staff who may feel similarly."" As for Ms. Quenette, who was unclear about her next career move, if the situation arose again, she said she would ""absolutely"" use different language. She said she had used the racially charged word solely as an example of how words could be used to discriminate or to victimize others. ""Although I never intended to hurt anyone or offend anyone,"" she said, ""I am sad that this was the outcome of my words."""
1367,Amazon Powers Ahead With Robust Profit,The internet giant posted increases in revenue and profit after shoppers flocked to it during the holiday season.,"An Amazon warehouse in Eastvale, Calif. The company's earnings report on Thursday exceeded the expectations of analysts.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/30/business/30amazon/30amazon-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=1350abd4ac70a48f51b107c085e6470baf136960b4936238b9764ca5b66781d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/technology/amazon-earningts.html,821e2285-1bd4-535d-b0c3-c878d5273051.jpg,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Amazon sold a lot of things to a lot of people in the last three months of 2019, as speedy shipping shortened the time between ""I want it"" and ""It's here."" That was expected. What no one anticipated was that profits would also shoot up. On Thursday, Amazon said it had earned $6.47 a share in the quarter, up from $6.04 a year earlier. Analysts had forecast $4.04 a share, and some would not have been surprised if it had been less. Amazon went wide last year with one-day shipping for members of its Prime service, and ""fast"" is usually synonymous with ""expensive."" Not this time. Amazon said more customers joined Prime in the fourth quarter than ever before, pushing worldwide membership to 150 million households. That total was also more than analysts expected. It was 100 million less than two years ago. Sales came in at $87.4 billion, up 21 percent from a year earlier and above what Wall Street predicted.

""What we saw was essentially very strong holiday performance, from the middle of November on,"" Brian Olsavsky, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call on Thursday. The more Amazon sells, the more efficiencies of scale it can find. So, he promised, Amazon will get bigger. ""We will have to scale our fulfillment center network further,"" Mr. Olsavsky said. Amazon has about 500 shipping facilities in the United States and 600 elsewhere in the world, according to MWPVL International. If the last decade was all about Amazon's ascendancy in retail, the next several years will bring more of a pitched battle. ""This will be the decade of the algorithmic retailer,"" said Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy at the consulting firm Publicis Sapient. ""Companies like Walmart and Target will use all the data they have acquired to compete more effectively with Amazon."" AWS, the high-margin cloud computing division that has been a big source of Amazon's profits in recent years, also increased its revenue in the quarter, by 34 percent to $9.95 billion. Amazon has a wide lead in renting computer space to other companies, although Microsoft, which reported this week that its cloud revenues had risen 62 percent in the quarter, is striving to catch up. The fourth quarter of 2019 was the first big test of Amazon's one-day shipping, which began last spring.

In early 2019, sales at the Amazon store were drifting down, growing at a modest rate (for Amazon) of about 12 percent annually. Always fearful of settling into complacency, the company announced that it was making one-day shipping standard for Prime households. Two-day shipping had been the rule since Prime's introduction in 2005. The Seattle company said it would spend an initial $800 million to carry out the program. It was classic Amazon: trading profit for revenue. As usual, the revenue flowed in. But the expenses continued. Additional costs related to one-day shipping were initially expected to be about $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter but came in a little less, Mr. Olsavsky said. Amazon also continued its hiring spree during the quarter, signing up 48,000 new employees for a total of 798,000. One of the factors that inspired people to join the company during the last decade was the soaring value of the stock, which is an important part of compensation for managers and engineers. With investors uncertain about profits, shares in regular trading Thursday were about 8 percent lower than the all-time high reached in September 2018. If that stall continued, Amazon would have had to increase compensation or suffer a brain drain. For the moment, at least, that worry has abated."
40747,Fran Lebowitz: By the Book,"The humorist and social commentator says her ideal literary dinner party is one that nobody is invited to: ""My idea of a great literary dinner party is Fran, eating alone, reading a book.""",Fran Lebowitz,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/books/review/0326-BKS-ByTheBook/0326-BKS-ByTheBook-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2017&h=551&w=1050&s=414d1f3759b442a559b5cca72a8fe0981c806603c38777984741199466951f57&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/books/review/fran-lebowitz-by-the-book.html,5bdaabdd-ad81-5f48-a871-823e2ea04f89.jpg," What books are on your night stand now? There are no books on my night stand, because I'm a lifelong insomniac, so eight or nine years ago, I thought: ""Don't read in bed. It's too stimulating. Watch TV instead. It's boring."" And it's true. TV is boring, but apparently not boring enough to make me fall asleep. So now instead of being overstimulated and awake, I'm bored and awake. What has your postelection reading looked like? My postelection reading has looked pretty much like tea leaves, with just exactly the success you might imagine. I've definitely noticed since the election that even though generally I have a lifelong preference for reading fiction, I have less interest in it now. Except for rereading, which I've been doing a lot. Especially John O'Hara. I suppose this is my way of comforting myself. What's the last great book you read? This really kind of stumped me. Unlike almost everyone else I can think of, when I say great, I mean great. Not just great this year or not just extremely good. I know you're not supposed to have this kind of old-fashioned hierarchy of books. But I do. So I'm trying to think of the last really great book I read. And all I can come up with is something I reread, which was ""Memoirs of Hadrian,"" by Marguerite Yourcenar, which is actually great, and by great, I mean forever.

What's the best classic novel you recently read for the first time? ""Little Dorrit."" I never was a Dickens fanatic. Except for ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" which I loved. But I was looking for something to read and I asked Deborah Eisenberg and she said, ""Have you ever read 'Little Dorrit'?"" Which I had not, and I was so startled -- since she rarely recommends a book that wasn't written by a dead Hungarian -- that I immediately read it, and I loved it. What's your favorite book no one else has heard of? This is a question that I really find odd. How do I know what no one else has heard of? I can name books that I think are fairly obscure. I could say Henry Green. But now, as of last summer, everyone is reading Henry Green. There is a writer named Wyndham Lewis, whom you're supposed to hate, but I don't. He wrote a book called, ""The Apes of God,"" which is a book I particularly like and am interested in. I suppose other people like it and have heard of it, but I assume it is obscure enough for this answer. Which writers -- novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets -- working today do you admire most? This is something I usually avoid answering, because you always leave someone out. But I wrote up a list. Toni Morrison, Deborah Eisenberg, Lynne Tillman, Wallace Shawn, Junot Diaz, Ben Katchor and Cynthia Ozick. Who is shockingly smart. Whose opinion on books do you most trust? Pretty much all the time. Especially if I'm supposed to be doing something else. I was very frequently punished for reading as a child because I was reading when I was supposed to be doing homework. I got in trouble in school for reading, I got in trouble at home for reading. My mother would actually bang on my door and say, ""I know you're reading in there!"" In my adult life, I've gotten in trouble for reading because I'm not writing when I'm reading. So it's really rare that reading is unaccompanied by guilt for me. But I've learned to live with it. I feel guilty pretty much all the time.

The only time I read without feeling guilty is on a plane, because what else could I possibly be doing? What moves you most in a work of literature? I think it might be the word ""move"" that kind of perplexes me, because that's a word connected with emotion. I don't really seek out emotion when reading. The feeling that's most important to me when reading is that I'm absorbed. I just want to be taken away. I really like being dazzled. That would be nice. The thing I care least about in reading is the story. I just don't care that much about stories. That may have to do with being older. Tell me a story I don't know. But really, I read in order not to be in life. Reading is better than life. Without reading, you're stuck with life. Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? In my lifetime, I've read one zillion mysteries. This is not because I care about who did it. I don't care. And I almost never figure it out. I don't have that kind of mind at all. I don't care who did it. I have reread mysteries numerous times and I don't even remember who did it. I've read all the Agatha Christies. I've read all the Nero Wolfe books by Rex Stout. He wrote many of them, but not enough for Fran. I'm always hoping to find one I've never read. It's the same as the New Yorker's dream of finding an extra room in your apartment that you didn't know was there. One thing I like about mysteries is that they end. Which is true of so little else. I have avoided science fiction my entire life, or any kind of fantasy. When the Harry Potter books came out, I bought the first one because everyone said how great it was. But I didn't like it. And I realized I would not have liked it as a child either. I'm not saying I don't love her, because she did a great thing. To see children lined up outside bookstores -- that was fantastic. But those kinds of books. . . . It's like adventures or people who climb mountains or jump out of airplanes; I find real life challenging enough. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Obviously, paper. I mean, actually, on his show once, Jimmy Fallon gave me a Kindle. He actually gave it to me as a present. I said: ""I know you gave me this because I don't have one. You know what else I don't have? A Bentley."" I don't think they're horrible. I don't object to them. I'm just not interested in them. People are always showing me this stuff like I'm from outer space and I've never heard of it. I have really bad eyesight, so they always tell me you can make the type bigger. I suppose that would be a good thing for me, but I don't care. I'd rather squint.

I see people using them on the subway. It seems to me that the majority of people you see reading on these things are in their 40s. I see fewer kids reading on them, and by kids I mean people in their 20s. These are the people I see most frequently reading actual books, which I find very encouraging. How do you organize your books? My books are organized first by category. Fiction, letters, essays. Those kinds of categories. And then there are many subdivisions. Then within categories, they're alphabetized. I always have arguments with the guy who helps me organize my books, because I have a biography section. He says: ""You can't have a biography section. You have to have them arranged by writer. For instance, Henry James's fiction, then the letters, the biographies, etc."" And I say: ""I know. That's the right way to do it. But that would take up too much space."" All the apartments I buy or rent are for my books, not for myself. I don't need the space. I'm 5-foot-4. I have a whole bookcase that this guy calls ""your crazy books."" The crazy book category. Those books are not alphabetized. I also have a large reference library. I have numerous encyclopedias; I have many, many dictionaries. I actually bought myself the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1978. I always wanted it, and when I wrote my first book and had some money, I bought it. I didn't have it growing up; I had the World Book, because it was less expensive. The Encyclopaedia Britannica was so hard to buy, I can't tell you. I had to make one million phone calls. Because it was generally sold on an installment plan. They didn't know how to send these books to someone who is just going to send a check. Nobody uses these books anymore, but I do. When the second edition of the O.E.D. came out, there was nothing I wanted more. It was like $10,000. I had a friend who owned a bookstore, and I begged her to let me buy it at cost, and she did. It was still several thousand dollars, but I'm delighted to own it, even though I think it's now free on the internet. You're in the process of moving your personal library. What's that been like? Believe me, I'm not in the process of it yet. Because it's so awful, I keep putting it off. But I just did it a year and a half ago. They come and pack the books. That takes three days. But two times before that, it took two months to organize them first. I have many bookcases. They have glass doors. They are mostly 19th-century. The books all go in certain places in my apartment. I like to have fiction in the living room, reference books in the writing room. I have 10,000 books. I know this because I move them. When I move, I go through them and take some out. Many books come to this house unbidden. And unbidden books, I don't want to keep them. Once the books are all rearranged, I can put my hand on any book. I know where they all are. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I don't know. Maybe my small library of soap carving books, because most people don't have them. People are surprised at the fairly large number of cookbooks I have, because I don't cook. I hate cooking, and I never cook. But I like to eat, and I like to read about food. The very first book in my library was a book my mother bought me at a house sale in the late 1950s called ""Six Little Cooks."" She bought it for a quarter. I couldn't believe that I was allowed to have such a beautiful thing. This was my first book that I thought of as very valuable. It's a story about a woman who goes to visit her niece and her friends and decides to spend the summer teaching them how to cook. It's signed by the author and all the girls. Maybe because of this book, and maybe because they used to be so cheap (they no longer are), I have quite a few cookbooks. What's the best book you've ever received as a gift? I don't know. I've received some really wonderful books as gifts. I have some first editions of Dawn Powell, whom I love. I would never buy these books. I buy books to read. It adds about 80 zillion dollars to the price of a book to have a signed or first edition. I have some first edition Thurbers. I'm thrilled to have them, believe me. I got a first edition Thurber for my birthday this year, and that was the last book to make me laugh out loud when I reread it. I got kicked out of class in third grade reading Thurber. I couldn't contain myself. I could not stop laughing. But not all funny writers are necessarily funny in that way. Oscar Wilde is probably the wittiest writer in English, but he doesn't make me laugh out loud. There was a writer named Peter De Vries who did make me laugh out loud, so hard that when I was reading one of his books when I was in the hospital as a teenager, the nurse took it away from me because she thought I was going to break my stitches.

Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain? I don't really have these kinds of favorites. I probably had them as a child. I associate having favorite things with being a child. I'm not youthful enough to have these kinds of favorites. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I was a constant reader. Just like I am now. I was constantly reading. I read under the covers with a flashlight. I loved ""The Secret Garden."" The ones every girl my age read. I also have a lot of my mother's books. Mostly I went to the library as a child. ""Heidi,"" Nancy Drew. I would say mostly conventional kinds of books. You're organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? None. I would never do it. My idea of a great literary dinner party is Fran, eating alone, reading a book. That's my idea of a literary dinner party. When I eat alone, I spend a lot of time, before I sit down to my meager meal, choosing what to read. And I'm a lot better choosing a book than preparing a meal. And I never eat anything without reading. Ever. If I'm eating an apple, I have to get a book. Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn't? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? I wouldn't say disappointing or not good, but I will say that I have never enjoyed reading William Faulkner. I am not saying he's not a great writer. I will just say that I prefer not to read him. I don't enjoy reading him. I did not acquire the ability to not finish a book until I was 50 years old, which probably has to do with scarcity as a child: You have a book -- finish it! But I've made a number of decisions since then. If you don't like a book, stop reading it. If you don't like a movie, walk out. Life is not a jail sentence. When I used to be able to go into bookstores all the time, when there were lots of bookstores, I could read a few sentences and put it down. Now I hear about a book and get someone to order it on the internet, and when the book arrives I find I don't like it. I only read for pleasure. I don't have to finish a book. Sometimes, I don't realize how little I care about a book. Sometimes, I start reading a book and then realize I forgot I was reading it. And it disappears under a pile of books. Whom would you want to write your bio? I would say Carolyn Keene. Because then at least I know they would find the culprit.

If I'd known Carolyn Keene was not a person as a child, I would have been crushed. All women my age loved Nancy Drew books. In the '80s, they had this Nancy Drew party to celebrate some new editions, and every single woman writer in New York was there, dying to talk about Nancy Drew. There weren't many books about girls, let's face it. It was pretty uncommon. What do you plan to read next? I don't plan my reading. I really don't. I'm always surprised. I can't believe that people keep these lists of the books they read. People are so organized! This is a cast of mind so different from mine. I do have piles of books that I haven't read yet. When I finish a book, I go through that pile. I recently noticed a book that hadn't been read through two moves. I'll give it to someone. It's a good book. It's just not for Fran. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? It would depend on who's reading it to him."
59402,Cost of Prekindergarten Special Education Is Soaring,"The cost of New York City's special education prekindergarten program has nearly doubled in six years, and governmental oversight of the contractors running it has often been lax.","A prekindergarten class at Bankstreet College of Education, in Manhattan.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/06/nyregion/JP-SPECIALED1/JP-SPECIALED1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=1fa26b27ae98dd6520ebbb6e42f9e9ae70e73146de275376d6c09849241c0d88&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/education/prekindergarten-costs-in-new-york-city-have-doubled-in-6-years.html,c5c6c4ae-f080-5b69-839b-695e0647c971.jpg,"New York City is paying private contractors more than $1 billion this year to operate a little-known special education program for 3- and 4-year-olds, nearly double the amount it paid six years ago. The program serves 25,000 children with physical, learning, developmental and other disabilities. While the number of children in the program has risen slowly in recent years, annual costs have soared to about $40,000 per child, according to an analysis of city education spending by The New York Times. The city pays private contractors to provide classes, as well as individual instruction at homes, day care centers and nursery schools. Children may also be prescribed speech, physical and occupational therapy in half-hour sessions, several times a week. The prekindergarten program is far more expensive in New York than it is elsewhere, and oversight by the city and state has often been lax, according to interviews with officials, regulators and contractors.

Education and budget officials said they were alarmed by the costs, but maintained that lobbyists for private contractors had blocked efforts in Albany to curb spending. The program, often referred to as special-ed pre-K, now accounts for about 6 percent of the city's $19 billion education budget, the spending analysis showed. ""Certainly these children are deserving of services, but it's a question of whether all this money is actually benefiting them or is being wasted on the contractors,"" said Raymond J. Domanico, director of education research for the city's Independent Budget Office. City officials said some of the growth in spending stemmed from more awareness of autism: some special-ed pre-K students, for example, are receiving behavior-modification therapy as many as 35 hours a week, driving their costs as high as $200,000 a year. But the officials acknowledged that autism services accounted for only part of the increase. When government auditors have delved into disclosure reports by contractors, they have routinely discovered irregularities.

Some contractors have billed the program for jewelry, expensive clothing, vacations to Mexico and spa trips to the Canyon Ranch resort, The Times found in a review of a decade's worth of education, financial and court records. Others have hired relatives at inflated salaries or for no-show jobs, or funneled public money into expensive rents paid by their preschools to entities they control personally.

While the pandemic has created an urgent search for teachers in some areas, not every district is suffering from shortages. Here are the factors in play New audits by the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli -- which focused on a dozen special-ed pre-K contractors, seven of them in New York City -- have already led to a felony guilty plea by one Brooklyn contractor, and officials said more arrests were expected. In New York State, overall spending on special education for 3- and 4-year-olds is expected to approach $2 billion in 2012, with the largest increase in recent years occurring in New York City, according to city and state records. In most of the country, public school districts provide special-ed pre-K. New York is the only state that turns over the program to private contractors, many of which are for-profit companies. (The state's program predates a 1986 federal law mandating special-ed pre-K, and New York always relied on contractors.) The contractors often have a dual role: they evaluate children and identify disabilities, and then they deliver services, at costs that are higher than in other states, education experts said. Technically, city administrators choose which contractors provide services, but in practice, contractors acknowledge that they have significant influence over these decisions. Under this structure, contractors have an incentive to inflate the number of services children require, said Julie Berry Cullen, an economist who has studied special-education spending. ""People who evaluate students say it's an objective process,"" she said. ""But it's not. It clearly responds to financial incentives.""

Records obtained by The Times under the state's Freedom of Information Law showed that 83 percent of the contractors that evaluated children in the program since 2003 went on to teach those same pupils. Steve Albert, who oversees special-ed pre-K for the city's Education Department, acknowledged that the program was expensive, but said that it worked. ""The bottom line is, we have an awful lot of kids with disabilities that are increasingly needing more services per student,"" Mr. Albert said. ""And these kids are having better outcomes later on, the more you put in now.""

""Like any and every program, you can always find abuse or outliers,"" he said. ""But investments for infants, toddlers and young children are right and financially smart."" Pamela A. Madeiros, a lobbyist for the New York State Alliance for Children with Special Needs, a large group of prekindergarten contractors, testified before the Legislature in March that criticism of conflicts of interest was ""baseless and provocative."" Ms. Madeiros, who did not respond to messages seeking comment, said that to bar evaluators from providing services was akin to preventing a doctor who made a diagnosis from treating the patient. Done right, special-ed pre-K can have a considerable impact, said Mary Ellen Markman, who runs the pre-K program at Bankstreet College of Education in Manhattan. ""The older kids get, the less elasticity there is in the brain,"" she said. And parents who criticize New York's system generally say too little is spent: overworked administrators take too long with paperwork, and children are denied services for which they were approved. ""If there's any way to crack down on agencies doing the wrong thing, do that, so agencies doing the right thing can continue,"" said Randi Levine, a lawyer for Advocates for Children of New York. Still, New York's costs far exceed those elsewhere. Pennsylvania serves nearly 50,000 children for about $5,100 a child, officials said. Massachusetts, whose program is considered ""resource-rich"" by experts in the field, spends less than $10,000 a child.

""I hope they're getting laptops and tablets and a ride to school in a chauffeured limousine,"" said Michael Salvatore, the schools superintendent and a former special-ed pre-K teacher in Long Branch, N.J., which spends $9,700 a child, including busing. As New York's program has become more expensive, the city and state have not increased scrutiny of contractors, officials said. Regulators rely on contractors' own accountants to vouch for billing. City and state officials conduct audits infrequently, and when they do, the results often languish on the shelves of the State Education Department. Some audits have not been given final approval and released until years after the contractors being audited went out of business. Penalties for overbilling are relatively mild. City officials said they were reluctant to close contractors because they did not want to reduce the number of special-ed pre-K seats, given the high demand. Many contractors view weak penalties as the ""cost of doing business,"" said Jerry Barber, an assistant state comptroller who has had a role in special-ed pre-K audits since the 1990s. ""If you're a bad actor, you'll just figure out a new way to game the system again next year,"" he said. ""You'll figure the auditors won't be around again for three or four more years -- if they ever come back."" Valerie Grey, executive deputy commissioner of the State Education Department, said regulators could not significantly control spending without legislative approval. Asked whether the State Board of Regents had pressed for reforms, Ms. Grey said, ""The board has made a consistent, concerted effort to evaluate how the program could change while still assuring that children have the services they need.""

But Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Queens Democrat who is chairwoman of the Education Committee, questioned the department's commitment to reform. ""It requires their advocacy for their proposals and their willingness to look at compromises,"" she said. ""The side that speaks the loudest are the disabled and their parents themselves."" Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, suggested limited changes in his budget proposal this year, but the Legislature has not approved them. Local officials, who run the program based on state regulations, said even minor reforms were stymied. ""From our perspective, it's just kind of stunning,"" said Stephen J. Acquario, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties. ""When I go to try to meet with a senator or assemblyperson, I can't even start the conversation."""

Mr. Chisic, who is in the diamond business and lives in Tel Aviv, had a better idea: call Dylan Pichulik, the chief executive of XL Real Property Management, who manages the apartment for him. As soon as he was hired, Mr. Pichulik asked Mr. Chisic for all of the condominium's paperwork -- manuals, offering plan, bylaws, everything. ""Dylan took the warranty papers, called the company, and was able to replace the dishwasher for no cost,"" Mr. Chisic said. ""I was impressed with that. I could never have done that myself."" With the number of foreign investors on the rise in New York real estate, Mr. Pichulik identified a demand for management services that he says was not being met. Traditional management companies do represent absentee owners but are not always equipped to deal with complicated tax issues, for instance, and might not be available at 2 in the morning when a client calls from another time zone. Mr. Pichulik, who is 30 yet has the resume of a seasoned authority, had found a niche. About four years ago while working for the HFZ Capital Group, a New York development, investment and asset management firm, Mr. Pichulik oversaw a residential development project on which he came to know a lot of the buyers, many of them from outside the United States. Some passed his name to friends who were also excited about buying New York City real estate, and they went to Mr. Pichulik for advice.

""They said: 'I'm buying something, but where do I go from here? And can you help me?' "" Mr. Pichulik recalled. ""They want the upside but not the hassle. There was a demand, and no one else was doing it. And that's when I decided maybe I should."" He began XL Real Property Management in 2012 with 12 clients. Today, XL manages about 1,000 properties, ranging from a studio in Harlem that rents for $1,500 a month to an apartment on Central Park West for $40,000 a month. His employees all have backgrounds in real estate -- from law to interior design. And French, German, Hebrew, Dutch, Italian, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese and Russian are spoken at XL. On a very cold Wednesday last month, Mr. Pichulik breezed into XL's temporary offices on the 17th floor of a Madison Avenue office building. Office furniture was stacked in a corner, sample windows leaned against a chalkboard wall, and workers were sitting at desks set up higgledy-piggledy throughout the warren. As he made his way along a corridor in a gray flannel suit, Mr. Pichulik had about three different conversations without breaking stride. ""I never sit,"" he said, sipping from a can of Coke. ""I don't even have a desk chair."" Mr. Pichulik is constantly on the move -- he is skinny as a rail and goes through a pair of pointy brown Hugo Boss oxfords every three months -- and no two work days are the same.

One day, he might have to Uber up to a new 10-unit building on West 96th Street that the company has recently taken on, to meet Haim Haviv, his facilities manager, who is figuring out how to make the empty closets of a three-bedroom apartment appealing enough to merit a monthly rent of $10,000. ""We manage the building for a foreign investor,"" said Mr. Pichulik, who talks about eight miles a minute with only the slightest trace of an accent from Atlanta, where he grew up. ""I like to add value, reposition assets, make it nice and save money. Here, it's punch-list stuff -- putting in appliances, finishing closets, choosing light fixtures. We can't leave the closets blank. Renters don't want that. What do we need to do to make it work?"" At a building on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Mr. Pichulik recommended that the owner revamp the peculiar layout of a unit that had been renting for $4,500 a month. Mr. Pichulik oversaw the complex job, and now the apartment rents for $6,000. Sometimes he has to clean up messes. When XL took over the management of 13 furnished one-bedroom apartments in a building downtown for Singaporean owners, he found the places had been appointed in Park Avenue boudoir style with furniture of Canal Street quality. ""Who the hell did this?"" Mr. Pichulik said. Turns out, the owners had given the former management company $20,000 per apartment for furnishings; the company appeared to have spent about $3,000 on each unit and pocketed the rest. ""That's the reality of being a remote owner,"" Mr. Pichulik said. ""I had to say to the owners, 'We have to replace the furniture.' "" Mr. Pichulik is driven. He was 15 when his father died of a heart attack, leaving four children and their mother without much wherewithal. He remembers when the electricity was turned off because the bill had not been paid.

""I didn't want that life,"" he said. He enrolled at New York University when he was 16 and graduated at 19 with honors and a degree in finance and marketing. During college, he worked at Citi Habitats. One summer he secured a broker's license, and then started finding apartments for fellow students. After his graduation ceremony at N.Y.U., he hurried down to the Soho Grand Hotel to attend a party that Citi Habitats was giving for its top brokers. He was the top broker. But ""it was not the job for me,"" he said. ""I wanted more intellectual stimulation."" His greatest influence was his grandmother Lena Pichulik, a Polish Holocaust survivor who came to this country with nothing and went on to build a healthy portfolio of commercial real estate in Atlanta, starting with an ice-cream store. From her he learned that you can choose to see things negatively or positively. He has made a career out of finding solutions, whether it's identifying the right climate-control system for the temperamental crotch mahogany doors in a pied-a-terre, protecting the privacy of the famous or personally escorting a sick client back to Israel when her son was not available. (She flew him first class.) ""Dylan is the most reliable and most efficient person I know,"" said Tara King-Brown, a broker at the Corcoran Group with whom he does a lot of business. ""I've had owners' tenants harassing me. Now, when they buy, I say, 'I have a fantastic management company.' That is so valuable."" XL charges a 5 percent fee of gross rent; for rents over $10,000 a month, it will negotiate the rate. And clients receive a detailed report on the 10th of every month. ""I think it's like insurance,"" Mr. Chisic said. Once he had seen XL's reports and ""how efficient this investment can be,"" he bought five more apartments. He handed the keys of his two Upper West Side brownstones over to Mr. Pichulik, too."

The streaming giant, which has more than 158 million subscribers worldwide, didn't make a big deal of it, tucking the data into its quarterly letters to shareholders since January. By Wednesday afternoon, with the release of its third-quarter earnings for 2019, Netflix had gone public with the viewership data for a year's worth of its most-watched original movies and television shows, from last October through last month.

Though the lists don't show how Netflix's original programs rank in comparison with, say, HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" or NBC's ""Sunday Night Football,"" they do provide -- for the first time -- some insight into the popularity of its original shows and films.
* None Netflix's Rebound: The streaming giant said that it The streaming giant said that it added more than 2.4 million subscribers in the third quarter, snapping a streak of customer losses that spurred unease among investors
* None A Cheaper Ad Option: In a bid to attract even more customers, Netflix will soon offer a In a bid to attract even more customers, Netflix will soon offer a $6.99 ad-supported subscription , which will show subscribers four to five minutes of ads per hour of content they watch.

* None Cable Cowboy: The media mogul John Malone The media mogul John Malone opened up about the streaming wars , the fast-changing news business and his own future. At the top of the list for its television series is, no surprise, the supernatural, '80s-besotted series ""Stranger Things,"" with 64 million plays. In second place -- who would have guessed? -- is ""The Umbrella Academy,"" with 45 million views. For Netflix original movies, the most watched are the Sandra Bullock thriller ""Bird Box,"" with an eye-opening 80 million views, and the Adam Sandler comedy ""Murder Mystery,"" with 73 million. The data show s broader trends, too. High school comedies are especially popular on the service, both for television and movies, as are some Spanish-language series. Hollywood has expressed irritation with Netflix's selective disclosures of its viewership numbers from the moment the company started going public with them. Executives at other entertainment companies -- whose shows succeed or fail based largely on ratings measured by the research firm Nielsen -- have groused that the Netflix numbers did not correspond to any traditional statistics, that they were inflated and that they highlighted successes while ignoring the scores of series and movies that failed to attract significant audiences.

But the decision to go public with even some of its data was something of an about-face for Netflix, which once claimed it never wanted to get involved in the weekly Hollywood competition based on ratings or box office receipts. For a movie, according to the statistics that have appeared in the earnings reports, a view denotes that 70 percent of it was watched within four weeks of its premiere. For a television series, the company counts a view as a streaming of 70 percent of one episode within four weeks of the day it appeared on the service. The Netflix numbers do not correspond to any traditional metric used by the entertainment industry. For instance, Netflix reported in January that 40 million households had watched ""You,"" a drama from the prolific producer Greg Berlanti. By the Nielsen measure, a typical episode of ""You"" would have an audience of eight million viewers in the United States, according to the cable network FX, which has access to the Nielsen data. ""An average audience of eight million viewers is good, but it's not an average audience of 40 million total viewers, which would make 'You' the No. 1 show on American television,"" John Landgraf, the head of FX, said when he revealed the Nielsen number. Netflix would not confirm that the data in its earnings reports had amounted to official most-watched lists for its movies and shows. ""We select a few titles to highlight each quarter, but they are not meant to be a comprehensive list of top performers,"" a Netflix spokesman said. In a call with investors on Wednesday, Netflix's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, suggested that the company could start making information about its most popular shows more widely available, potentially going beyond the ""Popular on Netflix"" and ""Now Trending"" sections of the welcome screen for subscribers in the United States. The reason? Viewers like knowing what's popular. ""If they want to use that as a tool to help guide their decision making, we want to help them do it,"" he said on the earnings call."

About a billion miles, give or take, or the distance from earth to Saturn, where the spaceship of the title is thrown off course, greatly increasing the time its load of unlucky tourists will have to spend on their interplanetary cruise.

Set 40 years in the future aboard a vessel that looks like a cross between the Starship Enterprise and a high-end mall, Iannucci's new show would seem to be a radical departure from the acrid, of-the-moment political satire of ""Veep"" and his earlier British series ""The Thick of It."" (Several of those shows' writers, including Simon Blackwell, Tony Roche and Will Smith, have joined him on ""Avenue 5."")

But there are recognizably Iannuccian things about this space-com, which debuts Sunday. Like the politicians and operatives guiding the ship of state in ""Veep,"" the crew members of the Avenue 5 are an often amoral, small-minded and quarrelsome bunch whose constant sniping provides the bulk of the humor. Leading them is a captain, played by the ""Veep"" alumnus Hugh Laurie, who, like Vice President Selina Meyer, is not ideally qualified for his post.

And there does seem to be satirical intent in ""Avenue 5,"" although one of the show's major problems, through four of the season's nine episodes, is that it's hard to tell what the targets are."

It sounds far-fetched, but to those who drew the blueprints for a new condominium in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, it did.

""Everyone knows the site was a gas station for a long time, which meant the corner was open,"" said Harry Kendall, a partner of BKSK Architects. That openness led the architectural firm to incorporate large wraparound windows at 325 Henry Street, a four-story, eight-unit residential building that will soon rise on the corner of Atlantic Avenue.

From the inside, the large black steel windows will help the living and dining rooms feel like a loft space, Mr. Kendall said. The large amount of glass also creates an openness from the street level, where you would normally see brick, or typical 19th-century bearing wall construction that yields a solid corner, he added.

""You don't want to erase the open space the gas station provided,"" Mr. Kendall said.

The windows become smaller as they go down Henry Street and Atlantic Avenue, so the building, which sits within the borders of the Cobble Hill Historic District, will contextually start to mirror the surrounding historic buildings, he said."

Ms. Redstone, 66, keeps a much lower profile. Beneath the surface, they had a lot in common. Both were lawyers before they embarked on second careers in media, and their fine-print skills served them well as they worked out multibillion-dollar agreements on era-defining mergers and acquisitions. They also shared an iron will that helped Ms. Redstone to succeed her father as the leader of the family empire. Their main sticking point was one that plagues many family businesses: succession. At the height of the conflict -- when the patriarch was well into his 80s and still a Hollywood force -- Mr. Redstone tried to buy out his daughter and publicly stated that she was not qualified to lead National Amusements, the parent company of Viacom and CBS, which he had inherited from his father and built into a giant.

Before she joined the family business, Ms. Redstone went to law school at Boston University, got married, raised three children, baked cookies and worked as a criminal defense lawyer at a small Boston firm. She also pursued a degree in social work after volunteering at a trauma center for abused children. For many years, she stayed away from National Amusements, a company that started as a string of drive-in theaters. Even when she was named its president in 1999, Mr. Redstone was unequivocally the boss. In a prelude to the difficulties to come, the father and daughter had a disagreement over the worth of the company behind Mortal Kombat, a video game that pits opponents against each other in anything-goes combat.

Mr. Redstone had not been incorrect in perceiving, way back in 1983, that video games would be a significant part of the entertainment industry's future. Over a 25-year period, he poured more than $500 million into Midway. But in the early 2000s, a time when National Amusements was in peril, Ms. Redstone objected to her father's penchant for plowing money into the company; and she was not thrilled when he installed her on the Midway board in 2004. Five years later, Midway filed for bankruptcy, leaving the headstrong mogul and his headstrong daughter with one less thing to fight about. By then, though, tensions were mounting. Mr. Redstone, who once told a reporter that his daughter was ""the love of my life,"" dangled the possibility of her winning control of his empire -- only to pull back when she seemed to be gaining power and influence. The two often clashed over executive compensation and board member selection.

In 2006, Ms. Redstone became nonexecutive vice chairwoman of both CBS and Viacom. The next year, the succession tussle went public when Mr. Redstone told a reporter that he wanted the CBS and Viacom boards to choose his successor. He called his daughter ""a credible candidate,"" while also floating the notion of buying her out. In 2008, Mr. Redstone announced that his daughter would leave the boards of Viacom and CBS. For good measure, he said she ""isn't qualified"" to fill his shoes. Ms. Redstone did not wither. She cast the sole vote against his plan to renegotiate $800 million in debt. She refocused her attention on Advancit Capital, an investment firm she co-founded in 2011.

By then, a new combatant had entered the fray: Brent Redstone, Shari Redstone's brother, who sued their father in 2006, seeking to break up National Amusements while claiming that he had been cast aside in favor of his sister. The case was eventually settled. The succession issue simmered in the background during periods of estrangement between father and daughter. During a low point in 2015, Ms. Redstone wrote in an email to her son that ""your grandfather says I will be chair over his dead body."" The ups and downs were complicated by his illness and his tabloid-fodder private life. While the aging lion took his meals through a feeding tube in his Beverly Park mansion, Ms. Redstone battled Manuela Herzer, his former lover and live-in caretaker, for control of his daily care. In 2015, Vanity Fair published an article on Ms. Herzer and another of Mr. Redstone's late-life paramours, Sidney Holland. In the article, they both gushed about the gifts and money they had been given. Things got messier when Mr. Redstone took Ms. Herzer and Ms. Holland to court, accusing them of elder abuse, and the two women countered by suing Ms. Redstone, claiming she had turned her father against them. Around that time, Ms. Redstone and Mr. Redstone made peace. As she cared for him in the mansion, he communicated through an iPad that was configured with three replies: yes, no and an unprintable term he used to express affection.

Father and daughter also joined forces to fight the Viacom board, which challenged Mr. Redstone's mental competency in court in 2016. Mr. Redstone's death has bolstered his daughter's influence over National Amusements. His voting stock in the company -- an 80 percent share -- will transfer to a seven-member trust that includes Ms. Redstone and her son, Tyler Korff, along with Jill Krutick, a longtime family friend, and four lawyers with ties to the Redstones. Ms. Redstone holds the remaining 20 percent of National Amusements through a separate trust. The main trust owns controlling shares in National Amusements, which in turn controls about 80 percent of the voting rights in ViacomCBS, the company that resulted from a 2019 merger led by Ms. Redstone. The structure of the empire built by Mr. Redstone is complex -- but Ms. Redstone is at the top. Father-daughter duos are rare in the upper echelons of corporate America, and combative ones even more so, said Rita McGrath, a professor at Columbia Business School and the head of its Women in Leadership program. She noted that Hugh Hefner had a long working relationship with his daughter, Christie Hefner, who was chief executive of Playboy Enterprises for 20 years; and that Abigail Johnson took over Fidelity Investments in 2014, after her father, Edward Johnson III, ran the business for nearly four decades. The Redstones operated more like a wolf pack, Ms. McGrath said. ""You can only have so many alphas in one room,"" she said. Ms. McGrath pointed to Ms. Redstone's skill in assembling allies under pressure, adding, ""She was actually incredibly effective at pulling together a coalition of very smart people who were willing to challenge Sumner, who were basically betting their careers that she'd be able to come out on top. Forty years ago, you wouldn't be seeing people taking that kind of bet on a woman."" In May 2019, Ms. Redstone made an appearance at a lavish fete at the Plaza hotel thrown by CBS to court business during its annual presentation to advertisers. A receiving line of network executives and on-air stars lined up to greet her as trays of mini cheeseburgers and pinot noir circulated."
46484,Sometimes Seeing More Endangered Tigers Isn't a Good Sign,"The concentration of Sumatran tigers in Indonesia's protected forests has gone up, a researcher says, but probably because they are fleeing deforestation elsewhere.","An observed uptick in tiger population density in Sumatra's protected forests may result from the endangered cats fleeing unprotected nearby forests, according to a new study.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/06/science/06TB-TIGERS1/06TB-TIGERS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=679194e507f554fea3c0d83bd27f4a1e46eb18ab9cf8b75f3cc84ee1ef2aa4ac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/science/sumatran-tigers.html,d8f731ee-ec00-5fa4-a024-9fbf19875f4f.jpg,"Sumatran tigers can't seem to catch a break. This week, a study containing good news about the population of this endangered cat also carried a disclaimer that there was probably no cause for optimism. The new study, published Tuesday in Nature Communications, relied on images from more than 300 trap cameras as well as data from decades of similar studies. The authors reported that tiger density in Sumatra's three largest protected forests increased 5 percent per year from 1996 to 2014, suggesting that Indonesia's preservation efforts are slowly working. However, the increase was probably caused by an influx of tigers fleeing unprotected forests on the large western island in the Indonesian archipelago, where their numbers are dropping rapidly, the researchers said.

That means small gains in the protected areas are probably dwarfed by the species' overall decline. ""Densities have increased, but that has not reduced the threat of extinction, because the habitat is being cut down and fragmented,"" said Matthew Luskin, a research fellow with the Smithsonian Institute in Singapore and an author of the study. ""You're basically packing more tigers into smaller areas.""

Though no one knows exactly how many Sumatran tigers remain, estimates range from about 400 to 500, down from 1,000 in 1978. The animals are only on Sumatra, where their rain forest habitat is quickly being replaced by rubber and palm oil plantations. Tigers are particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because they require expansive territories for hunting.The researchers estimated the Sumatran tiger's home range to be about 150 miles, which is large even by tiger standards. ""These tigers cover an insane amount of area every day,"" Dr. Luskin said. Poachers also pose a serious threat to the species' survival. ""A single tiger on the black market is worth well over $1,000, which is often more than the annual income of a person in these communities,"" he said.

In 2014, as a graduate student with the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Luskin mounted close to 300 motion-activated cameras throughout Sumatran forests, then used the tigers' distinct markings to track individuals. He found that the concentration of tigers outside the protected parks was 70 percent lower than in the protected areas. He also found that density varied considerably from park to park, suggesting some parks are better than others at keeping out poachers. But Dr. Luskin couldn't draw conclusions about changes in tiger density over time with only a single year of data. And data from previous studies had to be recalculated in order to standardize estimates of tiger density. That effort showed that overall tiger density had decreased by 17 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as density in the protected forests was inching upward. And because the overall decline is driven by loss of habitat, some of the growth in the parks is probably just tigers fleeing the forest. ""When you cut down forest, the tigers all move inward,"" said Dr. Luskin. Stopping deforestation would stop the tiger's decline, Dr. Luskin said. But the continuing demand for palm oil -- a common ingredient in soap, lipstick and even ice cream -- makes that difficult. ""The production is so profitable, and everyone in these landscapes just wants to grow more."""

He doesn't want the viewer -- you -- to turn the title of one of his dances into a word, but rather to sound it out: ""Bzzz."" (Get carried away with the z's.)

""It's hilarious at production meetings,"" Mr. Teicher said. ""Suddenly, we're all making the 'bzzz' sound.""

The dance, part of Caleb Teicher & Company's performance at Lincoln Center Out of Doors on Aug. 2, is a collaboration with the beatboxer Chris Celiz, who performs onstage with seven dancers. ""His voice -- the different colors he can bring out, the different expressive capacities and the expanse of what he's capable of doing really interests me,"" Mr. Teicher said. ""Tap dance is a relatively limited instrument tonally. The goal of tap dance is to expand and do as many things as you can with a pretty specific instrument.""

Mr. Celiz, essentially a vocal percussionist, is doing the same with his voice: ""There's also a lot of similarities in the way that beatboxers play,"" Mr. Teicher said. ""They play externally with rhythm and with timing and with pattern, and they also play internally -- they explore things that only other beatboxers understand."""

He was 90. Simon McBurney, the British actor and a friend of Mr. Berger's, confirmed his death to The Associated Press. As the host of ""Ways of Seeing,"" with his shaggy hair and tieless, loud-patterned shirt, Mr. Berger was a public intellectual who became a countercultural celebrity in 1970s Britain, where the BBC kept the four-part series in frequent rotation. The book became an art-school standard on both sides of the Atlantic.

Mr. Berger's intention was to upend what he saw as centuries of elitist critical tradition that evaluated artworks mostly formally, ignoring their social and political context, and the series came to be seen as an assault on the historian Kenneth Clark's lofty ""Civilisation,"" the landmark 1969 BBC series about the glories of Western art. Among many other subjects, Mr. Berger burrowed into the sexism underpinning the tradition of the nude; the place of high art in an image-saturated modern world; the relationship between art and advertising; and, of particular importance to him as a voice of the British New Left, the way traditional oil painting celebrated wealth and materialism. ""Oil painting did to appearances what capital did to social relations,"" he wrote. ""It reduced everything to the equality of objects. Everything became exchangeable because everything became a commodity."" In academic circles the book became, as one art historian described it, the equivalent of Mao's Little Red Book, and it went on to sell more than a million copies, never going out of print. Mr. Berger's methods, influenced by the ideas of Walter Benjamin, tended to attract either ardent admiration or seething criticism, with little in between.

Susan Sontag once wrote that ""in contemporary English letters he seems to me peerless."" Stephen Spender, on the other hand, called him ""a foghorn in a fog"" (a condemnation that Mr. Berger wryly spun into a compliment, asking what could be more useful in a fog). The critic Hilton Kramer complained that his brand of Marxism was not about real political problems but about provoking ""social guilt among the comfortable, cultivated consumers of high culture."" John Peter Berger was born in London on Nov. 5, 1926, and raised in only moderate comfort, with little high culture, in what he described as a working-class home. His father, Stanley, a minor public official, and his mother, Miriam, managed to send him to private school, but he hated it and spent most of his time writing poetry and reading an anarchist weekly newspaper. He ran away from school at 16 and began studying art, continuing at Chelsea School of Art, now Chelsea College of Arts, after a stint in the Army. Mr. Berger (pronounced BER-jer) wanted to be a painter but found that he was much better at writing. For a decade he was an art critic for The New Statesman, where he made a name for himself by antagonizing nearly everyone in the art world in prose that was beautifully spare and precise but heavily moralizing and also frequently humorless. He was a champion of realism during the rise of Abstract Expressionism, and he took on giants like Jackson Pollock, whom he criticized as a talented failure for being unable to ""see or think beyond the decadence of the culture to which he belongs."" But his love for favorite artists -- among them Rembrandt, Velazquez, van Gogh and Frida Kahlo -- was expressed with a fervor and depth of intelligence matched by few critics of his generation.

The year 1972 was Mr. Berger's most prolific, with ""Ways of Seeing"" and the publication of his most critically acclaimed novel, ""G.,"" about the political awakening of a Lothario in pre-World War I Europe, which was awarded the Booker Prize. (Characteristically, Mr. Berger criticized the company that sponsored the prize, saying that it exploited Caribbean workers, and announced that he would split his winnings with the Black Panthers.) In 1974, when his critical influence was probably at its height in Britain, he left London for Paris and then Geneva. He later decided to leave cities altogether, moving to a remote peasant community, Quincy, in the French Alps, where he lived with his wife, Beverly Bancroft, who died in 2013, and their son, Yves. (Besides his son, he is survived by another son, Jacob, and a daughter, Katya, from a previous marriage.) In the Alps, where he learned to raise cattle, he wrote a trilogy of unconventional books called ""Into Their Labors"" -- comminglings of short story, poetry and essay -- examining the migration of peasants away from their traditions and into cities. He also successfully dabbled in screenwriting, collaborating with the director Alain Tanner on three films, including the critically praised ""Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000"" (1976) about a group of radical idealists trying to stay true to their principles. His novel ""From A to X"" was longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2008, and in 2016, Mr. Berger was the subject of an anthology documentary, ""The Seasons in Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger,"" directed in part by the actress Tilda Swinton, a friend. Despite his many forays into hard-to-classify forms of writing, he returned again and again to the essay, the bedrock of his reputation, whose underlying theme was almost always the impossibility of disentangling the aesthetic from the moral: A 1992 piece described the annual task of mucking the pit beneath his outhouse, an odious job but one that offered many of the same lessons that great art had taught him. ""Nothing in the nature around us is evil,"" he wrote. ""This needs to be repeated since one of the human ways of talking oneself into inhuman acts is to cite the supposed cruelty of nature."" ""The just-hatched cuckoo, still blind and featherless, has a special hollow like a dimple on its back,"" he continued, ""so that it can hump out of the nest, one by one, its companion fledglings."""

Barbra Streisand Can't Get Trump Out of Her Head. So She Sang About Him.



Barbra Streisand has a new album, one that is the musical embodiment of her singular dislike of President Trump, and the rare instance of her political views entering her music. One track already released, ""Don't Lie to Me,"" is a direct address to her fellow native New Yorker who now holds the Oval Office. There are similar messages throughout the album, ""Walls,"" due on Friday, which also includes a medley of John Lennon's ""Imagine"" and Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World."" The title track warns that people now ""build them where they shouldn't be.""

In a phone interview from California, Streisand spoke to The New York Times about a range of topics, from her music to presidential power to the remake of ""A Star Is Born"" to pancakes. But her politics engulfed her. She answered questions about the #MeToo movement by discussing Hillary Clinton's loss and her belief that Senator Al Franken, the Minnesota Democrat, should not have quit after he was accused of groping or trying to kiss several women. A question about her last visit to Brooklyn elicited a rumination on democracy and truth. Those who recall her attacks on Senator John McCain in 2008 -- and the Arizona Republican's butchering of ""The Way We Were"" on ""Saturday Night Live"" (""Do I know how to sing? About as well as she knows how to govern America."") -- might be amused to hear her now praising the senator, her anti-Trump compatriot.

Streisand drew a blank when asked if she could think of anything positive that Trump has done. But this outspoken Democrat risks annoying, if not alienating, some of her own fans who might agree with the president on a number of issues. If she was concerned about that, she didn't express it. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. What inspired you to do this album after not being so overtly political in your art? I would lie awake at night with Trump's outrages running through my head, and I had to do another album for Columbia Records, so I thought, why not make an album about what's on my mind? And that became the title of the first song. I am so grateful to have music in my life as a way to express myself. Do artists have an obligation to be political now? My first album in 1962 or something like that, my manager was able to get me artistic control. That means no one could tell me what to sing or what to name my album or even what the cover looks like. And that's important to me.

Truth has always worked for me, so to see the truth defiled every day is very, very painful for me. I only can do what I can do. I probably will turn a lot of people off. When I'm creating an album there has to be musicality -- there has to be beauty in the music. I don't know what people are going to think when they hear what's on my mind. It may bring up things that are on their mind. ""Don't Lie to Me,"" if you don't look at the video, can be a more general idea. But the music is upbeat, the music is interesting, it's nice for me, kind of a contemporary track. And it expressed my anger, it expressed my frustration. I can only be true to me as an artist and if people like it that's great, and if they don't, they don't have to buy it or listen to it. But me in real life is more important than me as the artist. As a citizen, that's the role. What about offending Trump fans who like your music? It doesn't matter. I remember being onstage in Washington, D.C., and asking, ""I'm just curious, how many Republicans are in the audience?"" because everyone knows I'm a staunch Democrat, and a lot of people raised their hands. Art or music transcends politics, I think. I hope it does. I actually said that to George Bush. Can you think of anything good Trump has done? [Very long pause] I mean, this is a man who's kind of, not kind of -- he's mean. I worry about the children. I worry about what is the image he's projecting to them. How do you feel about how the music industry has dealt with #MeToo? The music industry, I didn't have a lot of problems there. I mean, it depends on how many records you sell, you know what I'm saying, whether you're male or female. It matters more in directing. The idea of being in control doesn't go over well.

Are you glad women are fighting back? I'm glad they're fighting back, although when it comes to somebody like Al Franken, I'm dismayed and I think he was right when he said at the beginning, I'll resign when Trump resigns, for somebody, too, who has been accused of assaulting at least three women and he's the president of the United States. What was the evolution of this album? Originally I was going to call the album ""What's on My Mind."" I try to always go back to ideas that are more universal that people can relate to. [The songwriters] wrote the most beautiful words about what I was thinking. You know it's interesting, I had a conversation with Bob Dole recently. Do you speak with him frequently? I've never spoken to him before. But actually I got a call from President Clinton's office that said Bob Dole would like to speak with you, and they said, would you speak with him? [Dole reached out via the former president's office because of the Clintons' relationship with Streisand.] I said, of course I'll speak with him. Bob Dole was so lovely, he said to me that he was recuperating from a yearlong illness and he wanted to tell me how powerfully my music helped him recuperate.

And he reminded me of how when he was the leader of the Senate, he was always crossing the aisle and working with George Mitchell. McCain, I was fond of John McCain. In other words, you can agree to disagree. [Returning to an earlier question about Trump] He's a great marketer. You asked me what I think he's good at? He's good at marketing. No, but when I was editing my last TV special for Netflix and we were looking at audience shots, there he was sitting next to Barbara Walters, but he never came backstage to see me or meet me. So I never met him. Does it surprise you to think that both you and he came from the same city? No, because I think that's great about New York. I mean, I didn't know people from the Bronx. I lived in Brooklyn. Bronx people seemed different than Brooklyn people. When was the last time you were back in Brooklyn? When I sang at the Barclays Center, I asked the driver to drive me around Williamsburg. I wanted to see. But he never got to Pulaski Street [a childhood home, in Bedford-Stuyvesant]. By the way, what I think he's really doing now, is trying to reverse reality. When you say something loud enough and long enough people will believe you. Doesn't democracy hinge on the truth?

Have you seen the ""A Star Is Born"" remake? I haven't seen it completed. Bradley [Cooper] did show me the opening. I was surprised by how similar it was to my version. I loved how he used the drag bar. I thought that was new and interesting. What I've seen of the film I really liked. How are you feeling these days? I want to sleep nights, if we take the House I'll be able to sleep a little bit better. Don't know. I've been thinking about, do I want to move to Canada? I don't know. I'm just so saddened by this thing happening to our country. It's making me fat. I hear what he said now, and I have to go eat pancakes now, and pancakes are very fattening. We make them with healthy flour, though -- almond flour, coconut flour."

The policy she had was from the same insurer that covers her now, but it did not pay for doctor visits, except for a yearly checkup and gynecological exam. ""I couldn't even go to my regular doctor when was I sick,"" said Ms. Arkison, 53, a self-employed horseback-riding teacher in Saline, Mich. The plan did not cover her exams before and after hip surgery, her physical therapy after her operation, the crutches she needed while she recovered, or any of her medications. She estimates that she spent $20,000 on medical care in the seven years before she could buy a plan through the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. As Senate Republican leaders struggle to secure enough votes to repeal and replace the health law, the centerpiece of their effort to win conservative support is a provision that would allow insurers to sell such bare-bones plans again. The new version of the bill released on Thursday incorporates an idea from Senator Ted Cruz of Texas that would permit insurers to market all types of plans as long as they offer ones that comply with Affordable Care Act standards. The measure would also allow companies to take into account people's health status in determining whether to insure them and at what price.

State insurance regulators say the proposal harks back to the days when insurance companies, even household names like Aetna and Blue Cross, sold policies so skimpy they could hardly be called coverage at all. Derided as ""junk insurance,"" the plans had very low premiums but often came with five-figure deductibles. Many failed to pay for medical care that is now deemed essential. One Aetna plan, for example, defined hospitalization coverage as mainly for room and board. It capped coverage at $10,000 for ""other hospital services,"" a category that included such routine care as medication and operating room expenses. The Affordable Care Act drastically changed the health insurance landscape by requiring insurers to offer a set of comprehensive benefits -- including hospitalization, doctor visits, prescription drugs, maternity care and mental health and substance abuse treatment -- in order to formally qualify as insurance. ""The new bill opens the door to junk insurance,"" said Dave Jones, the California insurance commissioner. Ned Scott, 34, who lives in Tucson, said the health plan he had before the Affordable Care Act left him with $40,000 to $50,000 in unpaid medical bills after he learned he had testicular cancer when he was in his late 20s. ""I thought it would cover things,"" Mr. Scott said. But once he needed it, he learned the plan limited what it paid for outpatient care to $2,000 a year, and all of his treatment, from chemotherapy to CT scans, seemed to fall in that category.

Many Republicans, including President Trump, say giving insurers the leeway to offer less-comprehensive plans will give people greater choice and cheaper options. The Senate bill ""ensures consumers have the freedom to choose among more affordable plans that are tailored to their individual health care needs,"" Mr. Cruz said. Proponents of the bill argue that it would allow people to buy insurance they could not otherwise afford. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said he supported the idea of allowing insurers to sell plans that do not comply with the rules under the Affordable Care Act. The current proposal, Mr. Flake told The Arizona Republic in a recent interview, would allow ""183,000 Arizonans who can't afford insurance because it's just too expensive to buy a product that meets their needs.""

But both consumer advocates and insurers -- forces that are not often allied -- are wary. They predict that healthy, younger people would most likely gravitate to the cheaper policies, believing they do not need the more comprehensive and expensive coverage, while older people with health conditions would see their premiums soar for more comprehensive plans. On Friday evening, the insurance industry's two main trade associations, America's Health Insurance Plans and BlueCross BlueShield Association, sent a letter to the Senate voicing adamant opposition to the plan, which they say would create two distinct markets. The proposal ""is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market,"" the groups wrote. Plans with much lower premiums are certain to be attractive to many people. But Elizabeth Imholz, a health policy expert for Consumers Union, warned, ""The reality for consumers is that they can be stuck with huge, unexpected out-of-pocket costs."" The Republican proposal also encourages the sale to small businesses of cheaper, less-comprehensive plans modeled after so-called association health plans that were in vogue decades ago, allowing associations or groups of like businesses to come together to buy insurance. The Republican bill would allow small businesses and people who are self-employed to buy plans that would be largely exempt from the current Affordable Care Act rules as well as state oversight.

That, too, has drawn concern. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents state regulators, wrote a letter to the Senate contending that the provision ""appears to block the ability of states to preserve important consumer protections, effectively oversee the plans, or ensure a level playing field."" Association plans, which had been virtually unregulated because they were not under the purview of any state rules, have had a mixed history. Some plans failed because they did not have the money to pay for their customers' medical bills, while some insurance companies were accused of misleading people about what they would cover. These plans are ""just the classic example of insurance that disappears exactly when you need it,"" said Jay Angoff, a former state insurance official in Missouri and New Jersey, who also worked in the Obama administration overseeing the insurance marketplace. Antony Stuart, a lawyer who lives in California, has brought more than a dozen lawsuits accusing insurance companies of misleading consumers by selling them policies that provided much less coverage than they realized. Mr. Stuart recalled one case involving a man, Doug Christensen, who bought a policy from Mega Life and Health Insurance, which was the subject of numerous lawsuits and state regulatory actions. Mr. Christensen, who previously had bone cancer, was assured by the insurance agent selling the policy that he would have adequate coverage if the cancer returned. But the plan limited payments toward chemotherapy to just $1,000 a day of treatment when the actual cost was sometimes 10 times that amount. Mr. Christensen was left with nearly $500,000 in unpaid medical bills. ""These plans lacked the necessary transparency that would give consumers an idea of what they were actually purchasing,"" said Ashley Blackburn, a senior policy analyst with Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy group. People buying plans now benefit not only from the standards the federal law sets but also from the fact that policies are clearly divided into categories with set levels of coverage. ""We're really moving back to a market where people are going to have a hard time reading through their plan options."" The association plans, in particular, would make small businesses and self-employed individuals more vulnerable to policies that would leave them unprotected. State regulators cracked down after some of these plans became insolvent. Four associations in the early 2000s left their customers with nearly $50 million in unpaid medical bills, according to researchers in an overview of the plans' history published in the journal Health Affairs.

Many states adopted a more aggressive stance as a result, but the Senate proposal would make plans largely exempt from state oversight. ""There are a lot of consumer protection laws that states have passed that would have to be overruled or ignored,"" said Rebecca Owen, a health research actuary with the Society of Actuaries. A few weeks ago, Ms. Arkison came down with a bad cough. Her doctor prescribed antibiotics, steroids and an inhaler. She is thankful that her current insurance lets her see the doctor when she becomes ill. Under her old plan, she said, ""I could not have gone in."""

Cobra, CSX2000, landed, heralding the emergence of an automotive sex symbol and a racetrack legend from a modest display stand at the New York auto show. Cannily resprayed pearlescent yellow, from its original blue, to give journalists visiting the Coliseum convention center on Columbus Circle the impression that full-scale production had begun, it was well received, though hardly the only attraction of that 1962 show. Competition came in many shapely forms, including the Studebaker Avanti and from a design study done for the Chevrolet Corvette, the XP-755. Few could have imagined that the upstart Cobra, the unlikely offspring of England's venerable but tiny A.C. Cars (making cars since at least 1904) and a relentlessly ambitious Texan, Carroll Shelby -- a World War II pilot turned chicken farmer turned racecar driver turned chronically undercapitalized sports car constructor -- would continue stirring enthusiasts' souls well into the next century. Desperately expensive now, Shelby Cobras didn't set sales records when new; only 998 were built in 1962-67, in two basic versions. Starting around $6,000 and reaching upwards of $8,000, they were beyond the reach of most enthusiasts, though they could be ordered at selected Ford dealerships. Cobras were anachronisms even when new, with clumsy side curtains in place of roll-up windows, a challenging erect-it-yourself convertible top and the bare minimum of ventilation or safety equipment. By almost any logical measure, Corvettes and Jaguar E-Types were infinitely more practical high-speed grand touring cars.

Yet with voluptuous lines that continue to transcend time, blistering performance and immediate success on the racetrack, the Cobra readily achieved canonization in the car-collecting church. For decades, original Shelbys have been among the bluest of blue-chip classics, with fine examples selling today for $600,000. Owners of cars with exceptional provenance or noteworthy racing histories might comfortably ask twice that much. The Cobra's desirability has also given rise to an entire industry of knockoffs. Very likely, no single model of car has ever been so widely copied, with Cobra clones, replicas and kits of varying degrees of authenticity and quality peddled through the decades. Even Mr. Shelby -- now 89 years old and the recipient of successful heart and kidney transplants -- has long dabbled in the action, selling official re-creations of the Cobra, authorizing some made by third parties while damning others and hauling those who he feels are infringing on the design into court. And he remains involved in the business of modifying Ford Mustangs, an effort begun in 1965 with the Shelby GT 350. Next week at the New York auto show, his company will introduce the Shelby 1000, a 950-horsepower, $150,000 package of enhancements for the 2012 Mustang GT500. The Cobra production car and all the fame it brought may owe as much to a medical condition as to Mr. Shelby's lust for speed. The smooth-talking racer's career was ascendant, capped by an outright win at Le Mans in 1959 driving an Aston Martin, when cut short by a congenital heart ailment that had plagued him intermittently since childhood.

Mr. Shelby hung up his helmet, choosing to pursue the recurring but seemingly impossible American dream of successfully marketing a car with his own name on it. Influenced by the Allard racecars of the early 1950s, which established the competitive possibility of big American engines in lightweight English bodies, Mr. Shelby confidently approached General Motors for supplies of its new small-block V-8 and Donald Healey for the Austin-Healey rolling chassis. He was, in both instances, rebuffed. But timing is everything. Mr. Shelby learned that Bristol, a British carmaker, had ended production of the 6-cylinder engine used in A.C.'s aging sports car, the Ace (a successful sideline to A.C.'s main business: building low-powered cars for beginning drivers and invalids). Mr. Shelby was quickly in front of A.C. directors with a proposal. The Cobra, whose name Mr. Shelby has said came to him years earlier in a dream, was on its way. In February 1962 an unpainted Ace, its chassis modified to withstand a doubling of its horsepower but sans engine, arrived at the Santa Fe Springs, Calif., shop of Dean Moon, a maker of performance equipment. Within hours, a new V-8 lent by Ford had been installed, and soon the glittering predictions of the performance potential of this Anglo-American mongrel were borne out on local streets.

When production began, A.C. shipped Cobras ready for installation of the 260-cubic-inch Ford V-8, suitably upgraded for the car (before long, the 289-cubic-inch engine became standard). A Shelby insignia was added, as were, by contract, fender badges reading Powered by Ford, words that also appeared in print ads and brochures for the new roadster. Outside the United States, the cars were marketed as A.C. Cobras, with no mention of Shelby or his patron. Confident that winning on the racetrack would establish the Cobra's credentials and spur demand, Mr. Shelby arranged for the second car off the production line to go racing. After some initial teething troubles, success followed with a stellar roster of early '60s greats, including Dan Gurney, Phil Hill and Bob Bondurant, behind the Cobras' large wood-rim steering wheels. For a memorable moment in American sports car racing history, the Cobra was king, its fame nourished by Shelby's shrewd marketing hand. Cobras were featured prominently in Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"" and ""Spinout"" films, and provided the theme (and cover image) of the Rip Chords' 1964 hit single, ""Hey Little Cobra."" Not for nothing was Shelby building cars in America's new entertainment capital. Like many racers of his day, Mr. Shelby set his sights on beating the cars of Enzo Ferrari. He assigned Peter Brock, a former General Motors designer who had been running a Shelby performance driving school, to design an aerodynamic fastback coupe capable of winning on European tracks. Only six examples of Brock's Daytona Coupe were originally built, but they cemented the Cobra's majesty, winning the F.I.A. World Manufacturers' GT Championship in 1965, making Shelby's the only American car to collect the honor. Collector-car price guides value the Daytona Coupe at around $10 million today. Rarity, sex appeal, competition success -- and epic branding conjured by a charismatic Texan who can be equal parts snake charmer and snake oil salesman -- the Cobra has it all. But the legend would not be complete without a reference to its persistent, history-making oversupplies of horsepower. As the veteran car tester Tom McCahill pithily wrote of the new machine in Mechanix Illustrated in August 1963, here was a potential Le Mans winner you could buy at the neighborhood Ford dealer ""that will snap Gramp's head right off his shoulders if you hit the go pedal when he isn't ready."" Squarely in the middle of Detroit's horsepower wars, Mr. Shelby and his team knew that no matter how fast their car was, its performance advantage wouldn't last as competitors upped the ante. After 655 original-formula Cobras had been assembled, a new model arrived for 1965. Deploying Ford's 427-cubic-inch V-8, the Cobra anticipated the challenge of big-block Corvettes, coupling a more extreme overdose of power to wider tires and the almost cartoonishly bulging bodywork needed to cover them.

Gone were the original cars' reedy ladder frame and transverse leaf-spring suspension. In their place was a stout tubular chassis, with a modern coil-spring independent suspension, fat Goodyear tires and improved braking. The engineering work, done with the help of Ford supercomputers, was intended to rein in the veritable Saturn moon rocket residing under the 427's hood. This new Cobra, Car and Driver reported with equal measures of approval and amazement in November 1965, remained a crude appliance. But it was fast without precedent, traveling from zero to 100 m.p.h. and back to zero again in less than 14 seconds. This at a moment in history when it took many new cars 14 seconds or more to wheeze their way up to 60. The revamped Cobras may have handled better than their predecessors, but with a minimum of 355 horsepower and a weight of only 2,529 pounds, 427's were even trickier to drive. So fast, Car and Driver advised, that under hard acceleration one might break traction at speeds up to 100 m.p.h., while injudicious stabs at the gas pedal at any velocity could ""send the tail-end slewing sideways."" The admiring conclusion that the 427 ""is not an automobile for novices"" remains as true as it ever was. A mere 343 of the 427 Cobras, including two twin-supercharged models with automatic transmissions, were built before production ceased. By 1967, Mr. Shelby's competition focus had moved on to Ford's purpose-built racecar, the midengine GT40, and he was busy building Shelby Mustangs, even as federal emissions controls and safety regulations loomed. The Cobra, still very much a product of the 1950s, was never going to make it into the '70s. Then somehow, not unlike its creator, it managed to live forever."

We almost certainly spread the fungus that's killing them.,"A young grey-headed flying fox in Victoria, Australia. Ancient literature and folklore record a long list of anti-bat beliefs. Some people also blame bats for carrying dangerous pathogens, including, potentially, the precursor of the new coronavirus.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/10/opinion/10bat4/10bat4-facebookJumbo.jpg,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/opinion/covid-bats.html,ceb892d7-6d5a-5812-82d8-f1ad6f76f9f8.jpg,"The order of animals known as Chiroptera, the bats, enjoys a mixed reputation among humans. I'm putting this politely: They have been calumniated and abused for centuries. Some people, mainly from the comfort of distance and ignorance, find bats repellent and spooky. Some people fear them, with or without rational grounds. Bats are sometimes slaughtered in large numbers, defenseless at their collective roosts, when people deem them menacing, inconvenient, noxious or desirable as food. The idea of bat soup or roasted bat may induce cringes in sensitive Western eaters, but that's no consolation to the tens of thousands of flying foxes (as the largest of the Old World fruit bats are known) that have been legally hunted for meat and sport in Malaysia in recent years. Or to the Mariana fruit bat, pushed toward oblivion not just by habitat loss in Guam and neighboring islands, but also by the introduction of a tree snake that preys upon them and a tradition among the local Chamorro people of eating them as a celebratory meal. Almost 200 bat species around the world are threatened with extinction.

Ancient literature and folklore record a long list of anti-bat beliefs: that they were turncoats in the primordial battle between Birds and Beasts, that they curdled the eggs of storks, that they gouged bites out of hams hung for curing, that they entangled themselves in women's hair, that they were accomplices to Satan in his effort to seize control of human nature, that bat blood could serve as an antidote to snakebite and all manner of other silly stuff. The association of vampirism with bats, though, is no myth. Three species of small, sneaky New World bats are adapted to feeding exclusively on blood from birds and oblivious mammals -- originally wildlife, but now also cows, horses and humans asleep with their feet exposed. The most conspicuous of them is the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, known from Uruguay to Mexico and especially abundant in southeastern Brazil. These sanguinivorous bats have heat sensors in their noses for locating capillary concentrations, sharp incisors for slicing flesh, anticoagulant saliva -- the whole deal. Like furry mosquitoes. The ""rotundus"" (portly) in their scientific name reflects the fact that after they've crept across the ground to nip the ankles of cattle and drink blood, they become so fat from a night's meal (burp), that they must piss away the plasma, retaining the red cells, before they can be airborne and get back to their roost. From there it's a short flight to ""Dracula.""

Some people also blame bats for the dangerous pathogens they carry -- including, potentially, the precursor of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. That virus may have gotten into us from one of the several kinds of horseshoe bat from southern China. If so, the fateful event probably had more to do with what some human wanted from bats than with what some bat wanted from humans. Bat viruses spill into humans; they don't climb into us. They don't seek us out. And the spilling generally happens when we intrude upon bats in their habitats, excavating their guano for fertilizer, capturing them, killing them or transporting them live to markets, or otherwise initiating a disruptive interaction. Scientists haven't yet discovered (and they may never) just which such encounter brought this coronavirus to humanity. But you can be confident that it didn't happen because some Chinese rufous horseshoe bat flew into Wuhan and bit a poor man on the toe. The most lethal of bat-borne viruses, for humans, is rabies, now recognized as one member of a diverse group called the lyssaviruses (as in Lyssa, the Greek goddess of frenzy and rage), most of them associated with bats. Humans have been aware of rabies at least since Democritus, in the fifth century B.C. We've seen it in our dogs, sometimes driven mad, like Old Yeller, and occasionally in an unlucky person who got bit. The fatality rate for rabies, absent prompt post-exposure vaccination, is nearly 100 percent, and the disease still kills tens of thousands of people each year. But from what original source did rabies get into dogs or raccoons or skunks or the other carnivores from whose saliva it drips into a bite wound? The first clue to that mystery came in 1911, when rabies virus was reported among bats by an Italian scientist in Brazil, Antonio Carini, who noted the odd detail that it didn't seem to make the bats sick. That suggested a long relationship between the bats and the virus, which had perhaps reached a mutual accommodation: a secure habitat for the virus, no symptoms for the host. Although rabies was the topic that dominated research in this field for much of the 20th century, a few other bat-borne viruses turned up, mostly as incidental discoveries by scientists studying something else. Rio Bravo virus, for instance, found among some California bats in 1954 and related to the yellow fever virus, was one. Tacaribe virus, carried by both bats and mosquitoes in Trinidad, was another. These viruses yielded scientific papers but not newspaper headlines, because they weren't causing human deaths. Soon, too, there appeared some new killer viruses, though without (at first) any clear linkage to bats. Marburg virus as well as the most lethal and infamous of the Ebolas, now known as Zaire ebolavirus, caused gruesome illness and death with their first recognized outbreaks among humans, during the late 1960s and 1970s. But their confirmed (Marburg) or probable (Zaire ebolavirus) connections to bats as reservoirs were not established by science until later.

Then, in 1994, a strange new bug spilled out of certain flying foxes in eastern Australia, burned its way horrifically through a stable of racehorses and killed one of the three men who had labored, shoulder-deep in bloody froth, to save those horses. A second man, a stable hand, got very sick but survived. The third man was a tall veterinarian named Peter Reid. ""That's it,"" Dr. Reid told me, a dozen years later, as we sat in his car amid a sprawl of new tract houses near Brisbane, gazing at a solitary fig tree left standing in a traffic circle. ""That's the bloody tree."" The suburb, in 1994, was a horse pasture. The bats came for the figs. The first infected horse shaded herself beneath this tree, feeding on grass splotched with virus-laced bat feces. From her it passed to the other horses and to the men. That virus got the name Hendra, after the Brisbane suburb where the horse deaths occurred. This was before it became politically unacceptable to name a nasty new virus after a place. Nipah virus, in 1998, in Malaysia, also emerged from bats, also passed through an amplifier host (pigs), also killed people and also was named for a place: the village of Sungai Nipah, home to a 51-year-old pig farmer from whose cerebrospinal fluid the virus was first isolated. The original SARS virus appeared shortly thereafter, in 2002. It, too, arose from a bat, passed possibly through palm civets, and began sickening people in Shenzhen, China. It spread alarmingly fast to other countries in 2003, with several superspreading events and a high fatality rate, but it was controlled thanks to strong public health measures, and it killed ""only"" 774 people. The SARS outbreak of 2002-03 was a galvanizing event for disease scientists, who recognized that it could have brought about a disastrous pandemic if just a few factors had differed: a slower response by public health officers, disorganized efforts of containment, or maybe a similar coronavirus but capable of spreading from asymptomatic cases. (Does all that sound familiar? It should.) Discovery of the bat-SARS link two years later moved bat-virus research, according to the eminent virologist Charles H. Calisher, ""from serendipitous, fragmented, and local, to well-planned, methodical, and global,"" with attention focused ever more strongly on bats as the reservoirs from which many nefarious viruses have emerged. That's a long list of animosities, scurrilities, grudges and indictments. So what can be said for bats, these feared and detested creatures?

Plenty can be said for them. To grasp the majesty of bats, start by imagining this: You are on a small cargo boat, chartered for 25 bucks, puttering southward across open sea among the small islands east of Komodo, in central Indonesia. There are scarcely any villages, scarcely any people, and certainly no hotels in this remote, austere bit of the archipelago. It's twilight and you're hurrying toward a safe anchorage at the lee of one of these islands, where you and the boat captain and his two sons, who constitute his crew, can sleep the night. Just before dark, a great flock of fruit bats comes out of the west, flying high, maybe a thousand of them, each as large as a raven. Most likely they are Sunda fruit bats, Acerodon mackloti, a species endemic to Indonesia, and whatever viruses they may carry have not yet caused any known harm to people. Their wings flap in easy rhythm as they move in procession, full of purpose, like migrating geese, toward their nocturnal feeding grounds on some island eastward. The dipping sun warms the sky with a last peach-colored wash. The moon is a thin crescent, and the bats cross it in silhouette, minding their own business. They are magnificent. The Sunda fruit bat is just one of what scientists tally as more than 1,400 living species of bat. That's more than any other mammalian order except the rodents and constitutes about 20 percent of all mammals. Think of it: One in every five mammals on earth, by count of species, is a bat. They must be doing something right.

Another factor is the duration of their lineage. The earliest known bat fossil dates to about 50 million years ago, and because it resembles a modern bat, the dawning of bats must have occurred well before that. The earliest flying squirrel may not have appeared until 30 million or 40 million years later, by which time bats were the mammalian masters of the air. To function at night, performing the aerial dives and swoops necessary to catch flying insects, without going hungry or continually knocking themselves silly against tree limbs or rock walls, they acquired another crucial capacity: echolocation. They became able to blast out pulses of high-frequency sound, some of them through their noses, like silent screams, and receive back the echoes with acutely sensitive ears. This allows their brains to assemble dynamic images of the size, shape, distance and motion of the zigzagging moths and plummeting katydids that are their prey. Certain of the nostril shriekers, including the horseshoe bats and the leaf-nosed bats, developed elaborate nasal structures that help focus their sonic pulses. Some others, by evolutionary increments, grew huge ears. Tomes's long-eared bat, native to forests in Central and South America, has combined both -- towering, wide ears shaped like the spinnaker on a yacht, plus a nose like the prow of a Viking ship. This makes for a face of peculiar distinction -- I would say, a face only a mother could love, except that chiroptophiles love it, too -- while the poor little animal is just trying to locate dinner.

A few of them are lovely, russet-bodied with umber wings, occasionally a golden collar. They roost mainly in trees, such as the tall karoi surrounding a certain derelict warehouse, in southern Bangladesh, where a wildlife veterinarian named Jonathan Epstein, along with his field crew and me, in 2009 found a roosting colony of 4,000 to 5,000 Indian flying foxes. Dr. Epstein had come to trap some of these animals and sample them for Nipah virus. On the first afternoon, as Dr. Epstein's two agile net-riggers climbed high into one tree, the bats stirred, woke and, spooked, rose into the sky, one after another, with what seemed calm caution, to escape the disturbance. Soon, the whole flock was airborne, circling out to the northeast, then back in, out again, back, riding the thermals with minimal wing beats, like flotsam going around in a great river eddy. I gawked up in awe and Dr. Epstein reminded me -- I can't remember if it was then or later -- that a wide-open gape beneath a caldron of such bats might be a good way to get a mouthful of Nipah-laced guano. In the wee hours of the night we returned, climbed a rickety bamboo ladder to the warehouse roof, wearing masks and goggles and gloves and headlamps, and were in position when the first bat -- now returning from its nocturnal foraging -- hit the net. Dr. Epstein, hands protected in welder's gloves from the sharp claws and teeth, held the animal in a firm grip behind its neck while a colleague untangled it. That one went into a cloth bag, and so had, by dawn, five others. Then, in a makeshift field lab, Dr. Epstein and his crew took blood samples and cheek swabs from the bats, now anesthetized, being careful not to hurt them.

""It spread really rapidly,"" she told me recently by Skype, walking on her treadmill as we spoke. I knew Dr. Frick already as a multitasking scientist a decade ago, having met her when a group of us shared dinner in a grand venue at the close of an international bat conference in Berlin and she brought along her 4-month-old son, Darwin. By now, white-nose syndrome is in 33 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, she told me, having caused a 90 percent decline in the known populations of three bat species, plus losses among at least four others. Millions of bats have died. One of the three hardest-hit species, the northern long-eared bat, she said, was ""totally gone,"" within three years, from some areas where it used to hibernate. North America's hibernating bat populations could be nearly or completely wiped out. The fungus thrives in cold, damp environments such as caves, and it takes hold on bats during their periods of torpor and hibernation, when their immune systems are inattentive, not just to viruses but also to other infections. ""You can almost think of them as being like little cold Petri dishes,"" Dr. Frick said. The fungus grows robustly, causes irritation and rouses the bats in midwinter, whereupon they fly out, expend crucial fat reserves searching for insect food that isn't there and die."

A group of four artists and fabricators unveiled themselves on Saturday as the creators of the stainless-steel curiosity that was placed atop Pine Mountain in Atascadero, Calif., on Tuesday -- and shared a YouTube video of a newly made replacement going up after some young men unceremoniously toppled the original and put a cross in its spot, livestreaming themselves in the process. ""We intended for it to be a piece of guerrilla art. But when it was taken down in such a malicious manner, we decided we needed to replace it,"" Wade McKenzie, one of the California monolith's creators, said in an interview Sunday evening. The news of the origins of the monolith was first reported by the website YourTango. McKenzie said he built the three-sided steel structure with the help of his friend Travis Kenney, Kenney's father, Randall, and Jared Riddle, a cousin of Travis Kenney.

Atascadero, a city of 30,000 people near the central coast, is the lifelong home of three of the men who installed the Pine Mountain artwork. They say the year has been trying for all of them: Business has been tough, and McKenzie's father died a few weeks ago of complications from COVID-19. From left, Wade McKenzie, Jared Riddle and Travis Kenney at the top of Pine Mountain early Tuesday with the creation they say they made. When the first monolith was found in Utah, Travis Kenney said it piqued their interest. ""We were like, 'Damn, check out this art that people are traveling hours to see!'"" he said. Both he and McKenzie identify as sci-fi geeks and are fans of ""2001."" ""After the second one popped up in Romania, we were like, 'There needs to be a third,'"" he said. ""And then we were like 'Screw it, why not us?'"" They said they built the original out of stainless steel in just a few hours on Tuesday, and carried the 10-foot-long piece two miles up the 1,300-foot mountain trail. ""Not to boast, but we motored up that thing,"" McKenzie said. ""We're all nearly 50 years old, and it proved we were all in pretty good shape to be able to carry a 200-pound piece up a mountain in a relatively short period of time."" A hiker discovered it the next morning. ""We had no idea this would go viral,"" McKenzie said. ""People were driving from four hours away from L.A. or San Francisco to see it."" After it was torn down, McKenzie said the men reached out to the mayor, Heather Moreno, offering to create a permanent installation somewhere in the city.

Yeats and William Wilde",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/09/books/09COWLES-COMBO/09COWLES-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7c952b4d0b69d5cf08fd88ac686130f1ecd8558034479fb54ccae5918d6281d4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/books/review/colm-toibin-mad-bad-dangerous-to-know.html,007cb497-ef78-5163-b1b6-b325367ac5b7.jpg,"John B. Yeats, too, provides Toibin a complicated and eccentric character study. A trained lawyer who abandoned the law to pursue his passion for painting, Yeats achieved some renown as an artist but sabotaged his ambitions through his paralyzing inability to finish what he started; a stranger, on meeting W. B. Yeats and learning who his father was, once remarked, ""O, that is the painter who scrapes out every day what he painted the day before."" This is a fairly common affliction -- among book reviewers as well as artists -- but most people who suffer it find other ways to earn a living. Not Yeats. The financial prospects for a painter who finishes few paintings are somewhat dim, and he squandered a significant inheritance before decamping to London and eventually New York at the age of 68, seven years after his wife's death. There he more or less continued to avoid painting and wrote long, fervent letters (to his children, to a love interest back in Dublin) that suggest he found it easier to be affectionate at a safe remove. That pattern recurs throughout Toibin's account: ""In this world of sons,"" he writes later, in another beautiful sentence, ""fathers become ghosts and shadows and fictions.""

Toibin pointedly contrasts W. B. Yeats's prolific output as a poet with his father's scant record as an artist, and in an interesting digression says that a comparable dynamic affected Henry James (whom Toibin inhabited so memorably in ""The Master""). ""I was alert,"" he writes, ""to the similarities between the two families -- the Jameses and the Yeatses -- and the similar ways in which two famous sons had been influenced by their father."" Among those parallels is that the sons ""specialized, unlike their fathers, perhaps in spite of their fathers, in finishing almost everything they started.""

About Joyce's father -- an overbearing but underinvolved drunkard who abused his children before eventually abandoning them -- Toibin has the least direct documentary material. Paradoxically, this section feels most alive as a result. After summarizing the basic biographical data, about John Stanislaus Joyce's marriage and children and his difficulty holding a job, Toibin runs out of narrative momentum and is forced instead to explore the father's psychological impact on his children. He plumbs a memoir and a diary by James Joyce's brother Stanislaus, then turns at last to Joyce's own writing to argue, persuasively, that the effort to understand and empathize with his father provided an abiding source of Joyce's genius: ""James Joyce,"" he writes, ""sought not only to memorialize his father but also to retrace his steps, enter his spirit, use what he needed from his father's life to nourish his own art."" And again: ""Joyce allowed a complex imagination to shine its pale, unsettled light on what had already passed into shade so that he could coax it back into substance, courtesy of style."" This is a thrilling reading that aptly unites Toibin's novelistic gifts for psychology and emotional nuance with his talents as a reader and critic, in incomparably elegant prose.

Of course, any Irish writer dealing with Wilde and Yeats and Joyce might be expected to struggle with some ""daddy"" issues himself along the way. (It's worth noting, given the other personal detours Toibin indulges, that in a book devoted to writers' fathers he nowhere mentions his own.) But as a biographer Toibin seems largely untroubled by the accomplishments of the three sons, neither competitive nor rebellious, despite some vestigial envy and ancestral pride that Wilde, Yeats and Joyce had the opportunity to define a national literature; in early-20th-century Dublin, he observes a little wistfully, ""every writer had to invent a world as though from the very beginning.""

The book unavoidably invites questions about the nature of the father-son bond -- and then mostly avoids them. That's to Toibin's credit: The three fathers' lives are so varied, and the sons' work so different, that it's hard to derive general conclusions about father-son relationships or their influence on art, and for the most part Toibin is too subtle and circumspect to try. Always an understated writer, who prefers innuendo to inflection, in this book he evinces a talent for the deadpan. (""Yeats even met the young James Joyce on the street,"" he writes at one point. ""Joyce found him 'very loquacious.'"") Where Toibin does try to force conclusions, he stumbles uncharacteristically, as when he declares, ""They created chaos, all three of these fathers, while their sons made work."" This is so broad as to be meaningless, and in any case doesn't bear scrutiny -- the sons might be said to have created plenty of chaos on their own, after all.

Is it true, as Stephen Dedalus says, that a father's legacy to his children is limited to an instant of blind rut? Sometimes, sure. But other times the connection is far deeper and more complicated, as Toibin's wise and resonant book makes clear. However fraught the relationship, however competitive or controlling or cold, sometimes even an imperfect father gives his son wings and teaches him to fly."
25169,Sharp Increase in Visitor Park Fees Proposed for the Galápagos,"With concerns growing over the impact of an exploding tourist population, officials hope the increased income will help sustainability and conservation of the archipelago.",An increase in the number of tourists visiting the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands has many experts concerned about the impact on the fragile ecosystem.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/travel/26update-galapagos/merlin_147371742_e2675f6a-d1e0-4d54-b2e6-4f2bc94c149f-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e602def741d15271e9a35bab971c543a1148b747803459e112103c6c3998ae61&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/travel/galpagos-island-park-fees.html,a99ec9ba-df0a-5372-b595-1d92a7085080.jpg,"An increase in the number of tourists visiting the Galapagos Islands has many experts concerned about the impact on the fragile ecosystem.





Visitors to the Galapagos Islands will likely pay an increased park fee starting next year, a decision that reflects growing concerns that skyrocketing tourism on the Ecuadorean archipelago is harming its fragile and unique ecosystem. Visitors currently pay a $100 fee to the Galapagos National Park, with mainland Ecuadoreans paying $6. Last month, Ecuador's ministries of tourism, environment and agriculture proposed doubling costs to $200 for those visiting the islands who also spend at least three nights in mainland Ecuador and quadrupling the fee to $400 to visit Galapagos and spend only one or two nights on the mainland. The exact prices, start date and how authorities confirm itineraries will be decided by December 31, said Daniela Tamayo Cordova, of the Galapagos Government Council, the municipal body that manages the islands. ""The entrance fee has not increased in 20 years, and costs in Galapagos and Ecuador have risen over this time,"" Ms. Cordova said. ""The increased income will be used to improve sustainability, tourist experiences, and conservation and management.""

With wider global awareness than Ecuador's tropical Amazon or mountainous Andes regions, the Galapagos are arguably the nation's crown jewel. But because these islands are hundreds of miles from the mainland, oversight comes from a hodgepodge of governing bodies, and decisions are often made in the capital, Quito. A portion of the fee currently goes to protecting the 97 percent of the uninhabited islands. That will likely continue, but just how much more will go to ecological management remains in flux. The Galapagos are not alone. Many popular areas around the world are restricting tourist traffic or increasing fees. In the United States, the National Park Service raised vehicle entrance fees last year and for more specialized travel, climbing permits to attempt Mount Everest in Nepal were recently raised after concerns of overcrowding. Galapagos tourism has nearly doubled in a decade: About 275,000 people visited the islands last year, according to the Observatorio de Turismo de Galapagos, an increase from 173,419 in 2008. The year-round population serving these visitors has increased as well. Unesco lists tourism as a primary threat to existing infrastructure and habitats and a risk to introducing invasive plant and animal species. Many of those invested in the islands, from biologists to travel operators, say the human pressure on the islands' fragile ecosystem is unprecedented.

Large-scale water filtration, proper trash collection and disposal, and rules on development are considered by many inadequate for the growing number of visitors. Enforcement of rules designed to help the wildlife and its habitat, such as keeping visitors at least six feet from endemic species like nesting blue footed boobies, patrolling adjacent waters to keep out illegal shark poachers, or curbing new hotel development, is spotty. ""There's an unsustainable level of growth in the Galapagos,"" said Jim Lutz, the president of the International Galapagos Tour Operators Association, adding that his group has been pushing for an increase in visitor fees for years. Land-based tourism grew more than 90 percent from 2007 to 2016, in part to the proliferation of cheap flights, hostels and a la carte tours that have made these once remote islands more accessible and crowded. There is no cap to the number of visitors traveling by plane, and new cheap routes catering to backpackers have been added. Then there's the sharing economy.

""Unfortunately, Airbnb opened the door for pretty much anybody who had an extra bed in their house,"" said Fernando Diez, the marketing director of Quasar Expeditions, one of the first companies to operate on the islands. The number of hotels increased to more than 300 from 65 in the last 10 years. ""People are imagining pina coladas with sea lions and partying all over,"" Mr. Diez said. ""Galapagos is not that."" Cruises, a popular way to visit the islands, have been limited in number, at least until recently. There were 70 ships with room for about 1,700 passengers in 2017. Cruise permits were once strict at 16 passengers per ship; at least half a dozen new ships debuted this year including a 100-passenger Celebrity Cruise yacht. The increase may sound minor, but even a handful of shutterbugs landing on a beach and inching close to sensitive wildlife has an impact and this change is a force multiplier."
32376,Lessons From Rust-Belt Cities That Kept Their Sheen,"A look at industrial centers of the North and the East over decades of decline finds that investments, geography and sheer serendipity make a difference.","St. Cloud, Minn., continued to be a job creator over the last few decades, sustaining its prosperity while many urban industrial areas withered. A worker applied paint to a vehicle part at a St. Cloud body shop.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/02/business/02PORTERprint1/02PORTER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=def24988badb19d19180212ca1488d105a9027fb45ad5b46bb05751ce1b5b3dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/business/economy/rust-belt-cities.html,0fd55644-5a37-5bb7-867b-d72e84ba7dde.jpg,"St. Cloud, Minn., might look at first blush like one of America's all-too-familiar ailing industrial cities, struggling to hang on to jobs as its companies skip town. Electrolux's planned closing of its chest-freezer plant next year to consolidate its operations in South Carolina was the latest blow, costing some 900 jobs. As Tama Theis, local Republican state legislator, told The Saint Cloud Times, ""Gosh dang it, that's a hard one."" And yet despite the loss of its fifth-largest employer, the sleepy city straddling the Mississippi 65 miles northwest of Minneapolis doesn't at all fit the tale of woe that spread across the Midwest over the last 50 years. If anything, St. Cloud and nearby communities in Stearns County provide the setting for a counternarrative to the story of industrial America's protracted decline. Walloped by the forces that hit every old manufacturing enclave -- from globalization and automation to a rising demand for skills -- the area sustained its prosperity through a mix of the right investments, favorable geography and sheer serendipity.

Since 1970, manufacturers in the county have added 5,000 jobs, for a total of 11,600. Total employment has tripled, to 90,000. The population has grown by more than half. And the median income of the county's households rose 20 percent from 1980 to 2016, after inflation, to $57,728 -- a smidgen above the national median. ""When Electrolux announced it was leaving, other employers were saying, 'When can we get at that labor?'"" said King Banaian, dean of the School of Public Affairs at St. Cloud State University. ""There's a tug of war going on, and workers are getting higher wages and performance incentives and bonuses and so on."" The problem is that there are too few places like St. Cloud: Grand Rapids in Michigan's Kent County, where employment more than doubled since 1970; Green Bay in Brown County, Wis., where it almost tripled. What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. Formerly vibrant industrial cities across the Midwest and Northeast today present a landscape of high unemployment and opioid addiction -- stagnant communities of old-timers in the shadow of rusting industrial hulks, angry at a political system that has ignored them and at an economy that has left them behind. Can they learn anything from places like Stearns County? Its experience may offer some tips for its struggling peers: Smart industrial zoning can give an edge to local companies; higher-education institutions can serve as anchors for economic development. But its most salient advantages come from its location and industrial mix, more to do with serendipity than policy. A lot of it, Mr. Banaian told me, may have been ""plain darn good luck.""

Using the mix of industries in each county, they projected how many jobs it would have today if employment in each industry had grown at the same pace as in the nation as a whole. Seventy of the original 185 had significantly fewer jobs in 2016 than they would have had if they had followed the national trend. The other 115 almost matched or outpaced the national trend. This is an imperfect measure of success. In many successful counties that experienced employment growth, workers nonetheless suffered lower wages and declining living standards. Still, on the whole these places did much better in terms of productivity and household income growth, too. Unfortunately for the laggards, their edge may be difficult to replicate. The picture in the South and the West is brighter. Fifty-five of the 63 urban industrial counties that Mr. Berube and Ms. Murray counted in the South in 1970, as well as all 24 of those in the West, saw jobs growth that was at least about on par with the national trend over the next 46 years. But their experience is of limited use to the North and the East. In 1970, these counties were smaller and younger. They were building an industrial base as the nation's economic footprint was shifting from manufacturing to service, embracing technology and globalization. Desegregation in the South and immigration in the West added a pool of productive workers, while investment flowed in to take advantage of their cheaper labor force and the virtual absence of unions. ""Jobs were leaving Michigan, Indiana and Ohio and going to Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee,"" Mr. Berube observed. In the more successful industrial counties, construction employment doubled, on average, from 1970 to 2016, as they absorbed new populations. The old industrial cities that developed around the Great Lakes in the first half of the 20th century have a different story. Population shrank on average. Construction employment did not grow. Only six of the 35 urban industrial counties scattered across the Northeast in 1970 held their own or gained employment compared with the national trend over the next 46 years. Of 63 urban industrial cities in the Midwest in 1970, only 30 managed the feat.

Macon County, Ill. -- home of Decatur, ""the pride of the prairie""-- was an agribusiness hub and steel town that also housed mammoth production facilities for the likes of Caterpillar and Firestone Tire and Rubber. But it lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs from 1970 to 2016. Total jobs grew by less than half a percent over 46 years. Understand Inflation and How It Affects You

But had job growth followed national patterns it would have grown at twice that pace. Median household incomes fell a whopping 14 percent. These older industrial cities that had helped build the American middle class were by 1970 riven by conflicts between management and labor, between cities and suburbs, and between blacks and whites. ""The tension from segregation in the Midwest and North was a bigger deal,"" Mr. Berube told me.

Mr. Banaian noted how St. Cloud was smart to develop industrial parks along the transportation arteries connecting it to the rest of the country. Raw money may help, too. Electrolux is decamping to South Carolina from St. Cloud thanks, in part, to a tax incentive worth $73 million over 32 years, according to a state estimate cited by the company. Research by Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, and Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago suggests that for all policymakers' gripes about government subsidies to corporate investment, they can yield a high return to the local economy. In the end, a lot comes down to luck. St. Cloud isn't just on the Mississippi. It is on Interstate 94, U.S. 10 and the BNSF Railway -- putting it within reach of many markets. What's more, it produces things like trailers, buses and snowmobile engines, which for some reason are not China's or Mexico's forte. Its service industries -- a growing part of its economic base -- thrive off the underserved rural towns in the western half of the state. Its medical center alone employs 10,000 people. If the successful industrial counties of the Midwest have a lesson for their less successful peers, it must be that they can't stop evolving. ""It is hard for communities to become something else,"" Mr. Berube said. That is precisely what declining industrial cities are being repeatedly called to do. And there is nothing to say that communities that successfully transformed themselves over the past 50 years will succeed again. Right now, St. Cloud's main problem may be a labor shortage. But already Mr. Banaian is worried about the internet. St. Cloud has a large retail and hospitality industry. People in the western part of the state will come into town to shop and eat and perhaps stay for the weekend. The internet, however, is putting many retailers out of business. ""That part is going away,"" Mr. Banaian said."

FRANKFURT -- The Group of 20 summit meeting in Cannes was supposed to be a chance for Europe and the event's host, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, to shine. Instead, the two-day meeting is coming at an extraordinarily dark time for the Continent, with Europe in political disarray, its economy tipping into recession and the future of the euro zone in doubt. If anyone can afford to strut on the beaches of the Cote d'Azur during the meeting on Thursday and Friday, it should be the fast-growing developing countries, especially China, but also India, Russia and Brazil. The balance of power has shifted so rapidly that Europe is now asking them for money, and they are in a stronger position to push their views on trade rules and other issues. But the leaders of the big emerging economic powers of the world are not likely to be crowing. Not only do they face vulnerabilities of their own, like worrisome levels of inflation in China, but they also do not want to see their best customers struggle economically, especially when another crucial outlet for their exports -- the United States -- is also suffering. ""China is going to be in a pretty good position,"" said Uri Dadush, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ""But don't interpret that to mean that China is happy with all this. China is part of the world economy.""

That was the sentiment that President Hu Jintao of China expressed in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro this week. ""China sincerely wishes to see stability in the euro zone and the euro,"" he said. Typically, Group of 20 summit meetings are an occasion for the host leader to appear statesmanlike and push pet issues. Mr. Sarkozy had originally intended the Cannes meeting to focus on his call for changes to the international monetary system, in a bid to reduce exchange rate fluctuations and give the euro and other currencies more status compared with the dollar. In character for the frenetic French president, the agenda also contains an ambitious list of other goals, including changing bank regulation, as well as dealing with unemployment, corruption, tax evasion, food security and global warming. Mr. Sarkozy's schedule even includes a meeting on Thursday morning with Bill Gates of Microsoft to discuss development financing. There will undoubtedly be pronouncements on many of these issues. Most of the work on such questions is done in advance by lower-level officials. The summit meeting, which begins with a working lunch Thursday, is to a large extent a photo opportunity at which leaders issue communiques that were agreed upon well ahead of time. But events this week have forced Mr. Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, to become mired in Greek politics when they would rather that their constituencies see them appearing on the global stage with President Obama or Mr. Hu.

Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel met in an emergency session Wednesday afternoon with the heads of European Union institutions and the International Monetary Fund to discuss the Greek situation. In the evening, they met with President George A. Papandreou of Greece, who had declared Monday that he would let his people decide in a referendum whether they supported his tough-minded, often painful efforts to keep Greece afloat. The proposal, which could lead to Greece's withdrawal from the euro zone, upset financial markets and undermined the latest European rescue plan. With the Greek government struggling to stay in power, it is not clear what answers Mr. Papandreou can offer before the referendum, even if he survives a confidence vote in Parliament scheduled for Friday night. He pledged to hold the referendum by Dec. 4 or 5. Officials said that until Greece's commitment to the plan to fix its budget overruns is clear again, the country is unlikely to receive an 8 billion euro ($11 billion) aid installment, due this month, which is needed before the end of the year to pay bills and salaries. A spokesman for the German finance ministry said Greece apparently has enough money to keep running until mid-December, when it has to redeem more than 6 billion euros in debt. Meanwhile, the relentless flow of negative economic news continued. A survey of managers in manufacturing, published Wednesday, pointed to a decline in European output during the last three months of 2011. The biggest drop in sentiment came in Italy, further heightening fears that a combination of slow growth and political paralysis could make it impossible for that country to continue to service its debt. While markets recovered some of the ground they lost earlier in the week, investors' unease was apparent when the European Financial Stability Facility pulled back from a planned 3 billion euro deal to issue 10-year bonds to help finance Ireland's bailout because of a lack of buyers. As part of the overall European effort to maintain stability in the euro zone, the facility is to be enlarged from 440 billion euros to 1 trillion euros and provide ""risk insurance"" to new bonds issued by struggling euro zone countries.

The last-minute cancellation of the small and normally routine operation is ""indicative that there is a huge amount of uncertainty out there which hasn't been helped by the Greek decision,"" said Nick Matthews, senior European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. ""A week ago we thought we had a grand plan."" Contributing to the spirit of turmoil, the Occupy Wall Street movement is expected to inspire a robust turnout for protests against the Group of 20 in nearby Nice. ""The timing is not good for the French president,"" said Gregory Chin, a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. The agenda ""raised too many expectations instead of delivering on the core issue of global growth,"" Mr. Chin said by telephone from Cannes. With the advanced industrial countries weakened, they will be in less of a position to pressure China on perennial issues like its undervalued currency or the need to increase domestic consumption and reduce its trade surplus. China will be in a better position to promote the issues it cares about, like a greater voice in the I.M.F. But China will face restraints in deploying its power. For one thing, to do so would mean accepting more global responsibility. ""They'll keep trying to free-ride as much as possible to focus on their internal challenges,"" said David Shorr, a policy analyst at the Stanley Foundation, an organization in Muscatine, Iowa, that promotes international cooperation. ""The U.S. will keep nudging them to shoulder more responsibilities as a rising power."" Despite its growth, China has serious internal problems, including credit and housing bubbles in some regions, overindebted local governments and rising wages that make it harder to compete with nations like Indonesia or Vietnam. ""They come across as cocky sometimes,"" said Mr. Dadush of the Carnegie Institute. ""But they are very aware they don't want to push their weight around. They have their own issues to deal with.""

There are few expectations for any serious breakthroughs. But investors in markets will be watching the sessions in Cannes closely anyway, putting leaders under pressure to offer a stronger response to the European debt crisis even though that issue is not formally on the agenda. German officials, who could not be quoted because of the delicacy of the matter, insisted they would not use the summit meeting to beg China or other countries like Russia and China to contribute to the European rescue fund. Klaus Regling, the chief executive of the stability fund, was in China and Japan this week trying to attract investors for the fund. Many analysts are skeptical that the G-20 leaders, who will be together hardly more than 24 hours, will be able to deliver anything but a bland assurance that Europe will do whatever it takes to contain the crisis. ""I think we will get a disappointing comment from them on this,"" said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ""They have said over and over that the governments of Europe will do whatever has to be done."""

He was treated and now organizes a colon cancer charity bike ride.



A prominent cancer organization is for the first time recommending Americans initiate colorectal cancer screening at age 45 instead of waiting until age 50, a threshold long endorsed by many other medical groups. The new guidelines, from the American Cancer Society, would extend routine colorectal cancer screening to an additional 22 million American adults between the ages of 45 and 49 and send a clear message that colorectal cancer, which has been rising in young adults, is no longer just a disease of older people. Dr. Thomas Weber, who is the co-chairman of an early-age onset colon cancer task group for the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable but who was not involved in writing the new recommendation, called lowering the age for first screening ""a game changer"" that could save thousands of lives. ""This is a very, very big deal,"" said Dr. Weber, who is director of surgical oncology for the northwest region of Northwell Health. ""Solid epidemiological data from our national cancer registries documents a dramatic increase in the incidence of colon and especially rectal cancer among individuals under the age of 50, and the vast majority of those cases are in the 40- to 49-year-old age bracket."" The guidelines, released Wednesday, were published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. They do not call for everyone to have a colonoscopy, the gold standard of colon cancer screening. Rather, to maximize the chances that people will take up screening, the cancer society wants physicians to offer patients a choice of six different screening options, from the most invasive procedure, colonoscopy, which can be done every 10 years, to lab tests done on stool samples that can be collected at home, which must be repeated more often and followed by colonoscopy if results are positive.

The group estimates some 16,450 new cases of colon or rectal cancers will be diagnosed this year in Americans under 50. Progress in the field. In recent years, advancements in research have changed the way cancer is treated. Here are some recent updates: Uterine cancer. Women who use chemical hair straighteners frequently could have a higher risk of developing uterine cancer than women who have never used the products, according to new findings from a national study that has followed nearly 34,000 U.S. women for more than a decade. Breast cancer. A new study suggests surgery may not always be necessary for all breast cancer patients. A small early-stage clinical trial found that a carefully selected group of patients who responded remarkably well to chemotherapy could skip surgery altogether. Cancer vaccines. For a long time, the promise of cancer vaccines that would protect healthy people at high risk of cancer has only dangled in front of researchers. Now, though, encouraging animal data and preliminary studies in human patients are making some doctors feel optimistic. Rectal cancer. A small trial that saw 18 rectal cancer patients taking the same drug, dostarlimab, appears to have produced an astonishing result: The cancer vanished in every single participant. Experts believe that this study is the first in history to have achieved such results. In 2014, 43 percent of colorectal cancer cases in those under 50 were in adults aged 45 to 49, according to Rebecca L. Siegel, an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society and the lead author of several reports showing a rise in colorectal cancers in adults as young as their 20s and 30s. The group does not recommend routine screening for those under 45 because the absolute rates of cancer in those age groups are still very low and there are risks associated with procedures like colonoscopies, including a perforated bowel. Over 140,000 Americans are expected to be given a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer this year. The disease leads to over 50,000 deaths annually, making it the second leading cause of cancer fatalities among American adults. The vast majority of colorectal cancers are still found in older people, with nearly 90 percent of all cases diagnosed in people over 50. But while incidence and deaths among those 55 and older have been declining in recent decades, at least in part because of screening that results in removal of precancerous polyps and early detection of cancer, recent analyses have documented a 50 percent rise in colorectal cancer rates among adults under 50 between 1994 and 2014.

While colorectal cancer rates dropped steadily for people born between 1890 and 1950, they have been increasing for every generation born since 1950. A recent American Cancer Society study by Dr. Siegel found that adults born in 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer compared to the risk adults born in 1950 faced at a comparable age. For younger adults like Gale Fritsche, now 55, of Allentown, Pa., existing recommendations fell short. Mr. Fritsche went in for his first screening colonoscopy at 50 but discovered he already had advanced colon cancer. ""I went in there not thinking there's going to be a problem, and I wake up with two doctors standing over me saying, 'We have an issue,'"" said Mr. Fritsche, a competitive athlete who said he follows a healthy diet and has no family history of colon cancer. ""If screening had started five years earlier, my cancer might have been caught at the really early stages and not been as advanced as it was."" The new guideline puts the American Cancer Society at odds with other national organizations that recommend starting screening at 50, and raises questions about whether health insurers will pay for the earlier tests. The influential Preventive Services Task Force decided against lowering the screening age to 45 when it updated its recommendations in 2016, and continues to recommend starting routine screening at 50. The Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, which includes representatives from several gastroenterology groups, urges African-Americans to start routine screening at 45 because they carry a higher burden of colorectal cancer but advises others at average risk to start screening at 50. The American Cancer Society acknowledges that the evidence for screening in those under 50 is not as robust as for those 50 and older, but say it is compelling nonetheless. The group also says that screenings should continue through age 75 but that decisions for those over 75 should be individualized based on patient preference, life expectancy and health status.

The message to both the general public and to physicians is that ""colorectal cancer can occur at any age,"" even among teenagers, said Dr. Richard C. Wender, chief cancer control officer for the American Cancer Society. ""If you're losing weight or have bowel changes or have symptoms like blood in your stool, you need an answer as to why."" He noted that though hemorrhoids are one cause of rectal bleeding, they are less common in younger people and ""there's no such thing as normal rectal bleeding."" ""What's really important is for physicians to be aware,"" said Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist who is co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal Cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which is dedicated solely to treating patients under 50. ""Many of our young patients say, 'Well I saw five doctors who said it was hemorrhoids and thought I was too young to have cancer.' One of our main goals is to get the word out to all the physicians who are seeing these people first."""

I think it's fair to say the job is taken."" What books are on your nightstand? There's a bunch, because I've always got books that I'm writing about in addition to books I'm reading for pleasure. For pleasure, I'm reading ""The Journals of Denton Welch,"" the strangely wonderful English novelist and artist who died tragically young in the 1940s. About 10 years ago I read his three autobiographical novels, which are just not like anything else: There's a gossamer delicacy of feeling that teeters on the edge on feyness, but it's never precious, because there's also a steeliness in the writing, a detachment in his willingness to confront real emotional strangeness. I only last month discovered the journals which, apart from very moving material about his life, offers tons of delicious tidbits, from entire scenes (a hilarious lunch with Edith Sitwell, who was his champion) to small moments when the writing itself stops you in your tracks. At one point he compares the sound of a harpsichord ""to a large and very beautiful cat unsheathing its claws, pawing the air, mouthing, miawlling."" For work, I've got a bunch of books about Virgil's ""The Aeneid,"" a new translation of which I'm writing about, and also the novels and stories of the contemporary German writer Jenny Erpenbeck, which I'm reading in preparation for a piece about her most recent novel, about a retired Berlin classics professor who becomes involved with African refugees. I've loved her previous work, but obviously this one is going to be of special interest to me. What influences your decisions about which books to read? Word of mouth, reviews, a trusted friend? Every now and then a review will make me want to pick something up, if it's by someone I trust; but for me, as for most people, it's word of mouth that gets me interested in something. I always listen to the recommendations of two close friends in particular: Bob Gottlieb, the former Knopf and The New Yorker editor, and the television writer and novelist Richard Kramer. Whenever they tell me to read something, I go right out and get it, and I've never regretted it, because they know me and my taste so well. They're like personal shoppers, but for books. Actually, now I'm thinking, ""Wow, what a great idea!""

What's the last great book you read? I'll talk about the last ""wonderful"" book I read, since I've gotten allergic to the word ""great"" lately -- everyone's best friend on Twitter is ""the great so-and-so"" who has just written a ""great"" book or article, blah blah. The word means nothing any more. The last wonderful book I read was Sebastian Barry's ""Days Without End"" -- a Gottlieb recommendation -- about a young Irish immigrant who gets mired in the traumas of 19th-century American history, not least the extermination of the Native Americans and the Civil War. There's something about the narrator's voice, a combination of utter ingenuousness and deep humane wisdom, that reminds you of ""Moby-Dick."" I'd say this is the great American novel of the decade, but the author happens to be Irish. Which classic novel did you recently read for the first time? Since I'm a nonfiction writer, and always trying to remind people that nonfiction is literature, too, I'll talk about a classic work of nonfiction, ok? I'd read large chunks of Edward Gibbon's ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" in graduate school, inevitably, but a few years ago a friend of mine told me he'd just finished listening to the whole thing on audiobook, and I thought, Yup, now's the time to tackle the whole thing. So I started listening to the marvelous recording by Bernard Mayes and I'm about to finish it after three years of shortish sessions on the elliptical machine. Apart from the history that Gibbon narrates -- one that should be of interest to Americans right now, I'd say -- I'm just knocked over by the prose: those fabulous, architectural, Augustan sentences are dazzling. Among other things, it's a lesson in how immaculate syntax is the best delivery vehicle for devastating irony. Which fiction and nonfiction writers -- playwrights, critics, journalists, poets -- inspired you most early in your career? And which writers working today do you most admire? During the 1970s, when I was a teenager, I avidly followed the critics who were then writing for The New Yorker. There was Andrew Porter on classical music and opera; Helen Vendler on poetry; Whitney Balliett on cabaret and jazz; Pauline Kael on movies; Penelope Gilliatt on books; Arlene Croce on ballet. I lived in the suburbs and had very little access to any of those art forms, but the sheer stylishness of their writing, the total (but lightly worn) authority married to utter accessibility, the confident idiosyncrasies, were very alluring to me purely as a reader, and suggested to me at that early stage that criticism was an interesting and important genre of writing in itself and not merely parasitic. The critics I admire today, unsurprisingly, have those qualities, whether it's Vinson Cunningham raising an eyebrow about ""Humans of New York"" or the painter David Salle writing about Rei Kawakubo in The New York Review of Books, or Francine Prose being unimpressed by some overhyped new novel. As for fiction, I fell early under the sway of the historical novelist Mary Renault, whose books set in ancient Greece were a major factor in pushing me toward the study of the classics.

What kinds of books bring you the most reading pleasure these days? Biographies, letters, journals -- the records of people's lives, and the traces they themselves leave behind. This may be a middle-aged thing: When you're (somewhat) closer to the end of life than to the beginning, it's hard to resist the impulse to start ""taking stock"" of yourself and what you've done, and so it's interesting to see how the lives of talented or celebrated or important people looked to those people while they were still living those lives. And of course, what the letters and journals show is that most of our lives are mostly a jumble while we're living them, because we're caught up in the day-to-day for the most part; it's for the biographers to perceive the contours, once it's all over. I find that reassuring. Which genres are you drawn to and which do you avoid? I was long immune to the allure of fantasy literature. Even when I was a kid, I couldn't get into ""The Lord of the Rings"" and all the rest of it. I'm not sure why, really. It may be that I got hooked on history and biography when I was still very young -- ancient Egypt, Greek and Roman history, Plantagenet history, Elizabeth I, Mary, Queen of Scots -- and I just couldn't imagine why anyone would need to invent a whole world or civilization when the ones we already have are so fascinating. But I may be evolving: I hugely enjoyed reading, and very much admired, all of the ""Game of Thrones"" books, which I tackled a few years ago for a piece I wrote about the TV series. Unsurprisingly, a genre I've always loved is historical fiction. There are a lot of terrible examples out there, but when it works -- when a deep sense of history (not just the props, but the spirit) is married to an authentic novelistic sensibility, as they are in the novels of Renault or Patrick O'Brian or Hilary Mantel, to name a few of the best -- it's tremendously satisfying. I find it amusing that this genre is still denigrated by some critics as being a lesser form of the novel. I always want to remind them that ""War and Peace"" and ""Les Miserables"" are historical fiction. What's your favorite book to teach to students at Bard? You're fishing! ""The Odyssey,"" of course, is one -- of the two Homeric epics it's the one that students tend to enjoy more. But I also love teaching Greek tragedy -- it's at once so formally strange, so stiffly stylized and yet (of course) so eternally relevant in its themes. One of my favorite teaching experiences was when I participated in Bard's Prison Initiative last autumn, teaching Sophocles and Euripides to the inmates at a maximum-security facility about an hour from campus. I was blown away by the men's responses to the texts we read -- by the way in which they brought what they knew about violence and shame and disgrace and guilt to dramas that are, of course, about those very things. As you can imagine, it was very different from what even the smartest 19-year-old undergraduates can bring to the seminar table. Do you have a favorite book about writing or about literary criticism? I have a favorite book of literary criticism, which is Edmund Wilson's ""Axel's Castle."" I think most of us who are professional critics are shadowed by the secret fear that time will prove us wrong -- the virtues of our enthusiasms will prove to be ephemeral, or the things we panned will turn out to be classics. What's so remarkable to me about Wilson's book, which he published in 1931 and which is contemporary with some of the authors he wrote about -- Proust, Joyce, Pound, Stein -- is that he got everything just right. And right away, too: Within 10 years of the publication of Proust's ""A la recherche du Temps Perdu"" he'd completely grasped everything about it that was important and revolutionary. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I've got piles of books about home decor and haute couture all around my house. I'm currently slavering over the catalog for the Dior exhibition at the Louvre. What's the best book you've ever received as a gift? ""A Titanic Hero,"" the biography of Thomas Andrews, the shipbuilder who designed the Titanic (and went down with it). I was a Titanic groupie when I was a kid -- I belonged to the Titanic Enthusiasts of America -- and one day when I was around 12 an old family friend who was visiting presented it to me. It's hardly a great work of biography but it's always been the first book I pack up whenever I've moved.

Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain? Elizabeth Bennet in ""Pride and Prejudice"": Has there even been a more appealing protagonist? She's every smart person's secret self: clever on the outside, not so clever on the inside, and shocked to learn that the brain can't rule the heart. And her relationship with her father is so, so great. It's always surprising to me that more male writers don't talk about Austen as crucial to their literary identities; she seems absolutely essential. My favorite villain has to be Vautrin in Balzac's ""The Human Comedy."" Like all truly great writers, Balzac reserves some of his deepest sympathy -- and his greatest artistry -- for his most depraved characters. You're organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? Easy: Voltaire, Jane Austen, Gore Vidal. I'm not sure it would be the most successful dinner party I've ever had, but I'd enjoy it. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? I have a Dantesque fantasy, in which he'd be forced to read ""The Art of the Deal"" over and over again, throughout eternity. Who would you want to write your life story? Well, I'm a memoirist. I think it's fair to say the job is taken. What do you plan to read next? I've just finished a three-month-long book tour, so pretty much anything that isn't my book would be a huge relief at this point ... No, seriously: I've got an idea for a book about Erich Auerbach, the great (really great!) German literary scholar who fled Hitler and ended up writing his (really!) great study of Western literature, ""Mimesis,"" in ... Istanbul, where he'd taken refuge. I ordered all his books, as well as a number of books about him, while I was on tour, and they've all arrived by now. There's no better feeling than that: knowing that a pile of books connected to some new project is waiting for you."
37567,"Cups of Tea, Pashminas and Momos, Seeing India's Himalayas on a Budget","In the Ladakh region of northern India, the town of Leh is known for its beauty and culture, and for the experience of buying a cashmere scarf.","Two monks in traditional garb greet the day by blowing dung dkar, ceremonial horns, at Thikse monastery in Ladakh.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/09/travel/09Hours1/18Frugal-Leh1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cef84277ce918a05b1cb3d512196dabd8b05b92b4f66e9687d0fac76b4f8cc7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/travel/budget-leh-india-.html,c73a8c20-df34-5727-b902-406b7fa9c851.jpg,"I told the owner, George Sher Ali, that I'd been in his shop before, several years before, and his ears perked up. ""Tell me what you bought,"" he said, and reached for a tall stack of old assignment notebooks. ""I will tell you exactly when you came in."" I said I'd been into his art and print shop, L'Araba Fenice, roughly eight years ago on a trip to Leh, a town in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, in the far north of India. I bought two or three postcards, as had a friend who had come with me. He flipped through the pages of a few dog-eared notebooks for several minutes before announcing decisively, ""This is you. Five postcards."" And he pointed at a hand-scrawled entry in a ledger dated Sept. 19, 2010. It was eight years ago to the day that I'd visited his store. Leh (pronounced LAY), once the royal seat of a former Buddhist kingdom, is a place with a seemingly undying memory, ageless and eternal as the mountains that surround it. The Ladakh region, dotted with poplars and dominated by the Himalayas, has changed noticeably over the last decade, welcoming more tourists, restaurants and guesthouses. But it remains a wondrous destination for the adventurous traveler, full of captivating scenery, generous and friendly people, and accessible monasteries and holy places nearby. And it doesn't hurt that it can all be done fairly inexpensively. A couple of planning tips: You'll probably want to arrive by plane. The flight to Leh's Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport from New Delhi is about an hour, compared to a 25-hour drive. Flights, fortunately, can be cheap. I bought a one-way ticket directly through Air India for about 2,800 Indian rupees, or less than $40. Because of the unpredictable mountain climate at such high altitude (Leh is at around 11,500 feet), flights arrive and depart in the morning. Don't plan to hop an evening flight.

Despite the territorial jockeying between China, Pakistan and India over the disputed Kashmir region, you won't need any kind of special visa or permit to visit Leh, or sites on the Srinagar-Leh Highway that runs west from town -- your Indian visa will do. But if you want to go to certain areas like the Nubra Valley, north of Leh, you'll need a special Inner Line Permit. The price depends on the length of the permit, but will run in the neighborhood of 400 to 500 rupees. Friends I'd met during my previous trip to Leh -- Tundup, a native of the area, and Sina, a Swiss national who visits frequently -- picked me up at the airport and dropped me at my lodgings, the Hotel Spic-n-Span on Old Leh Road (double rooms cost around $45 to $60 per night online). There are hundreds of hotels and guesthouses in Leh, at every price point, but I'd recommend staying within walking distance of the Main Bazaar, the hub of shopping and dining activity in town. The bazaar is a good destination for your first day in Leh -- you'll want to take it easy and drink plenty of water as your body acclimates to the noticeable change in altitude. The bazaar, once open to cars, but now a pedestrian walkway, is bedecked with banners from the local mosque and colorful Buddhist prayer flags. Street dogs trot lazily between vendors peddling local apricots (200 grams, almost half a pound, will run about 100 rupees), while hawkers call from their storefronts, promising the best prices for pashmina shawls and handmade crafts. In the distance, the nine-story Leh Palace surveys the activity below.

Through the entrance to the compact Tibetan Refugee Market, you'll find the Central Asian Museum (50 rupees entrance fee), a small but worthwhile cataloging of the history and customs of the area. No trip to Leh would be complete without buying a scarf of some kind (it'll help with the chilly temperatures and dust, too), and the purchasing is part of the experience. You do not simply walk into a store and buy a scarf -- it's a relationship. Majid, the storekeeper at Pashmina House on the north end of the bazaar (the Google Maps location is not quite correct -- the shop is further north), sat me down with a cup of tea and told me, at some length, details about the origins of pashmina, or cashmere woven from the fur of Pashmina goats. At least half an hour passed before the subject of price was even broached and even then it was done almost distastefully, with numbers being punched into a calculator and passed back and forth between us.

""And let me tell you, my friend,"" he said. ""The machine-made pashminas are 10 percent nylon. No one else will tell you this. But it is the truth."" The handmade pashminas ran in excess of 8,000 rupees, more than $100, as opposed to half that for the machine-woven scarves. I bought a machine-woven pashmina for myself (I honestly thought both were great; they both felt like spun cumulus clouds.) and a couple of beautifully patterned, very soft Merino wool scarves for 2,500 rupees apiece. A couple of bartering tips: While it's not the American way, try your best to get into it. Think of it as a dance or courting process, not as adversarial. Don't jump right in with numbers. Chat, have some tea and relax. If you don't like the price, act as if your heart has been broken, and walk away. Haggle hard, but if you know you're going to buy something, let the vendor feel like they've won -- they likely need the extra $5 or $10 more than you do. Exploring a new place where the air is so thin will frequently leave you gasping for breath. Take a breather, and refill your water bottle at Dzomsa, a small, environmentally conscious shop that sells sterilized water refills (bring your own bottle) for just 7 rupees, as well as some local artisanal products. I bought a jar of sweet apricot jam for 130 rupees. The cheerful shopkeeper, a woman named Stanzin, also offers same-day laundry service, for 95 rupees per kilo of clothing. If you need a bit more of a boost than water can provide, there are a number of good coffee places in town, another change from my last visit. Brazil Cafe, with a friendly staff and great rooftop deck, was a handy stop for Wi-Fi (coverage is not great in Leh, and you'll learn to take it where you can find it) and a 150-rupee cappuccino, as well as a surprisingly good 100-rupee banana bread. The Yum Yum Cafe, located in courtyard off the main market, also has good coffee (80 rupees) and crunchy peanut cookies (50 rupees apiece).

For a more modern take on local fare, try Namza, which is both a cafe and an upscale clothing store, owned by the designer Padma Yangchan. The clothes were a bit out of my league, price-wise, but the food was on point. A vegetarian o-chu tagi, soup with crimped, ear-shaped pasta, was very enjoyable (300 rupees). The restaurant Bon Appetit, off Changspa Road, takes some work to find after the sun goes down -- when you see fellow diners approaching on a dark path with cellphone flashlights, you know you've found the right place. The gorgeously designed space has no rival in town, and the food is excellent. A big mutton burger with fries cost 300 rupees, and a bottle of pleasingly sour sea buckthorn juice to wash it down with was 100. Venturing out of town is a good part of the fun of being in Leh, though, and I took advantage of the fact that my friend Sina had access to a car to explore the surrounding area. (For others, hiring a car and driver is easy, and encouraged, in Ladakh. The Ladakh Taxi Operator site can give you a good sense of what you can expect to pay for different trips. As always, bargain.) We made our way early one morning, sun at our backs, to explore a few different holy sites in the area. After a brief stop for photos at the confluence of the Indus and Zanskar Rivers, we arrived at the Likir Monastery. Originally built in 1065 by the fifth king of Ladakh and reconstructed in the 18th century following a fire, the gompa (monastery) sits atop a hill, with snow-streaked mountains framing it picturesquely in the background. Admission is 30 rupees. If you have the time, continue west for the next hour or two, winding along the Indus River through the pristine and rugged mountainscape. In 70 kilometers , or about 43 miles, you'll reach Lamayuru Monastery, one of the most venerated and ancient monasteries in the region (50 rupees admission). A legend states that Arahat Madhyantika, who brought Buddhism to the region, visited the site and prophesied that teachings of the religion would flourish. The structure, which emits a certain serenity and calm, is situated in an area known as Moon Land, where the normally harsh lines of the mountainsides come together and fall in soft waves. Lamayuru is a trek from Leh; If you want to visit somewhere a bit closer, Thikse Monastery is less than 20 kilometers west of town. Thikse, whose different white buildings cascade regally down a hillside, bears a resemblance to the Potala Palace in Tibet. We visited early, as the sun was rising, to catch morning prayers. Two young monks dressed in robes and orange headpieces stepped onto the roof and blew into their dung dkar, or conch shell horns. The ritual stunned us for its simplicity and beauty.

Titled ""A Planetary Garden: Cultivating Coexistence,"" the exhibition, which opened June 16, takes migration as one of its themes. And days before the international art crowd descended on the Sicilian capital, Italy's new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, closed the country's ports to rescue boats -- including the Aquarius, a ship looking to dock in Italy with 629 migrants aboard. Palermo's mayor, Leoluca Orlando, wants to transform the city through culture. Gianni Cipriano for The New York Times Resisting the national announcement, Palermo's mayor, Leoluca Orlando, offered to open the local port to the vessel, but the Italian Coast Guard declined to escort it in and the migrants were rerouted to Spain. Mr. Orlando, who often personally greeted migrants who arrived in Palermo's harbor before Mr. Salvini's decision, is famous for fighting the Sicilian mafia in multiple terms as mayor since the 1980s.

Another mission is to transform his hometown with culture: He bid successfully for Palermo to be recognized as Italy's ""Capital of Culture"" this year, bringing extra government funding for cultural activities and tourism, and he was instrumental in bringing Manifesta, a roving arts festival, to the city. This year, Manifesta is using Palermo as a stage on which to consider some of our time's most pressing dilemmas. ""It's a migrant biennial. And Palermo is a migrant city,"" said Mr. Orlando. Sicily has long been at the crossroads of Africa and Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. Phoenicians, Arabs, Greeks and Normans left their often glorious cultural and architectural marks on Palermo long before World War II and a period of mafia-driven real estate speculation and neglect left ugly scars. Muslims, Christians and Jews lived on the island in harmony for hundreds of years. Even the plants are mostly imports -- the Sicilian lemon originated in the Middle East. The flow of humans is one of Manifesta's primary themes. Another is human interaction with nature: The exhibition's title comes from a 1997 essay by the French landscape architect Gilles Clement that presents the notion of human beings as Earth's gardeners. ""You can see the world's crises through the lens of Palermo, in a condensed way,"" said Hedwig Fijen, founder and director of Manifesta. ""The exhibition asks, 'With all the issues we're dealing with today, how is the human being still in charge of the garden?'""

As the exhibition ""mediators"" (this Manifesta avoids the word curator), Bregtje van der Haak, Andres Jaque, Ippolito Pestellini Laparelli and Mirjam Varadinis have planted interdisciplinary works by more than 50 artists, architects and thinkers across 20 venues, ranging from long-neglected palaces to Palermo's lush botanical garden. In the Moorish halls of the seaside Palazzo Forcella de Seta, ""Untitled (Near Parndorf, Austria)"" by the Irish artist John Gerrardis uses video game technology to reconstruct the site where, in August 2015, an abandoned truck was discovered on an Austrian highway, filled with the suffocated bodies of 71 migrants.

Several artists address the issue of surveillance. Among them is ""Connected by Air,"" by the Amsterdam-based designer Richard Vijgen, which is projected on a ceiling in the Palazzo Ajutamicristo. Reminiscent of a planetarium display, it traces not constellations but real-time data from aircraft, wireless signals and satellites in the sky above Palermo, reminding us that we're never not being watched.

To create ""Signal Flow,"" the American filmmaker Laura Poitras collaborated with the Danish journalist Henrik Moltke and film students in Palermo. ""We learned how essential Sicily is for the U.S. military, both in terms of communications and the drone program,"" said Ms. Poitras, explaining that signals from drone operators based in the United States are relayed to their targets through satellite dishes recently installed on Sicily and vehemently protested by local activists; an older United States Navy base has been present on the island since 1959. The installation's centerpiece is a meditative short film of a relay site and its surroundings. It was surreptitiously filmed with a drone, turning drone surveillance back on itself. Such documentary pieces are stark reminders of our darker realities, yet this Manifesta also celebrates beauty, hope and possibility. In the Palermo Botanical Garden, established in 1789 and home to 12,000 species, art works emerge from the foliage. The Colombian artist Alberto Baraya collected Palermo's decorative artificial plants and arranged them taxonomically amid real ones in the garden's greenhouse. And on a screen in a grove of bamboo stalks, the video ""Pteridophilia"" by the Chinese artist Zheng Bo follows seven young Taiwanese men who engage in intimate contact with ferns: ""plant porn,"" perhaps, but weirdly compelling. Many site-specific community projects, including a garden planted with residents of a social housing project on the city's outskirts, are the result of extensive research conducted as the exhibition took shape. The Dutch architecture firm OMA led a deep study of the city through data analysis and interviews with residents, culminating in a book called ""Palermo Atlas."" ""Manifesta can be a mirror of a possible Palermo, a mirror of the future,"" Mr. Orlando said. ""It's not a temporary event.""

""Art can instigate small changes, when it starts with respect and moderation,"" said Marinella Senatore, an Italian artist who assembles public performances based on gestures of protest. (Her drawings and banners, made in collaboration with locals, are on view until Manifesta ends in November). On Manifesta's opening weekend, her ""Palermo Procession"" saw 300 participants including children, dancers, majorettes, and marginalized groups like prostitutes and mentally ill people, gathering at City Hall. They marched, sang, and danced behind blind residents of the city that Ms. Senatore chose as parade leaders, snaking through the historical center for four hours, picking up hundreds of Manifesta visitors, tourists and rogue performers along the way. It was joyous and loud and empowering. ""At the moment, the biggest issue, politically, is to learn how to stay together,"" Ms. Senatore said. ""The participants say we changed the city that night."" The performance and the exhibition as a whole honor Palermo's multilayered history, its problems and its potential. But they also remind us that coexistence can be celebrated, and needn't be feared."

Trump breaking in to call Hillary Clinton ""a nasty woman"" in one of the most-derided lines of the night). But perhaps we should have seen it coming. Not just because of his past behavior, but because it was signaled by those in the Republican candidate's corner.

Which is to say: his family.

Melania, Ivanka and Vanessa Trump -- the candidate's wife, daughter and daughter-in-law -- all wore black to the final debate, a departure from the colors they chose for earlier appearances, which tended to the light and bright. (Melania Trump did wear black to the first debate, but it was an off-the-shoulder dress, so there was a lot of skin.)

Given that candidates' family members do not speak at debates, but are often featured in cutaway shots and the final exit, it is what they wear that speaks for them."

48651,DreamWorks Deal Would Serve Comcast's Entertainment Strategy,"An expected acquisition would allow Comcast to build on its successful NBCUniversal entertainment business, which includes TV, film and theme parks.",Comcast is now in talks to acquire DreamWorks Animation. The acquisition would fit squarely into Comcast's entertainment strategy.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/28/business/28COMCAST/28COMCAST-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=47ffe5afe68c11113ba1647625e91a59ef837d22f67df8d80c1c2118f6e04ff9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/business/media/dreamworks-deal-would-serve-comcasts-entertainment-strategy.html,aaedd38b-9523-5c75-bda1-556096aecaa1.jpg,"The media giant had suffered an embarrassing blow when its $45 billion takeover of its rival Time Warner Cable collapsed under regulatory scrutiny. Since then, the company has been relatively quiet. As the rest of the media business was engulfed in turmoil over the fate of television in a digital world, Comcast continued to deliver strong, consistent results across its cable, television and film businesses. Some analysts said they expected Comcast to shift gears and pursue a new megadeal to expand its global footprint or enter the wireless business. But no significant deal materialized. News emerged late Tuesday that Comcast was in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation, the boutique studio run by Jeffrey Katzenberg. The potential deal, which still could fall apart, values DreamWorks Animation at about $3 billion, according to people with knowledge of the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them. If completed, the deal would underscore the constant balancing act required of Comcast. On one side is its cable and broadband business, which controls the pipes that deliver content to people's homes, and which faces increased regulatory scrutiny. On the other is the NBCUniversal entertainment business, which spans broadcast and cable television, film and theme parks.

The acquisition of DreamWorks Animation would fit squarely into the entertainment strategy, allowing Comcast to build on an already successful part of the company. ""It has been very clear that they can't do many deals within cable, so their focus is on organic growth and operational excellence,"" said Amy Yong, an analyst with the Macquarie Group. She noted that the company had made a series of deals on the entertainment side, acquiring a majority ownership stake of the Universal Studios Japan theme park and investments in the digital outlets Vox and BuzzFeed. ""DreamWorks would be big in the context of the studio business, Ms. Yong said. During a conference call Wednesday morning, Comcast executives declined to comment on the speculated deal activity. In response to a question about the relative values of the distribution and content businesses, Brian L. Roberts, the chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said that the company was stronger because of its position in both. ""These things go up and down, and the relationship between the two in terms of carriage disputes and other things,"" he said. ""At any one time, one part of the ecosystem could be doing better than the other part of the ecosystem. But in the end, we're bringing great experiences to consumers in either content, in innovative distribution technologies, and that's how we're running our company.""

He spoke as Comcast reported first-quarter results, once again beating expectations, with net income up 3.6 percent to $2.1 billion. Total revenues increased 5.3 percent to $18.8 billion, fueled by growth in the cable and entertainment businesses. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What's their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. Comcast's cable business reported revenue growth of 6.7 percent for the quarter, adding 53,000 video customers and 438,000 high-speed-Internet customers. Revenues increased 3.9 percent in the NBCUniversal group, driven by an uptick in revenues in its cable television and theme park businesses. In some ways, DreamWorks Animation is a why-not acquisition for Comcast. The price would be small. To put it in perspective, a deal for DreamWorks Animation would be about one-fifteenth the size of Comcast's failed bid for Time Warner Cable and about a tenth the size of its $30 billion acquisition of the entertainment group NBCUniversal, which closed five years ago. Also, very few content companies, particularly in family entertainment, are available to purchase. DreamWorks Animation would give Comcast's entertainment business an immediate lift, with its established animation studio and a growing television business. It also has a grasp on the elusive millennial market with its part ownership of AwesomenessTV, the producer and distributor of programming aimed primarily at teenage girls. At the same time, it would give Comcast a gateway to international growth. DreamWorks Animation has aggressively courted Chinese regulators and audiences, building an animation studio in Shanghai called Oriental DreamWorks. DreamWorks Animation is perhaps most valuable to Comcast as a way to compete with the Walt Disney Company in the theme park business. Since buying NBCUniversal, Comcast has poured billions into its Universal resorts."

That influential set included Francois Morellet, whose strong retrospective continues at Dia:Chelsea through June 2; Julio Le Parc, who exhibited at the Perez Art Museum Miami in 2016; and the Hungarian-born Vera Molnar, now 94. This second exhibition of her work at Senior & Shopmaker reintroduces New Yorkers to her historically significant geometric abstraction, above all her pioneering efforts with early computers.

Early works on paper here -- such as a pair of collages from 1961 that feature notched rectangles of pure red -- disclose the influence of Russian Suprematism on Ms. Molnar's nonobjective art. By 1968, having learned to program in the computer languages Fortran and Basic, she was writing scripts that could create a grid with random vertical, horizontal and variously angled diagonal lines, as well as blank spaces. She outputted these thickets of oscillating, stuttering strokes to a plotter, whose pen could move only along X and Y axes; look closely and you can see the janky diagonals. Ms. Molnar thought of these as drawings, not prints, and therefore only a single edition exists of each computer work.

Later, she used the computer to draw airier compositions with diagonals; wobbly, concentric squares; and arrays of black bands that gently rise and fall. Even when not working with technology, Ms. Molnar approached her art algorithmically: In a large 1971 drawing, she has executed by hand the same random distribution of angled strokes that the computer could produce unthinkingly. The density of Ms. Molnar's drawings, whether executed by pen or plotter, embodies a pleasure in repetition and exactitude that feels closer to the humanistic minimalism of Agnes Martin and Nasreen Mohamedi than to Paris's groovy-for-groovy's-sake Op and Kinetic art. They are also a salutary reminder of the central role that women have long played in computer programming, from Ada Lovelace to today's post-internet experimenters.

What's great about George Herriman's much admired early-20th-century comic strip ""Krazy Kat"" is its nearly unlimited scope for self-awareness. A stripped-down but playfully catholic style -- combined with a sturdy, repetitive narrative frame -- meant that Herriman could wink at the reader as often as he wanted, without losing his footing or boxing himself in. In the strip that the German painter Marcus Weber meticulously reproduces in ""Kwee Mokks"" (2018), Ignatz Mouse explains to Krazy that the ""kwee mokks all ova"" (queer marks all over) an old newspaper are writing, and then the two get into trouble with the paper's severely out-of-date weather forecast. It is one of the sharpest of the 16 excellent canvases that make up this exhibition at Thomas Erben Gallery, Mr. Weber's first American solo show. Held in the hands of a giant blue stick figure with a white head, the strip becomes an extraordinarily mordant comment on the state of painting. But in five small, colorful portraits of pedestrians on the Berlin street where Mr. Weber keeps his studio, his version of Herriman's strategic inconsistency becomes a surprisingly effective way of mimicking the irreducibility of real life. In ""A-Str. 13"" (2009), the flat orange stripes on a building wall, the green impasto of a woman's head scarf and the dark, cartoony line of her profile are all different types of painting; their clash is the perfect visual equivalent of street noise. In canvases like ""V-Park"" (2011), which depicts two cyclists on a rainbow bridge and a masked woman presiding over a gridlike-barbecue behind candy-colored chickadees, stylistic chaos becomes a joyful end in itself.

The premise of so-called identity art is that it makes you feel good about embracing your repressed, oppressed or marginal condition. Cary Leibowitz tweaks this approach in ""I need to grow up and be taken seriously said the clown at the urinal,"" his new exhibition at Invisible-Exports, in which he celebrates feeling good about feeling bad about himself. The text on one painting, ""Ugh he's crying again,"" pretty much sums up Mr. Leibowitz's ethos. Bad taste is his primary medium. The presentation starts at the edges of the gallery with a classic red-and-white gingham pattern covering the floor. Tables at the center are crammed with mass-produced ceramic tchotchkes -- garden gnomes, unicorns, vessels with chubby human feet -- printed with half-literate scrawling, such as, ""ok ur gay but what have you done lately."" One vase says, ""half empty."" Another reads, ""11th place [expletive] loser award."" (Mr. Leibowitz is a very uppercase-optional artist.) Photographs of men in military uniforms or at macho male gatherings bear captions like ""Golden Girls Fan Club"" or ""The Bette Davis Eyes Longjohns Weekend,"" turning normative male gatherings into something salaciously camp. Throughout the show, Mr. Leibowitz plays sleight of hand with art, history and identity, suggesting that you use whatever materials are at hand, from self-deprecation to cheap ceramics. He describes himself as a ""loser"" -- and yet he's a gallery-represented artist with a second career in managing art auction houses. In this context, marginality and power are complicated. In true borscht belt fashion, Mr. Leibowitz wickedly turns the tables, advising that when current politics and the odds are stacked against you, you should make fun of the whole thing.

Beryl Korot had a breakthrough in the 1970s. While working in print, video and weaving, she realized that all these mediums encode information in lines. This inspired an interest in ""how lines could be built up to create information,"" she said in a video for Art 21. In 1980, she started weaving her own canvases and devising a coded language based on their structure. It uses squares on a grid to symbolize the letters of the English alphabet. A key to it opens her new exhibition, ""A Coded Language,"" at the gallery Bitforms The key is legible but not readily comprehensible. It intimates that language can have meaning even when it's not understood. On her first hand-woven canvases, ""Babel 1"" and ""Babel 2"" (both 1980), Ms. Korot has painted the biblical story of the Tower of Babel in her code. The thin red-and-black characters of ""Babel 1"" look as if they belong to a non-Western language, while the symbols in ""Babel 2"" are more rectangular and blocky, like Morse code. Both are in rows contained in columns (or towers), suggesting a form that connects all written communication, despite the dispersion that concludes the Babel story."
11302,When America's Cold War Strategy Turned Corrupt,"Scott Anderson's ""The Quiet Americans"" describes how good intentions in foreign policy could lead to dire results.",Edward Lansdale,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/books/review/01Peraino/01Peraino-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=244024aca241482786d32e5caa5de95e04c6c367da98794a9909e5991a16c09d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/books/review/the-quiet-americans-scott-anderson.html,fad75645-0bb7-50d2-9990-bcba9b843055.jpg,"THE QUIET AMERICANS

Four CIA Spies at the Dawn of the Cold War -- a Tragedy in Three Acts

By Scott Anderson Once upon a time, there was a nation that saw itself as a beacon to the world. It would lead, as John Quincy Adams put it, by the gentle power of its example. If it all sounds a bit grandiose to us now, it did, too, to Graham Greene, the English author of the 1955 spy novel ""The Quiet American."" Greene liked to complain that Yankees were ""plump, smug, sentimental, ready for the easy tear and the hearty laugh and the fraternity yell."" He was particularly galled by American pretensions to purity in foreign affairs. ""Innocence,"" he insisted, ""is a kind of insanity."" Scott Anderson's enthralling new history of early Cold War espionage takes its title from Greene's classic -- and shares much of its disillusionment. Anderson, a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine and author of several books, including ""Lawrence in Arabia,"" follows the story of four C.I.A. operatives -- Michael Burke, , Peter Sichel and Frank Wisner -- from their heady early exploits through their government's ultimate betrayal of its own idealism. Anderson, whose own father once helped create foreign paramilitary squads as an adviser to the Agency for International Development, casts his characters' narrative as a tragedy, both personal and national. After a decade of flawed postwar spy games, by the mid-1950s much of the world had come to see the United States as just ""one more empire,"" Anderson writes, ""one that lied and stole and invaded"" like the others. Lying and stealing and invading, it should be said, make for captivating reading, especially in the hands of a storyteller as skilled as Anderson. All the characters of ""The Quiet Americans"" could have stepped from a film set -- and some of them actually had. Burke, a James Bond figure ""before James Bond existed,"" had been working as a screenwriter before being recruited by the C.I.A. He could just as often be found hanging out with Ava Gardner or sharing bourbon and pancakes with Ernest Hemingway as he could be dispatching infiltrators to Eastern Europe.

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of the month. See the full list. ] Indeed, for all their ill-advised or bungled covert ops -- which included coups from Tehran to Guatemala City -- it is impossible not to be a little swept up in the spectacle of this bygone era when intrepid individuals actually shaped history, even if it was often for the worse. Anderson quotes an erstwhile ornithologist who had joined the Office of Strategic Services, the C.I.A.'s World War II precursor, lamenting the office's breakup once the conflict had ended. ""Jesus H. Christ,"" the operative griped, ""I suppose this means that it's back to those goddamned birds."" Some of the people in this book will be familiar to students of C.I.A. and Cold War history. The story of Wisner, the head of the early intelligence apparatus's covert action arm, has been well told many times before. Anderson is at his best, however, when he plows fresh ground -- as he does with the story of Sichel, a German emigre who signed on to help the O.S.S. as a ""special funds officer,"" trading gold coins on the black market and artificially aging fresh bank notes by stomping on them. Sichel eventually rose to the position of head of C.I.A. operations in Eastern Europe, running agents deep inside Soviet territory. The problem, Sichel discovered, is that once these infiltrators arrived, they had almost no support system to latch onto. Often the local resistance networks were ephemeral, mere ""catchment basins"" for K.G.B. counterintelligence. Sichel came to view these operations as useless at best and immoral at worst. Anderson interviewed Sichel, who is now in his late 90s, eight times, and his story sensitively and dramatically illuminates the practical and moral dilemmas of mid-20th-century spycraft. Anderson's book is a period piece, covering the years 1944 to 1956 -- but the climate of fear and intolerance that it describes in Washington also feels uncomfortably timely. Even as the fledgling C.I.A. was swiftly expanding its reach in Europe and Asia, domestic enemies were beginning to chip away at its political support at home. Seeing an opportunity to hobble a bureaucratic rival, the F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover launched his own covert war against the C.I.A., spreading rumors that Wisner had compromised himself by a relationship with a Romanian princess and relentlessly hounding gay intelligence officers out of the service, a purge that came to be known as the Lavender Scare. Both these factors -- creeping right-wing hysteria at home and cynical maneuvering abroad -- combined to embitter Wisner's operators. ""For a man like Burke -- erudite, cultured, liberal, but also engaged in a war where ideas themselves were weapons -- it was all enough to call into question just what sort of nation and society he was fighting to defend,"" Anderson writes. Burke ultimately quit the agency in frustration in 1955 and took a job as general manager of the Ringling Brothers circus. (""You've been training for it all your life,"" his new boss needled him. ""You just haven't known it."")

Anderson lays most of the blame for the misadventures he recounts at the feet of the spies' political masters. The unacknowledged godfather of midcentury covert ops was George Kennan, President Truman's director of policy planning. In recent years Kennan's reputation has enjoyed something of a renaissance with the publication of his diaries and a major biography by John Lewis Gaddis that won the Pulitzer Prize. Yet Anderson refuses to see Kennan merely as a farsighted pragmatist. Kennan, he writes, for all his strengths, was also a craven dissembler, a ""two-faced weasel"" who disavowed his own responsibility for the collateral costs of containment once it became unfashionable. Anderson is equally hard on another celebrated pragmatist, Dwight Eisenhower, whose New Look doctrine helped solidify the role of covert operations in postwar foreign policy. Anderson derides Ike as ""an intensely ambitious creature, one willing to compromise on the most basic precepts of personal honor if it might play to his political advantage."" He faults New Look -- which combined the threat of massive nuclear retaliation with under-the-radar spy games -- for accelerating the arms race, dooming Europe to political stasis and turning the third world into a battleground for superpower proxy wars. Still, Anderson's critique raises the question: If not Eisenhower's particular brand of containment, then what? Most of the time the book leaves this unanswered. Anderson quotes the can-do Lansdale on the imperative of some type of action: ""You have to be for something."" Yet even the mildest activities -- raising the hopes of insurrectionists during the Hungarian revolution, for instance -- got Ike's spies in trouble. Sichel warns that it frequently would have been better to do nothing, to ""wait and let problems solve themselves."" This may be true -- a kind of Cold War version of President Obama's ""don't do stupid stuff"" doctrine -- but it is an answer unlikely to satisfy policymakers under political pressure to solve crises. Anderson, however, is not a policymaker; he is a journalist and historian. In foreign affairs, furthermore, endings often tend toward the messy and unhappy -- a condition, as Greene understood, that no wishful thinking or assertions of innocence are likely to alter. Greene liked to quote Chekhov's aphorism that a writer is ""not a confectioner, not a cosmetician, not an entertainer."" Anderson's narrative is certainly entertaining, but he is no confectioner, and the dark, poignant tale he tells is far the better for it."
876,Zanzibar in the Rain,"A soggy week on the Tanzanian archipelago leads to a mysterious curio shop, a taste of Zanzibar pizza, conversations with locals and a bit of spice lore.","On the waterfront at Forodhani Gardens in Stone Town, Zanzibar.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/22/travel/22Zanzibar1/merlin_167088954_379bbc77-bd33-4945-a365-a4dbdcb11806-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=388c4182e7624eb04be6e6f2deb22a2be18dbb78aafdd51f2728e08b3870c413&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/travel/zanzibar-tanzania-food-culture.html,11064f47-a616-52d1-9ce5-9d863d66bcae.jpg,"If my circumstances had not been so dire -- or rather, if my circumstances had been drier -- I might never have found myself at the Zanzibar Curio Shop. At first glance, the store did little to distinguish itself from other trinket purveyors besieging the tangled lanes of Stone Town, the historic quarter on the coast of Unguja, Zanzibar's main island: ""Hakuna Matata"" T-shirts obscured the facade and tourists browsed souvenirs. In any other city, I'd breeze past. But sodden from the fury of a downpour, feigning interest in refrigerator magnets seemed a small price to pay for shelter. ""If you want to see the real history of Zanzibar, you have to come upstairs,"" said Murtaza Akberali, who, with his brother, runs the store their father opened in 1968. And so I followed him through a portal to Zanzibar of yore: Hand-carved wood-and-brass trunks teetered against one wall; vintage cigarette ads from India and political posters from Tanzania formed a retro pastiche on another. The ceiling was an inverted necropolis of timeworn lanterns and teapots suspended from the rafters. Cameras and African tribal busts were jumbled in some nooks; others were orderly archives of domestic ephemera: a wall of grandfather clocks; a cluster of rusting keys, likely belonging to earlier iterations of the brass-studded doors I'd been compulsively Instagramming all over Stone Town. I flipped through bundles of black-and-white Indian matrimonial headshots, the subjects' bouffants, curlicues of eyeliner and flared pants suggesting a 1960s provenance. In one room, I paused before a glass cabinet of daggers glinting with bejeweled and mother-of-pearl hilts.

To prevent such exaltations from finding their way into my own notebook, Zanzibar made sure I encountered nothing of the sort. I'd landed on the first day of a delayed rainy season. While I'd been ready for showers, nothing, short of packing an ark, could have prepared me for the apocalyptic tempest that descended with my flight. Swimming in sapphire seas might have been out of the question, but I hadn't considered swimming down streets that had been transformed into gushing canals. These were not silvery, romantic mists slinking through latticed rooftops; this was a miasma of damp and despair.

Undeterred, I brandished my umbrella like a shield and waded through the waterlogged streets of Stone Town. While I certainly wouldn't have minded them, beaches and sunshine weren't what had lured me, anyhow. As someone who's lived in the Middle East, India and Africa, I've long been curious about the confluence of the three cultures on an archipelago that could, on a map, be mistaken for ink splotches in the Indian Ocean, just off the coast of Tanzania. The Swahili language spoken here is a composite of Bantu and Arabic, with tributes to Persian, Portuguese, English and Hindi. The architectural dialect is also complex: a dulcet dialogue between African, Arab, Indian and European influences. The briny air gnawing patterns into walls, the serpentine lanes shaded by filigreed balconies, and the ornately carved teak doors: All lend Stone Town a dreamlike beauty that even sheets of rain can't obscure. The culturally layered cuisine I would sample, and the mishmash of trinkets I browsed at Zanzibar Curio Shop, scavenged from estate sales, told me more about Zanzibar than a sun-drenched beach ever could.

""Zanzibar is not just one thing -- Arab, Indian, Persian or Bantu. It's what they call Swahili,"" the fashion designer Farouque Abdela said. With his dark glasses, embroidered kofia hat and a playful smirk tugging at his lips as he doles out sharp one-liners, Mr. Abdela is hard to miss. But if you want to be certain to catch him, your best bet is dropping by the Emerson Hurumzi hotel, an elegant 19th-century mansion once owned by a wealthy adviser to a sultan. Mr. Abdela designed the hotel's jewel-box interiors and holds court most mornings on a divan in its lobby. ""It's very difficult for people to place Zanzibar. Is it the Orient? Is it African? What is it?"" He paused. ""I think that's what makes it interesting.""

Spices remain one of Zanzibar's calling cards, though things have changed quite a bit over the centuries. ""Back in the day, pepper had as much value as cocaine today,"" said Raphael Flury, a Swiss lawyer who is now the director of the spice cooperative 1001 Organic in Stone Town. These days, Zanzibar's purported spice farms tend to mainly be for show, staging tours and performances geared toward visitors. In fact, many of the spices on sale in Zanzibar's markets are imported. Seeking a less commercial outing, I joined Mr. Flury and Ethan Frisch, a New York-based entrepreneur whose company, Burlap & Barrel, imports spices directly from farmers around the world. Mr. Frisch was in Zanzibar on a sourcing trip, and on a rare morning when the sun pried its way out of the clouds and held the raindrops at bay, I tagged along as they met with farmers growing nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper. ""Spices have been ignored in the global food revolution,"" Mr. Frisch said. ""There are heirloom tomatoes, single-origin coffee -- I'm trying to find heirloom spices."" While Burlap & Barrel procures everything from Icelandic kelp flakes to blue turmeric from Vietnam, Zanzibar had been Mr. Frisch's first scouting trip, in 2016. ""It's a place ignored by the global commodity trade, but with a significant history of spice trade.""

""A mixture of culture, rather than food,"" is how Mr. Abdela described urojo to me. The stew, popularly known as Zanzibar mix, is hearty, rainy-day food -- best slurped, not eaten. ""It's all the cultures of Zanzibar in a little bowl."" When I tried it for myself, it was as though my taste buds were circumnavigating the globe: a few chunks of mishkaki, or East African grilled meat, sliced off a skewer, were draped with Indian-inspired fried bhajias, local cassava strips and chunks of potatoes -- originally introduced to the region from the Americas by Europeans -- then layered with generous dollops of coconut chutney and fiery chile sauce and doused in a sour mango broth. The dumplings yielded deferentially to my fork, the soup was bright and citrusy, and each sloppy spoonful came laden with visions of the sunny afternoons and balmy weather that weren't written in my destiny. On most days, the storms were relentless, so it was a relief to escape the worst of the downpours with the promise of a meal. During one cloudburst, I ducked into Maa Sha Allah, a no-frills, cafeteria-style restaurant, to bide my time over a plate of beef masala; during another, I watched sheets of rain lash the beach from the cosseting confines of the Serena Hotel, where I tucked into kuku paka, a flavorful chicken-coconut stew, popular along the Swahili coast in Kenya and Tanzania. From a woman hunched in a sheltered nook off the side of the road I picked up a pillowy disk of mkate wa ufuta, sesame bread baked over coals, and ripped off chewy, perfectly charred chunks to nibble on a baraza, a shaded bench that's a fixture outside traditional Swahili houses.

I returned to satisfy my craving on another drizzly evening, bypassing stalls cranking out sugar cane juice and urojo to make a beeline for a row of pizza hawkers with names like Mr. Delicious and Mr. Big Banana before the rains triumphed again. I watched, entranced, as a jovial chef -- I'd gone with Mr. Nutella -- rolled out a mound of greasy dough, slick with oil and likely more than a few dashes of perspiration and rainwater. Against that gleaming canvas, he scattered minced beef, sprinkled a chiffonade of onions, tomatoes and green peppers, dressed it all with salt, mayonnaise, cheese and achaar (a spicy condiment), then cracked an egg on top of it before slapping it on a griddle until it attained that optimal level of chewy-crispy communion. Think of it as an adopted sibling of Italian pizza: the same last name, but a completely different genetic makeup. The concoction was more crepe than pizza, but the result tasted just as delicious as its laundry list of components might portend. I'd barely finished my last bite when I felt the unmistakable splat: first on my shoulder, then on my cheek, then on my head. Then everywhere, all at once. The rains were back without warning, though at this point I knew better than to expect one. I followed other diners to congregate under a feeble tent until it passed -- but what was the point? Instead, I splashed my way back out into the sticky night, soggy but satisfied."

James Poniewozik and Margaret Lyons, two television critics for The New York Times, conducted a brief conversation about puzzling picks and oversights, the rise of the limited series and what a virtual Emmy ceremony would -- or should -- even look like. JAMES PONIEWOZIK So it's still unclear what sort of TV we will have, or be making, in the fall, but we will at least have Emmys. Which is where I feel I should kick this off. I care a lot about TV. I have a harder time caring about TV awards even in the best of years. And this, you may have noticed, is not the best of years! I'm really dubious about the idea of an awards gala while the industry is still largely shut down (among other, more consequential things). That said, I also care about the people who care about TV, the people who make it and the people who watch it. If this helps them -- and us -- get through all of this a little more happily until we come out the other side, that's something.

MARGARET LYONS I guess, though I wonder if awards show enthusiasm should get categorized with pinchy shoes, tedious grooming regimens and pointless commutes -- I get why we did it, but we're not going back to that. We have a chance to do things another way! I love TV, too, but there's not a straight line between that and thinking the Emmys are a worthy pursuit. Anyway, no Rhea Seehorn, what a shame. PONIEWOZIK As for the nominations themselves: I have probably said before that limited series have taken the cultural spot from TV movies, a category that's almost an afterthought now. But looking at the nominees this year -- not to mention what wasn't nominated -- arguably they are also stealing the heat of drama series too.

You look, for instance, at ""Mrs. America,"" a historical drama from a writer of ""Mad Men"" that took some of that show's themes of feminism (and the reaction to it) forward another decade. ""Watchmen,"" arguably the show of the season well before the George Floyd protests underlined its relevance, a one-off season from Damon Lindelof of ""Lost"" and ""The Leftovers."" I was also glad to see a nomination for ""Unorthodox,"" which I loved but was afraid was too quiet to get notice. American TV is really discovering the power of the one-and-done.

LYONS Yeah, last year we both thought that the limited series category was better than the drama category, and this year ... that might be true again, partially because lots of great dramas did not get nominations. I know we both love ""David Makes Man,"" and I was surprised that ""The Good Fight"" didn't get any traction. I don't understand who thinks this season of ""Handmaid's Tale"" was good. On the variety sketch front, how can ""Sherman's Showcase"" and ""At Home with Amy Sedaris"" be shut out? This process is not healing me during quar! It is angering me, or at least making me wonder what people are getting from ""Mrs. Maisel"" that I am definitely not. PONIEWOZIK There's always an inertia issue with the Emmys, so for instance I guess ""Handmaid's"" has locked in the ""important and relevant"" niche in the minds of voters, however much it turns into an erratic dystopian roller coaster. Maybe ""The Good Fight"" suffered from having an incomplete season? (I only hope the voters were paying that much attention.) ""Pose"" deserved the ""Handmaid's"" spot for its even stronger second season. ""Sherman's"" deserved to be in a category that weirdly had a grand total of three nominees -- and I would love to see the talk category add some new blood, like a ""Patriot Act"" or ""Desus and Mero."" On a positive note, I always like to see credit due for great performances in less-great shows. I did not love ""The Morning Show,"" but Jennifer Aniston's portrait of a pressured, morally compromised star was terrific. (Steve Carell's shouty co-star turn, less so.) ""Black Monday"" is just a solid B show for me, but I do love Don Cheadle's swaggery energy in it. But man, while I'm turning to comedies, Pamela Adlon should file an insurance claim for the robbery that ""Better Things"" suffered.

LYONS ""Better Things"" deserves, yep, better. ""Lodge 49"" getting shut out is a bummer -- I wasn't expecting it to clean up, but it was entered as a comedy, and I think there's room in those categories for, oh, less ""Kominsky Method."" I am delighted to see ""What We Do In the Shadows"" do so well, though. I like comedies that make me laugh, not just think ""oh, that's funny,"" or ""how clever"" -- you know, the surprise and joy of true laughter! What a comedy can sometimes elicit! If I had one wish, I'd wish that ""BoJack Horseman,"" which was nominated for best animated program, gets the ""uh oh, it's your last season, and even though it was not the best season of the show, how can we let it go by completely? Oh, what fools we've been"" win, like Kyle Chandler finally getting an Emmy for ""FNL.""

PONIEWOZIK Even at that, a ""BoJack"" win will still be shunted off to the side, because of its category, when what it has actually been for six seasons was one of TV's best comedies. The Emmys often feel a little tangential to the TV conversation of the moment -- especially in terms of the categories that get prime-time attention. This wasn't the case with ""Watchmen,"" of course, but I read an interesting L.A. Times piece noting how the Emmys seems not to know what to do with documentary series -- despite how much bandwidth shows like ""The Last Dance"" take up. Even as someone who ultimately didn't like ""Tiger King"" (he's weird, we get the point), it does feel like one space where the Emmys are overlooking where TV is in 2020. (While devoting a lot of attention to ""Dead to Me."") LYONS ""Tiger King"" got seven nominations. Is that really overlooked? I will probably be stewing over snubs for a few more days -- ""Never Have I Ever,"" ""High Maintenance,"" ""My Favorite Shapes,"" I honor you in my own ways -- but maybe it's also time to be curious about what the actual Emmy ceremony will or should be. Calling in to a Zoom or whatever to lose an award feels incredibly stupid, but avoiding dumb things is not our culture's forte. PONIEWOZIK I get the ""The show must go on"" spirit. But a lot of things aren't going on now, with good reason, and maybe the Emmys should be one of them. I don't want to deny anyone their awards! (Send them FedEx!) But a virtual Emmys, without the crowd dynamics that the acceptance speeches thrive on, might just uncomfortably remind us of everything that's missing. But I reserve the right to be surprised by an ingenious production idea. Maybe they can find a way to hold the whole thing inside ""Animal Crossing."""
7253,A Basketball Brotherhood Calls Timeout,"A decades-long Manhattan pickup basketball game is on hold because of the pandemic, creating an emotional void for its rotating cast of actors, executives and regular joes.","Kevin Draughon, a former student at Trevor Day School, drove on Dan Feigin, who runs the pickup games on Saturdays at the school's gym.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/01/sports/01nba-buckspickup-06/01nba-buckspickup-06-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=db55e7b9b29d652086dc9426f878fe07f56c54916a606583c017bf610c300cd7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/sports/pickup-basketball-new-york.html,6b78ea2e-6951-58a7-b8f8-7227d1985beb.jpg,"As commissioner of one of New York City's longstanding pickup basketball games, Dan Feigin always knew where he would be every Saturday morning: inside the subterranean gymnasium at Trevor Day School in Manhattan, where he has worked for nearly three decades as a teacher, coach and administrator. But for the first time since 1992, the game has been shelved indefinitely because of the coronavirus pandemic. And even as the N.B.A. and other sports leagues begin to outline their plans for comebacks in the age of social distancing, weekend warriors like Feigin are coping with basketball-shaped voids in their lives. ""I wander around the house,"" Feigin said in a recent telephone interview. ""My wife is like, 'What are you doing?' I don't know what I'm doing!"" Feigin, 50, calls his game the Saturday Morning Run -- popularly known among its members as ""The Run"" or ""S.M.R."" -- and he has a massive collection of T-shirts to prove it. This year's edition comes stamped with the Roman numeral XXVIII, to commemorate the game's 28 years of existence. Feigin distributed the shirts in February to The Run's regulars during a weekend retreat to Milwaukee, where his twin brother, Peter, works as the president of the Bucks.

But there are also long-range shooters who work in retail sales and small forwards who direct nonprofits, photographers and writers, students and teachers. ""I've never seen less arguing in a serious pickup game,"" said Adam Keefe, a former N.B.A. power forward, who lives in Southern California but joins The Run whenever he travels to New York for his job in finance. ""It's kind of like the unwritten rule: Don't argue about anything. People who do argue are kind of not allowed back.""

""I thought I'd hit the jackpot,"" Feigin said. ""That was my dream of dreams when I was a kid: Oh, my God. I've got the keys to a gym."" His brother and Lee were just as excited. One Saturday, they gathered with some of their other pals -- including d'Amboise, who had been playing hoops with them for years -- and The Run was born. None could have anticipated how it would grow over the years, or the motley crew of characters who would be drawn to it. ""I always joke that we could run a country,"" d'Amboise said. Every Wednesday, Dan Feigin, now the director of Trevor's Upper School on the Upper East Side, sends a mass email to determine who will be playing that weekend. There are follow-up emails if his friends are slow to respond. But usually, The Run comprises a core group of 15 to 20 players who range from 16 to 58 years old. Feigin is in charge of divvying up the five-man teams at the start of the session -- and typically includes himself on the strongest squad. (There are perks to being commissioner.) The first game goes to 9 points, and every game after that goes to 7. Since 3-pointers are worth 2 points and 2-pointers are only worth 1, there is a strong premium on outside shooting. Defenders are responsible for calling fouls. There is an honor system. ""If someone kills you, they'll give you the ball,"" Dan Feigin said. Alex Woodhouse, 34, a photographer and musician who was a three-year starter at Colgate, joined the game in his mid-20s at the urging of a friend. Woodhouse had no idea what to expect. He was unfamiliar with Lasry, then his friend filled him in. ""A billionaire? With a 'B'?"" Woodhouse recalled asking him. But if Woodhouse had any qualms about digging in on defense against various titans of industry, he quickly learned that everyone was competitive.

""If you're not playing defense, they're going to call you out,"" said Woodhouse, who would temper his Friday night activities in anticipation of The Run. ""If I'm 25 and struggling to get up and down the court because I was out with my friends, and these guys who are running companies are showing up and playing ball, then I have no excuse. It became such a healthy place to be."" The Run also often doubles as a day care. If you lose, that might mean you need to keep an eye on several of your friends' toddlers. Back when the Feigins' (now teenage) sons were much younger, Lasry suspected that Peter or Dan would give them a secret signal to scamper onto the floor if their team was losing.

""That's just my view,"" Lasry said. ""But I could swear by the 10th time it happened, it was not an accident."" More recently, Tom Kearns, a mental health counselor and one of The Run's longtime staples, has been bringing his 12-year-old daughter, Sophia, so she can shoot hoops on the side with Dan Feigin's 12-year-old daughter, Dylan. Afterward, a big group heads to City Diner on Broadway for brunch. In all, about 100 players have played in The Run over the decades, some more luminous than others. When Lee was shooting his film ""The Best Man,"" he brought the actors Taye Diggs and Morris Chestnut to the gym. Lasry, who has been active in Democratic Party politics, has invited various campaign staffers. And everyone was thrilled when Keefe showed up. But no matter how skilled the player, new members are included on a probationary basis.

""Sometimes it goes up for judicial review to make sure the run is harmonious,"" Lee said. ""Do we want this guy to keep playing? Does he pass enough? Does he play defense?"" And if a new player does not endear himself to the group, it tends to reflect poorly on whoever invited him in the first place. ""That's a stain on your career,"" Dan Feigin said. Before life as we knew it went on hiatus in March, Peter Feigin was occasionally returning to New York from Milwaukee for weekend visits -- and to rejoin The Run, which has become multigenerational. Peter's son, Thomas, and Dan's son, Jackson, are both high school juniors and excellent players. They cause matchup problems for their fathers' friends. ""Being able to play ball with your son is kind of like the best of the best,"" Peter Feigin said. ""It's like winning the life lottery."" Marc Lasry, the co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks, has scaled back his play in recent years. ""As you get older, it's just harder to keep up with everybody."" Now, the lockdown has forced some of The Run's longstanding members to confront their athletic mortality. Lasry, 60, had already become less of a regular presence in recent years. ""As you get older, it's just harder to keep up with everybody,"" he said. Lee, 50, has worked to keep in shape by doing yoga and shooting hoops in his backyard. But he worries about the physical effects of another extended layoff. Last year, he was sidelined for several months while he recovered from an eye injury he had sustained in The Run. His sabbatical included a lengthy stint in Los Angeles on the set of ""Space Jam 2."" After he finally made his return to The Run in January, his comeback was cut short by the pandemic.

""I never wanted to be that guy with the goggles and the knee brace and the tucked-in shirt being like, 'Hey! Who's got next?' "" Lee said. ""If I become that guy, I don't need to play anymore. But I'm getting close to being that guy."" His friends, while the games are suspended, are trying to stay as prepared as possible. Kearns has been shooting at an abandoned hoop that he discovered behind a train station in Connecticut. Peter Feigin is riding his Peloton bike. And Dan Feigin still has keys to Trevor's gym, which he has been putting to use -- by himself. The entire Saturday morning crew has done a few Zoom calls. But while it is nice to connect, Kearns described the calls as ""artificial sweetener."" It is not the same. ""You miss falling on the ground,"" Dan Feigin said. ""You miss making a game-winning shot. You miss throwing that pass. You can't replicate that."""
44597,EJ Johnson Is 'Not Just Some Other Rich Girl',"Magic Johnson's son was outed as gay by TMZ, then became a reality show star. All of 25, he is now embracing his role as a gender-flouting role model.","EJ Johnson at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif., decorated in a style he calls ""modern princessy.""",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/03/fashion/03CVJOHNSON/03CVJOHNSON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4f48b5a14088469cb02081b75e0d2be0690be63b65d77e4258875e49ed7c7acb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/style/ej-johnson-rich-kids-of-beverly-hills.html,04ca11b7-6ee5-5af8-90bc-4cb486a1349f.jpg,"Credit...Molly Matalon for The New York Times



""Today we are talking about breaking boundaries,"" EJ Johnson declared from the stage of Beautycon, a two-day cosmetics festival held in August at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The 25-year-old son of Magic Johnson was moderating a panel called ""The Gender Revolution,"" and he was dressed for the part: black silk pants, crop top, sleeveless duster. ""We are talking about people who are not afraid to live their truth,"" he continued, in a white armchair flanked by neon palm trees. ""That is what beauty is all about, because it is in the eye of the beholder, honey."" He introduced the panelists: young beauty ""influencers"" who, like Mr. Johnson, belong to a generation whose vocabulary for gender and sexual identity has stretched to include every conceivable hue. One of them, a gender-fluid 17-year-old YouTube star named Brendan Jordan, said, ""I get asked if I'm a boy or a girl a lot. I'm just like, 'Yes.'"" Mr. Johnson nodded and added: ""That's just the way we're moving in the world, where everyone's just going to be one big gray area.""

""There wasn't any show that profiled a young person of color with a different sexual orientation living their life,"" he said at his apartment in Beverly Hills before the Beautycon panel. He was perched on a golden bar stool (the decor was what he called ""modern princessy"") in a translucent leopard-print robe, as a makeup artist applied blush. ""I'm not just some other rich girl who's trying to get a show."" EJ's public life began when he was still in the womb. On Nov. 7, 1991, Magic Johnson made the stunning announcement that he was H.I.V. positive and was retiring from the Lakers. At the time, H.I.V./AIDS was still widely thought to be a ""gay disease,"" a fallacy that Mr. Johnson's case helped dispel. The announcement came as his wife, Cookie Johnson, was two months pregnant with their first child, Earvin Johnson III. Cookie feared that she and the fetus might be H.I.V. positive as well (to say nothing of the revelation that Mr. Johnson had gotten the virus from another sexual partner), but they tested negative. EJ was born the following June, to parents grappling with a medical crisis, a marriage crisis and a publicity crisis. But he was unaware of his father's health issue until elementary school, when he was assigned a book report and found a book about his father in the library.

EJ was already discovering his flair for high fashion. ""I remember being, like, 4 and 5 and playing in my mom's closet,"" he said. ""But also asking questions like 'Who's this?' and 'What's that?,' and my mom explaining to me, 'This is a Chanel and this is a Versace.'"" Elisa Johnson, his 22-year-old sister, said, ""The older he got, the bigger his personality got."" (Mr. Johnson also has an older half brother, Andre Johnson.) ""We used to have these drawing sessions, and EJ's stick figures always had, like, a Louis Vuitton bag."" Through his father's H.I.V. advocacy, he had an early window into gay culture. He recalled going to AIDS fund-raisers at Elizabeth Taylor's house, where his mother explained that Ms. Taylor had lost gay friends to the epidemic. When he was 15, his mother caught him staring at boys on a vacation in Hawaii and initiated a conversation, but Mr. Johnson was still figuring out his sexuality. It wasn't until three years later, when he was about to leave for New York University, that he came out decisively to both parents.

""As a parent, I wanted EJ to know that we loved him and would always love him,"" Mr. Johnson said in an email. ""My job as a father is to protect him. His family and those that know him would always love him, but there would be people that don't know him and may not approve. Some people may not be nice, but it wasn't about him. I wanted to prepare him and let him know that I would always support him."" Cookie, a churchgoing Christian, was initially conflicted, later telling Oprah Winfrey, ""I had to pray about it."" Nowadays, both parents are publicly supportive, but EJ has stopped attending the West Angeles Church of God in Christ, where his parents are star congregants, saying, ""I remember sitting there in sermons and hearing some less than reputable things about homosexuals."" The matter was thrust into the open in 2013, when EJ was leaving a club on the Sunset Strip holding hands with a male friend. A TMZ reporter ambushed him with a camera, assuming he was out with his boyfriend. Mr. Johnson, who was 20, shrugged the whole thing off, until the tabloid called his father for comment. Back at N.Y.U., Mr. Johnson tried to ignore the online commotion. ""Everybody was texting me,"" he said. ""And I'm just like, 'Yo, what?'"" Nevertheless, he welcomed the opportunity to enter the limelight, telling Howard Bragman, a public relations veteran who has a YouTube show on gay issues: ""I'm reveling in it, and I'm making it work to my advantage.""

He was made a regular in the second season. Midseries, he underwent gastric-sleeve surgery and lost more than 100 pounds, showing off his transformed physique in slinky, flesh-revealing new outfits. ""EJNYC,"" which followed Mr. Johnson's chic adventures in Manhattan, spun off last summer and lasted six episodes. Elisa was a regular, and their parents also made appearances, with Magic calling in on FaceTime to tell EJ, ""Love your hair."" EJ had ambitious ideas for the series, like visiting a vogue ball and exploring the challenges that ""femme queens"" face in the gay dating world. But, in a foreseeable twist, he was dismayed at how the show portrayed him. ""I don't even recognize that person,"" he said. ""It was sad. It was, like, this is supposed to be my show and my moment, and it wasn't what I wanted at all. I mean, I looked good, but that was just me doing me.""

Now that reality stardom is behind him (for the moment), he is taking acting lessons and contemplating starting a fashion collection. It would be well timed, since the fashion industry has lately embraced androgyny with gusto, though sometimes in ways that gay and transgender advocates find exploitative. ""I don't think the fashion world has made any type of major huge strides, where we need to start commending anybody yet,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""They should probably start highlighting people who are doing it in the streets, as opposed to whatever celebrity they're putting in a skirt for five seconds just for publicity."" He may have been alluding to another celebrity offspring: Jaden Smith, the freethinking son of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, who appeared in women's clothing in Louis Vuitton's spring 2016 ad campaign. Asked about the campaign, Mr. Johnson said: ""If you're going to do it, I think you should go with somebody who's actually doing it because they genuinely get it as opposed to somebody who just has a name and was doing it just to be out there."" After the Beautycon panel, a talent wrangler named Demetria approached Mr. Johnson backstage and asked him to record a video message for her teenage son, Dany-e. ""Hi, Dany-e!"" Mr. Johnson cooed into her phone. ""I met your mom. You're so blessed to have her."" As he walked away, Demetria was teary. ""Watching his videos made him comfortable being himself,"" she said of Mr. Johnson's effect on her son. ""He could relate to someone."" Perhaps EJ Johnson is ""relatable"" after all."
60535,"The Name Changed, but Lost Nothing in Translation","A jewel of a museum in a city south of Berlin named for August Horch, the founder of Audi, provides a worthy reminder of how important Horch was to the auto industry.",AUDI HISTORY The August Horch Museum has a replica of a Standard filling station from the 1930s.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/06/automobiles/06HORC1/06HORC1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=5e9c4872dbce59cce13399cda5e7932a969ac9520f225d1c47586b4b2e8f78ae&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/automobiles/the-name-changed-but-lost-nothing-in-translation.html,eb6237d9-fd93-50c4-ad49-5044f5cc4485.jpg,"AMONG the early industrialists of Germany -- pioneering figures like Karl Benz, Gottlieb Daimler and Ferdinand Porsche, all linked to prominent automotive brands -- there is one whose name remains resolutely unfamiliar to Americans: August Horch. But even if the name is barely recognized in the United States, where the Horch brand had little presence, the influence of the company's founder is certainly felt. In a career that coincided with the dawn of the auto industry, Horch, who died in 1951, built cars that rivaled German competitors like Mercedes-Benz in style and prestige. Yet a quirk of corporate maneuvering that took place a century ago all but sealed Horch in obscurity. After a decade of building cars and racing them successfully, Horch was forced out of the company he founded. He started a new company in 1909, also called Horch, but was compelled through legal actions to change the name. Horch's solution was clever. The family name, which means ""hear"" in German, was replaced by its Latin equivalent: Audi.

The Horch and Audi companies were each folded into larger conglomerates in later years, with the Horch nameplate disappearing from cars entirely after World War II, while the Audi brand, as part of the Volkswagen empire, continues to thrive. There is a jewel of a museum named for the man in this small city, about 190 miles south of Berlin in what was East Germany, where Horch lived and worked for much of his life. The museum displays provide a worthy reminder of his innovations as well as other new technologies that helped to define the auto industry during its formative years. Developments like the early use of 6- and 8-cylinder engines, high-strength steels, advanced carburetors and transmissions -- and the introduction of left-hand drive to Germany -- can be seen in a collection that traces the history of Horch and Audi along with DKW and Wanderer. Together, the four brands are represented by the interlocking four rings of Audi's logo. Recognition for the artistry of Horch cars has been plentiful in recent years. In 2008, for example, a rare 1938 Horch 853 Special Roadster was sold in London for about $1.8 million by RM Auctions. And in 2009, the cognoscenti at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance chose an elegant 1937 Horch 853 cabriolet as Best of Show. The concours chairwoman, Sandra Button, described it as ""very Teutonic, but also almost French."" Zwickau is not a typical stop for most American tourists, though it's little more than an hour's drive from the ornately restored city of Dresden. The museum, at No. 7 Audistrasse, opened in 1988 with only five cars to display. It has since evolved into a modern exhibition of vehicles, words and pictures, and part of it is now housed in the original Audi factory.

""Many people come to us and say we have the prettiest museum in Europe,"" the director, Rudolf Vollnhals, said. ""Our visitors are enthusiasts, and we draw about 70,000 a year."" The museum itself is built on two levels, connected by ramps and easily negotiated. Chronology plays a part, as the displays trace the Horch legacy, dating from 1899, when August Horch & Cie was founded. After establishing Audi, Horch continued his participation in German road racing as a way to demonstrate the performance of his products. The point is reinforced by a yellow Audi Type B racecar from 1910 that greets visitors to the main hall. The advent of World War I complicated the car business in Germany, and much of the industrial facility was committed to military use. By the late '20s, Horch was in financial trouble. Audi was sold to a newly formed conglomerate called Auto Union that incorporated the DKW, Wanderer and Horch nameplates. Daimler Benz bought Auto Union in 1959, selling it five years later to the Volkswagen Group. The museum is financed in part by Audi and by the Federal Republic, and supported as well by contributions, said Mr. Vollnhals, who is an employee of Audi. There is another piquant tale told in the museum. ""From 1957 until 1991, the Trabant was built here and turned out more than three million cars over 30 years,"" Mr. Vollnhals said. The museum building was part of that production complex."

You try to question the battle merits of the Soviet World War II hero Alexei Botyan, presenting them as a myth. Mr. Botyan saved not only Krakow. He and the Red Army saved the Polish nation.

Mr. Botyan said in one of his last interviews:

""Several groups took part in saving Krakow. Both mine and the one led by Yevgeny Bereznyak. We had the only task: secure rapid advance of the Soviet troops to Krakow.

""Its saving is the most important achievement of my life.

""The Soviet Union not only helped liberate Poland, preserve its rich culture and traditions, but also restored its economy. Hitler sought to turn all inhabitants of the occupied Polish territories into slaves. Those who were not fit for these goals were planned for extermination. Such things should be remembered.

7424,"'Yourself and Yours' Review: Romance, Alcohol and a Puzzle",The South Korean director Hong Sang-soo puts viewers in tune with the world of his sad-sack characters immediately.,"Kim Ju-hyuk, left, and Lee Yoo-young in &ldquo;Yourself and Yours.&rdquo;",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/05/arts/04yourself/04yourself-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=f2ff0893ea3f9ac6c0c7a343dd57a9209007d8af02829bd0b8565d19c899944f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/movies/yourself-and-yours-review.html,c40ed28d-47f3-5561-a8c8-14301ecc5326.jpg,"The story spends much of its time following Young-soo in his abjection, which is well deserved -- the female friend in Young-soo's circle speaks a universal truth about Hong's males, and perhaps the gender in general, when she pronounces ""You men are really pathetic."" The more intriguing story line involves the female protagonist, or perhaps protagonists. Early in the movie, before even cutting off Young-soo, Lee's character is sitting in a coffee shop. An older man is startled to see her, and approaches her, calling her Min-jung. She's not Min-jung, she insists; she's never heard of such a person.

A few minutes later she relents, and says, yes, she knows Min-jung -- she's her twin sister! The man is placated, but he'll be agitated further when he happens upon her entertaining the aforementioned filmmaker.

The mystery is part of the movie's fun, and because this is a Hong film, there's no assurance it will be explained. Hong's earlier films were realistic, minimalist comedic looks at romantic yearning and misery (almost always exacerbated by alcohol). In this phase of his career, he's infusing his stories with magic realism elements either overtly (as in his 2018 movie ""Claire's Camera,"" which he made after this picture, and which rests on a temporal conundrum that's practically Borgesian) or implicitly, as in this film.

Hong's formal confidence yields a movie that's very simply constructed and utterly engrossing. There are a lot of scenes done in a single shot, usually static, but when there's a zoom (his preferred camera flourish) it's unfussy and direct. He puts you in tune with the world of his sad-sack characters immediately, and their rhythm becomes the rhythm of the story. By the end of the movie, we may suspect that one character has found an entirely novel and effective way of resetting a romantic relationship. Or that something weirder and creepier is going on. The pleasure is in not quite knowing.

26962,'The Crown': The History Behind Season 3 on Netflix,"As in past seasons, the latest installment of Netflix's show about the life and times of Queen Elizabeth II melds fact and fiction. Here's how The Times covered events depicted this season.","Season 3 of ""The Crown,"" which begins in 1964 and runs into the '70s, stars a new actress, Olivia Colman, right, as Queen Elizabeth II, pictured here in 1970.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/19/arts/19crown-historical-combo/19crown-historical-combo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4d69e62d1e6c32eaddc12b1057fb4625772995712ab35a7c42d7e95391deb471&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/arts/television/the-crown-season-3-netflix-history.html,6d924575-e058-5dba-b4a8-edae8d31708f.jpg,"The third season of ""The Crown,"" Netflix's opulent show about Queen Elizabeth II's reign and family, kicks off with an episode called ""Olding."" The title refers to both the queen's reaching middle age and to a spy scandal at the heart of the British establishment, a blending of the royals' private lives and state affairs that continues throughout the season's other nine episodes. Opening in 1964 and taking viewers into the '70s, Season 3 follows Elizabeth as she leads her country and family through a series of crises. As in previous seasons, the script imagines many private conversations and scenes of which there is no historical record. But The New York Times covered the real-life events that provide the backbone to each episode. Here's how the history behind the fiction was covered. You can explore more in the TimesMachine archive browser. (Warning: This feature contains spoilers for all 10 episodes of Season 3.) ""Old bat"" are the first words we hear from Olivia Colman's Queen Elizabeth, spoken as she inspects a new portrait of herself. This austere profile, betraying no emotion but designed to convey a sense of majesty, marked the queen's transition from a young princess to a settled monarch. It mirrors the queen's image that has been printed on British postage stamps since 1967.

The Times followed much of Princess Margaret's 1965 trip to America. A write-up of her dinner with President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House was on the front page the next day. The article called the dinner-dance ""small but unusually spectacular,"" yet apparently much less outrageous than how it was depicted on ""The Crown"": Margaret and the president danced, yes, while their spouses, the Earl of Snowdon and the first lady, did the fox trot; President Johnson offered the visiting couple tongue-in-cheek marital advice; and the princess left the dance at 1:35 a.m., late by White House standards, The Times reported. But there was no mention of bad-mouthing President John F. Kennedy or trading lewd limericks and kisses on lips, as the princess and president, played by Helena Bonham Carter and Clancy Brown, did in ""The Crown."" How important the dinner was for Britain, and whether the princess indeed softened the president to the idea of a loan, is unclear. A visit to the White House was on the schedule when Margaret took off from Britain, rather than being added last minute, as the show suggests. And a brief note in The Times after the visit said, ""Margaret and her husband, the Earl of Snowdon, had been asked to undertake official engagements during the United States trip."" [Read the front-page story about the White House dinner.] The third episode is entirely devoted to the 1966 Aberfan disaster, when a heap of rain-soaked coal waste collapsed on the mountain above a small mining village in Wales, creating a landslide of slurry that sped down the slope and killed more than 140 people. We see the head of state conspicuously absent from official visits to the grief-stricken community. Her prime minister, her brother-in-law and her husband all head to Aberfan before she finally decides to go. The episode is reminiscent of Season 1's ""Act of God,"" which depicted the London smog of 1952 and, through it, the plight of ordinary people far removed from the royals's world.

Season 3 shows Prince Philip (now played by Tobias Menzies) resolved to improve the public perception of the crown via television. This leads, of course, to mishaps. In 1969, The Times covered both of the royal television appearances shown in this episode. Philip's remarks about ""royal poverty"" on ""Meet the Press"" in the United States did indeed draw ""large headlines and grave editorials"" back home. (Although, some Britons responded by sending the queen small amounts of money.) But the BBC documentary about life inside the royal family may not have been the total fiasco this episode depicts. The film drew gasps and giggles from the press, but also fascination, according to a review in The Times. While in ""The Crown,"" the queen is adamant it should never be seen again ""anywhere, by anyone,"" in reality the film sold for record prices to networks in Australia and the United States, before disappearing from television screens after 1972. [Read The Times's review of ""Royal Family,"" from 1969.] ""A coup d'etat in the United Kingdom doesn't stand a chance,"" Lord Mountbatten (Charles Dance) tells a mysterious assembly of men plotting to oust the country's Labour government.

""He has become Britain's newest cover boy,"" a Times profile said of Prince Charles, ahead of his officially becoming the Prince of Wales in the summer of 1969. According to the piece, as in ""The Crown,"" the Welsh people warmed to him during his eight-week stay in Aberystwyth, where he studied Welsh history and language ahead of his speech at the formal event known as his investiture. The writer made no mention of his tutor, the Welsh nationalist activist Tedi Millward, but said the prince spoke Welsh with a ""surprisingly good accent,"" as we see in the show. At the ceremony, his voice sounded warm and calm, and was ""considered one of his most lovable assets by young women,"" The Times said. He also did say ""atmosphere,"" the word Josh O'Connor's prince wrestles with. But the references to his personal struggle for autonomy we see onscreen are a departure from the original speech. Prince Philip and his fascination with the 1969 moon landing is at the heart of the seventh episode, which ""The Crown"" uses to explore the duke's midlife crisis. That crisis is absent from contemporary pages of The Times, but the duke's passion for flying is not. In the same year as the moon landing, he flew himself to Canada. During his active years as a pilot, the prince spent nearly 6,000 hours in the cockpit before giving up flying in 1997, at the age of 76.

""I wanted to be an up-to-date king"" said the former King Edward VIII in a BBC interview in 1970, implying that was something the royal family couldn't handle. The program was the first time the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson, the American woman for whom he abdicated the throne in 1936, had spoken to the BBC. The 75-year-old Duke, who lived in exile in Paris when the interview was broadcast, described himself as a little past the age of being ""with it,"" but that his doctor had prescribed him marijuana to help him cut down on his tobacco smoking. The eighth episode of this season of ""The Crown"" shows the royal family observing all this publicity around the Windsors with scorn. Prince Philip is adamant the queen should not visit the former monarch. But, according to The Times, the queen, Prince Philip and Prince Charles did call at his house in Paris shortly before his death in 1972. The Times carried two front page obituaries for the Duke of Windsor: A quick take from news wires on the day of his death, and a longer version the day after. [Read The Times's review of the 1970 BBC interview with the Windsors.] This episode depicts twin quarrels: a romantic struggle inside the palace and a battle for wages in the streets. The Times provided no details of Camilla Shand's appearance in the life of the royal family. Nor did it cover her relationship with Prince Charles and marriage to Andrew Parker-Bowles, as arranged by the queen mother in ""The Crown."" The nationwide blackouts caused by striking coal miners did, however, make it into the paper, with ample details of the strange atmosphere. It was ""just like World War II,"" one shopper told The Times in 1972. ""The dark streets and the people being friendly again, I tell you, I accept it very well."" The paper also noted that Britons endured the discomfort without much complaint, just as we see the onscreen royal family stoically using candles to light Buckingham Palace.

Most of this season's final episode is devoted to Princess Margaret's ongoing search for happiness, and the accompanying feverish press interest in her personal life. When she and her husband announced their separation in 1976, The Times put it on the front page. The cause of the split, the report said, was the highly publicized ""friendship"" between the princess and Roddy Llewellyn, who ""went to Eton and sometimes wears a silver earring,"" and shares a farmhouse ""on a commune basis"" with seven others, The Times said. A photograph of the two in Mustique, in the West Indies, was the final straw for Lord Snowdon, The Times reported. As depicted in the show, Margaret and Tony (played by Ben Daniels) were reported to already lead virtually separate lives. The Times article also listed three of Lord Snowdon's ""women friends."" The season finale shows Margaret attempting suicide after a row with Lord Snowdon over Roddy Llewellyn. The attempt was not mentioned by The Times, but speculated about in the British media."

Zuni isn't the trendiest place with the splashiest fare, but the Market Street restaurant, celebrating its 40th anniversary, has been a hip destination since it opened in 1979.

Housed in a quirky triangular brick building, with tall, tall windows that let in the brilliant Pacific light on clear days and misty, gray light on cloudy ones, it has always attracted an eclectic crowd: near-penniless students and opera divas, lawyers and socialites, artists and performers, first-daters and anniversary-celebrators, youngsters and oldsters, locals and travelers, politicians and free spirits, serious foodies and serious tipplers.

In the beginning, when it was little more than a storefront with a minimal kitchen, Zuni veered Mexican. Billy West, the founding chef, served a stellar guacamole, prepared table-side in molcajetes, the volcanic stone mortars. The place was packed. A shop next door, Red Desert, sold giant potted cactuses.

When the restaurant expanded, doubling in size, it was time to hire a real chef. The kitchen was taken over and transformed by Judy Rodgers, a talented young cook with the perfect resume for a somewhat-oddball restaurant like Zuni."
58118,"The Fed, Lawrence Summers, and Money","Among the top contenders to lead the Fed, Lawrence H. Summers has by far the most Wall Street experience and the most personal wealth.","Among the top prospects to oversee the Fed, Lawrence H. Summers leads in Wall Street experience, and wealth.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/11/business/sub-summers/sub-summers-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=399&w=600&s=16122416745c084a06c56dbbae9ed03bb7d3daee4ed3c9ca17d52a7e545f7df8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/11/business/economy/the-fed-lawrence-summers-and-money.html,79da92a1-6c34-5f3a-9778-4f06c4245959.jpg,"When Lawrence H. Summers left his job as President Obama's top economic policy adviser at the end of 2010 to return to Harvard University, one of his first steps was to set up a roster of part-time positions that would touch on just about every corner of the financial world. But as he negotiated with a prominent venture capital firm in Silicon Valley, Mr. Summers made one thing very clear: he needed an exit plan, in case he returned to public service. ""That was generally the assumption,"" said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the firm. ""If he did, he needed a way to do a clean disengage."" Today, the Obama administration is considering nominating Mr. Summers as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. If the White House does so, Mr. Summers's financial disclosure -- including his recent consulting jobs, paid speeches and service on company boards -- will be one of the hottest documents in Washington. Among the top contenders for the position, Mr. Summers has by far the most Wall Street experience and the most personal wealth.

In addition to rejoining the Harvard faculty in 2011, he jumped into a moneymaking spree. His clock was ticking partly because he knew that the Fed chairmanship, to which he has long aspired, was likely to open up in early 2014, when Ben S. Bernanke's second term will come to an end. ""With Larry, my wife always says that it's hard to be happy if you want to have the most money because you'll never have the most money,"" said Jeremy I. Bulow, an economics professor at Stanford University who is a friend and co-author of academic papers with Mr. Summers. ""He's kind of been going about his life just on the basis of 'who knows what's going to come next?' and just sort of maximizing his experiences, given the opportunities in front of him."" The opportunities have been many over the last two years. Mr. Summers, 58, has been employed by the megabank Citigroup and the sprawling hedge fund D. E. Shaw. He works for a firm that advises small banks as well as the exchange company Nasdaq OMX. And he serves on the board of two Silicon Valley start-ups: both financial firms that may pursue initial public offerings in the next year. One of them, Lending Club, offers loans to consumers and small businesses by making arrangements directly with online investors, a new business model that falls into a regulatory gap that consumer advocates say may lead to risky borrowing. Before his tenure in the Obama administration, Mr. Summers had accumulated personal wealth of at least $7 million; the last two years have most likely added considerably to that. But his money and Wall Street connections put him in an awkward position, partly because the next person to lead the Federal Reserve will oversee the writing of several key new regulations from the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill.

Still, some senators are speaking out against Mr. Summers. They are raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and noting his role in the repeal of the Glass-Steagall law, which limited the sorts of activities banks could undertake, and his opposition to regulating derivatives in the 1990s -- decisions that many critics say contributed to the financial crisis. ""I start from a position of being extraordinarily skeptical that Larry Summers is appropriate to chair the Fed,"" said Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon. ""I have serious doubts that Mr. Summers, who as a committed deregulator drove policies that set the stage for the Great Recession, is the right person for a key regulatory position."" Mr. Summers declined to comment. But whatever his views on regulatory policy, those who know and admire Mr. Summers say he arrived at them honestly. ""There has to be a distinction between talking to people, even for payment, and doing what they want you to do,"" said Robert Z. Lawrence, a professor who taught a course at Harvard with Mr. Summers this year. ""When it comes to Larry Summers, for good or for bad, he's uncontrollable when it comes to the positions he takes. He doesn't take them for that reason."" Mr. Summers's wealth comes mainly from two periods of private sector work between government postings. After a lengthy tenure at the Treasury Department in the 1990s, he became the president of Harvard -- a job that Robert E. Rubin, who preceded Mr. Summers as Treasury secretary, helped him obtain. But in 2006, Mr. Summers was forced out of the university presidency for a variety of reasons, including remarks he made questioning why few women engage in advanced scientific and mathematical work. Soon after, a young Harvard alum brought him into the hedge fund world with a part-time posting at D. E. Shaw. That firm, one of the largest in the industry, paid Mr. Summers more than $5 million.

Mr. Summers's wealth soared from around $400,000 in the mid-1990s to between $7 million and $31 million in 2009, when he joined the Obama administration, according to a financial disclosure he filed at the time. Before returning to government service, he earned $2.7 million from speeches in one year alone. As for his current work, representatives for Citigroup, Nasdaq and D. E. Shaw declined to disclose his pay. His speaking rates today run into the six figures, according to an associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and Mr. Summers has spoken to Wall Street companies like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. The job that is likely to generate the most scrutiny for Mr. Summers is his work with Citigroup, which was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by the federal government's bailout. Though he does not have an office there, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said he was a regular consultant. In a statement, Citigroup said he provided ""insight on a broad range of topics including the global and domestic economy"" to prestigious clients, and attended internal meetings. Citigroup hired Mr. Summers in part to advise Vikram S. Pandit, who resigned as chief executive last year. With his work there, Mr. Summers followed in the footsteps of his friend, Mr. Rubin, who joined Citigroup after he left the government and earned more than $100 million.

""It will certainly give him a lot of windows into different parts of the financial system, different parts of the economy,"" Mr. Sachs said. Asked why Mr. Summers would not have simply opted out of financial work, given the questions it could raise if he were nominated to lead the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bulow, the Stanford economist, said he thought Mr. Summers's early experience with cancer (at the age of 28, he was treated for Hodgkin's disease) had been formative. It shaped him to make decisions based on present options, Mr. Bulow said, rather than worrying about future unknowns, like whether President Obama would choose him for the Fed. ""He doesn't proceed that way,"" Mr. Bulow said. ""I think basically, you know, it's a little bit like Sheryl Sandberg says, 'Don't leave before you're leaving.' "" Mr. Summers's spokeswoman, Kelly Friendly, declined to provide details about his current pay, but said his ""broad exposure to different parts of the economy gives him a unique perspective on what makes America work."" In 2009, Mr. Summers said in an interview with The New York Times that he kept boundaries between his private and public work. ""I wanted to be involved as an economist, not as a lobbyist,"" he said. ""I never wanted to be in a position of taking public policy positions based on anything other than my convictions as an economist or a potential policy maker."" Mr. Summers not only has a variety of professional contacts on Wall Street, he also has many friends there. At D. E. Shaw, for instance, Mr. Summers has worked with Darcy Bradbury, the firm's head of external affairs, who has known him for more than 30 years, ever since she was a student at Harvard. Ms. Bradbury, who also worked with Mr. Summers in the Clinton administration, was elected chairwoman of the hedge fund industry's association shortly after Mr. Summers began his work in the White House in 2009. That group, the Managed Funds Association, has been involved in discussions of industry trading rules as well as pushing for the preservation of a tax loopholes that benefit investment firms.

Richard W. Painter, a former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, predicted that Mr. Summers's work in finance would not derail his nomination or confirmation. ""Remember, we had two secretaries of the Treasury, which is a regulatory position, who were chairmen of Goldman Sachs,"" said Mr. Painter, who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota. ""We did it with Hank Paulson. Clinton did it with Bob Rubin."" Mr. Painter noted that if Mr. Summers became Fed chairman, he would have to fully divest himself of all interests in the financial companies he works with. The divestitures, he said, would include even the start-ups, companies that have the potential for Mr. Summers to make sizable future earnings, if they pursue public offerings. If Mr. Summers goes to the Fed, Mr. Andreessen said, ""it would be a reasonable statement that he's leaving money on the table.""

Consumer advocates said Lending Club was so new that they had not yet seen many examples of its loans and collection practices in action. But Sarah Ludwig, the co-director of the New Economy Project, a nonprofit in New York, expressed concern that the company did not verify all borrowers' income and employment. ""This should be another red flag,"" Ms. Ludwig said of Mr. Summers's involvement. ""What is he doing on the board of this company? What is a potential Fed chairman doing on the board of a company that doesn't check if people can afford loans?"" Of the loans Lending Club has made in 2013, it did not verify income about half of the time, according to data available on its Web site. Mr. Laplanche said the company had models that dictated when it scrutinizes income and that the company was verifying income on more loans than it did in the past. He said that many other lenders also did not verify employment history and income. He added that Mr. Summers had pushed for strong consumer protection. ""He was the most adamant about making sure we were tracing the loan in such a way that we were making sure the people getting the loan had the ability to repay,"" he said. And he said consumers would not be coming to Lending Club if they thought they could get better rates elsewhere. But some consumer credit experts said Lending Club's rates on many loans might be higher than what was available at a credit union or other lenders. Of the loans Lending Club has issued in 2013, 12.9 percent of the loans are charging annual percentage rates of 12.4 percent or lower, but 37 percent of the loans are charging annual percentage rates of 19 percent or more, with some as high as 29 percent. Mr. Summers has been encouraging Lending Club to spend time in Washington to share its story with regulators and policy makers, said John J. Mack, another company board member who was the chief executive of Morgan Stanley during the financial crisis. ""The facts are all over the place, but to me, for it to be growing at the rate it is growing, it is serving a need for small consumers,"" Mr. Mack said."

Tania Leon worked for the New York Philharmonic in the 1990s. But the full orchestra is only now performing her work.

She was supposed to end up in Paris. When the composer Tania Leon was 9, her piano teacher, traveling in France, sent a postcard back to Cuba with a picture of the Eiffel Tower. ""I don't know what happened to me when I saw the card,"" Ms. Leon, now 76, said recently. ""I went to my family, and I said, 'This is where I'm going to live.' And I became obsessed."" A few years earlier, her intrepid grandmother had marched her to the local music conservatory in Havana and demanded that she be enrolled. They didn't usually take students so young, but Ms. Leon already showed promise: Even at 4, she would press against the radio at home, dancing to salsa and singing along, with perfect pitch, to the classical station. Following rigorous, European-style conservatory training, and inspired by her teacher's postcard, the young pianist set her sights on France, intent on becoming a touring virtuoso and helping lift her family out of poverty. After years of waiting, she landed a free flight to the United States through a resettlement program. In 1967, at 24, Ms. Leon left for Miami, intending to travel on to Europe. But right before boarding the plane she learned that she would not be permitted to return to Cuba, and upon entering the United States, she discovered that she would have to stay at least five years before she could apply for citizenship. She was trapped, a citizen of nowhere.

But she soon reached New York, where she began carving out an unusually varied artistic path and resisting, even at a time of increasing focus on multiculturalism, the identity-based labels -- ""black composer,"" ""female conductor"" -- that others sought to attach to her. She eventually served as the New York Philharmonic's new-music adviser in the mid-1990s. Although she curated the Philharmonic's American Eccentrics series and conducted educational concerts, the orchestra, which had a weak record with composers of color at that time, stymied some of her projects and never actually played her music. But this week she finally arrives at the Philharmonic, with the premiere of her work ""Stride,"" to be performed on Feb. 13, 15 and 18, under Jaap van Zweden. The premiere is part of Project 19, a multiseason initiative in honor of the centenary of the 19th Amendment, that has commissioned works by 19 female composers. Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic's executive director in the '90s, returned as president and chief executive in 2017, and was eager to finally program Ms. Leon's music. ""Here we are,"" Ms. Borda said in an interview, ""coming back to an important artist and enfranchising her, over 20 years later.""

Ms. Leon's trajectory in America, from displaced pianist-in-training to compositional force, began with upheaval. Not long after she arrived, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated; Ms. Leon barely spoke English, but found herself shouting slogans at antiwar protests. She was overwhelmed with stress, and her hair began to fall out. But propelled by talent, tenacity and a bit of luck, she began to reverse her fortunes. She played her way into a scholarship at the New York College of Music. Substituting for a friend as an accompanist to dance classes, she was spotted by the famed New York City Ballet dancer Arthur Mitchell. He was starting a new venture, the Dance Theater of Harlem, and recruited Ms. Leon as music director. Soon, Jerome Robbins and George Balanchine were teaching Ms. Leon their repertoire. ""What freaked me out the most,"" she recalled with a laugh in an interview in the Philharmonic's archives, poring over old program booklets and photographs, was ""when I found out that Stravinsky was alive, and that Stravinsky had written three or four ballets for Arthur Mitchell.""

At Mitchell's behest, she began conducting, improvising and, increasingly, composing. Her tendency was to say yes to every opportunity, and not fret too much about what it might entail. ""People that I respect a lot, they tell me something seriously and I think about it, but I don't become negative,"" she said. ""He told me, 'Write a piece.' And I said, 'Wow.' So I wrote the piece."" She honed her voice in large-scale, percussive dance works that dabbled in the serial techniques in vogue in the 1970s. The Dance Theater became an international sensation, and its tours even took her, finally, to Paris.

At last she was able to return home, through a Cuban government family reunification program. Visiting Havana in 1979, she went first to the cemetery to see her formidable grandmother, who had died while she was abroad. She played recordings of her new compositions for her father, who remained skeptical. ""He told me, 'Where are you in your music?'"" she recalled. ""He knew something about me that I was not addressing in my sound."" ""When you come from one land into another, one culture into another, you want to be assimilated,"" she added. ""You want to learn the traditions, you want to learn the gestures."" To remind her of her roots, her father took her to a Santeria ceremony, where she heard the polyrhythmic music that she had absorbed growing up, but which had remained absent from her early professional work. She returned to the United States, and soon after, her father suffered a stroke and died. Visa issues kept Ms. Leon from attending his funeral. She began having nightmares in which she heard pounding drums. She was working on a piece for solo cello, and started to sketch out a movement based on her father's rhythmic gait, in the style of a syncopated montuno. The grand mixture that is Cuban music -- its intricate grooves, melodic inflections, arrays of drums -- began flowing into her compositions.

""I was searching myself, trying to address something,"" she recalled of those years, describing it as a period of ""trying to understand my own culture."" The music's central impulse is a forceful, bustling modernism, with angular and pointillistic gestures undergirded by kinetic, perpetual motion. She also became an outspoken advocate for cultural diversity. Alongside her pathbreaking career as a conductor, Ms. Leon spearheaded a pioneering outreach program at the Brooklyn Philharmonic and led community concerts across that borough. She oversaw major festivals of Latin American music with the American Composers Orchestra, served as music director of the Broadway production of ""The Wiz,"" and testified at city hearings about the integration of pit orchestras. Today, she directs the wide-ranging festival Composers Now, which is going on across New York through February. But as her career unfolded, Ms. Leon bristled at attempts to define her. Her background is mixed -- she has family roots in Spain, France, Africa and China -- and the seemingly binary categories of race and gender circumscribed her individuality.

""I am tired of all our labels,"" she said in 1986. ""I am nothing that the people want to call me. They do not know who I am. The fact that I am using this physical costume does not describe my energy, does not describe my entity. My chosen purpose in life is to be a musician, a composer, a conductor. This is the way I am making my contribution to mankind."" She saw herself as a global citizen, a cosmopolitan figure boxed in by categories that had confined people of color for hundreds of years. The scholar Alejandro Madrid, who is writing a biography of Ms. Leon, observed recently that this ethos was grounded in her arrival in the United States in the late '60s, toward the end of the civil rights movement. ""Identity politics are very strong,"" he said of that period, ""and she never felt very comfortable with it."" He added, ""The ambivalences she has about blackness come out of the specific experience of her being in New York at this time, and being always labeled something that she didn't believe she really was."" Ms. Leon's position is largely the same today: She praised the Philharmonic's Project 19 as a ""reparations gesture"" but also argued that ""any label limits the person."" ""I honor all my ancestors in my skin, and in my character, and my presence,"" she said. ""But I don't go around saying I'm Cuban-Italian, or I'm Cuban-French, or I'm Cuban-this and Cuban-that.""

Nearly two decades ago she moved to Nyack, a village on the Hudson River north of Manhattan, seeking more space. ""I always lived in places where, every time I looked out the window, I was looking at someone else,"" she said. Today, Ms. Leon remains a bit astonished by the trajectory of her life and career. ""I consider what happened to me to be a miracle,"" she said. She attributes some of her success to mystical forces, adding: ""I still talk to the spirits of my ancestors."" Her music is still infused with a vigorous pluralism, although it is a bit more relaxed -- less harsh, less busy -- than her earlier efforts. (Little of her recent work has been commercially recorded.) The Philharmonic will present a Nightcap concert on Feb. 15 that explores her myriad influences, with guests including the jazz harpist Edmar Castaneda. ""Stride,"" her new work for the orchestra, is inspired by two women: the suffragist Susan B. Anthony and the grandmother who was a major presence in Ms. Leon's life -- a progressive who embraced socialism as soon as it reached Cuba. ""Stride,"" unfolding in a series of fitful episodes -- thickets of glassy strings, declamatory brass and contrapuntal juxtapositions that evoke Charles Ives -- is both solemn and celebratory. It is also aware of the racialized limits on the enfranchisement that women won a century ago. Its final moment offers a note of prophetic dissent: As two percussionists symbolically ring 19 tubular bells, a third plays a rhythmic pattern based on a clave from West Africa. ""That is the symbol of the people of color,"" Ms. Leon said. ""It's like, this is next."" ""It's the 100th anniversary,"" she added. ""A lot of things have changed, a lot of things need to change, and that is my very personal comment. That we're celebrating something that was handicapped, and something that is still handicapped."""

* None   Kelly Blackmon for The New York Times

Greenville, S.C., near the Blue Ridge Mountains, has emerged as a buzzy destination for the culinary and creative arts after years of economic growth and urban revitalization. One of the U pcountry city's most intriguing areas is West Greenville, the former hub of the city's textile production. In recent years, the enclave known as ""The Village"" of West Greenville has been transformed into an artistic and entrepreneurial district with an eclectic mix of small businesses. There's a James Beard-semifinalist restaurant, a host of independent galleries, as well as the Greenville Center for Creative Arts, which houses an art school and regularly holds public events and workshops. The Greenville Center for Creative Arts is largely responsible for putting the Upcountry city on the national visual arts map. Kelly Blackmon for The New York Times West Greenville's biggest cultural draw, the four-year-old Center for Creative Arts, is housed in the city's historic cotton factory and is largely responsible for putting Greenville on the national visual arts map. The center includes an expansive gallery featuring work from on-site studio artists and fellows, as well as another gallery dedicated to local and regional talents. It also runs permanent and temporary exhibits and events (like Greenville's most popular monthly open-house, First Friday, which is free and geared toward engaging the community). The Anchorage was a semifinalist for best new restaurant in the 2018 James Beard Awards. Kelly Blackmon for The New York Times The marquee restaurant i n the city's burgeoning dining scene is an ode to local ingredients. A semifinalist for best new restaurant in the 2018 James Beard Awards, the spot has a rotating menu of small plates that might include homemade pasta with Johnston County ham, arugula and garlic, and a salad of Brussels leaf, daikon kimchi, and rainbow carrots topped with albacore tuna, all served on dishware designed by the local potter Darin R. Gehrke . The chef Greg McPhee, an alum of Husk in Charleston and Restaurant 17 in nearby Traveler's Rest, set up shop in the village's former mill infirmary in 2017, making The Anchorage the space's first tenant in 40 years. You can't miss it: The revitalized corner building has a facade kitted out with a vibrant mural depicting a vegetable garden. The Village Grind, which opened four years ago, serves specialty coffee and pastries. Kelly Blackmon for The New York Times This four-year-old cafe has an intimate, rustic aesthetic and specialty coffee expertise. With beans sourced from local roasters like Methodical and Due South Coffee, the shop serves pastries, from morning buns to chocolate croissants and doughnuts (Sundays only), made each morning by neighborhood bakers, including Bake Room and Golden Brown & Delicious. The Flatiron Building houses the studios and galleries of local artists and craftspeople, including Joseph Bradley, above, whose paintings are nature-inspired. Kelly Blackmon for The New York Times The triangular, two-story brick building on the corner of Pendleton Street houses the studios and galleries of the city's most promising artists and craftspeople . The nature-inspired paintings of Joseph Bradley are perhaps the most well-known outside of Greenville, having appeared in shows and galleries from New Orleans to Boston, and have a permanent home in Charleston's Atrium Art Gallery. Indigo Flow & Art is a hybrid yoga studio and art gallery that opened in 2018. Kelly Blackmon for The New York Times Opened in 2018, the hybrid yoga studio and art gallery with a philanthropic bent is run by Katie Hughes, a certified yoga instructor, and her artist mother, Julie Hughes. The art-focused section of the space features permanent collections by Ms. Hughes, who describes her signature style as ""abstracted realism,"" and selected works by local and regional artists. The minimalist yoga and meditation studio is in the back of the shop, where Katie Hughes offers Vinyasa and Chakra yoga, mat Pilates, and meditation, as well as beginner classes for kids. The mother-daughter duo allocates 10 percent of monthly profits toward their Indigo Outreach yoga and mindfulness program, created for at-risk youth in the community. 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian Modak, on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

6893,Michael Flynn and the Presumption of Guilt,A distrust of prosecutorial power should not be abandoned.,"Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn delivering a speech on the first day of the Republican National Convention on July 18, 2016 in Cleveland.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/22/opinion/22stephens1/22stephens1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=65bc1d1de10634214247b992ecefa09e468b21156cf2efaf922de371c3420fda&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/opinion/michael-flynn-case-dropped.html,fba1d153-567d-56f8-8f31-751270acdec1.jpg,"Of all the low moments in the 2016 Republican presidential convention -- there were many -- Michael Flynn's speech ranks high. ""Damn right, exactly right,"" the fired, retired three-star general said in answer to audience chants of ""lock her up."" ""And you know why we're saying that? We're saying that because if I, a guy who knows this business, if I did a tenth, a tenth of what [Hillary Clinton] did, I would be in jail today."" This was said by a man who, as a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and top foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump, had already taken $45,000 from the K.G.B. regime in Moscow and would later take $530,000 from the Islamist regime in Ankara as an unregistered foreign agent. If Flynn had been prosecuted, judged and sentenced according to his own moral arithmetic, he'd be behind bars today. Fortunately he isn't, because sleazy behavior isn't the same as criminal conduct. By now, every thoughtful observer should have learned two things from the experience of the Trump administration.

The first is that few things in politics are as despicable as efforts to use the power of the state to criminalize a political opponent. That's why Trump's efforts to bully a foreign ally into digging up dirt on his domestic opponent was so reprehensible. That's why Trump deserved his impeachment. The second is that civil liberties matter, never more so than when a government seeks to prosecute the people it dislikes by hiding exculpatory evidence, using deceptive methods, relying on outdated laws or threatening them with financial or familial ruin. Yet as Bloomberg columnist Eli Lake lays out in painstaking detail in an essay for Commentary magazine, this is what happened to Flynn. This has been obscured by the fact he twice pleaded guilty to a crime he likely did not commit, as part of an investigation into a conspiracy that the Mueller investigation could not prove. It's obscured because some of the sensational reporting about him that once appeared solid later turned out to be dubious. And it's obscured because the administration's inveterate critics have a hard time conceding that the theory in which they were politically and emotionally invested -- that the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia to steal the election -- was built on a shaky foundation. What, after all, is the supposed case against Flynn? There's the claim that he undermined American interests by urging the Russian ambassador not to expel American diplomats in Russia. But that was a request in the service of American interests, not against them. There's the argument that the call violated the 1799 Logan Act. But nobody has been convicted under that act and calls between incoming administration officials and foreign diplomats are hardly unprecedented.

There is his alleged lying to F.B.I. agents about his conversation with the Russian ambassador. But the bureau's record of the interview shows the agents thought Flynn ""did not give any indicators of deception,"" according to the Justice Department's motion to dismiss the case. There is the suggestion that Flynn exposed himself to Russian blackmail by supposedly lying to Mike Pence about the call with the ambassador. But as Lake astutely points out, ""Perhaps it was Pence who lied, because he was asked a question he found difficult to answer on national television."" Of course, there is Flynn's guilty plea. But Flynn -- like so many defendants in the U.S. justice system-- pleaded guilty to avoid having a different charge, in his case the foreign-registration issue in the Turkish matter, thrown at him and his son. What that has to do with an investigation into Russian meddling in the American election is a question to ponder. Against all this, consider the behavior of the F.B.I. In December, the Justice Department's independent inspector general noted that the bureau repeatedly misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court in its investigation of Russian collusion. As for Flynn, the F.B.I. discouraged him from having counsel present for the interview. It did not alert him that he was a target of a secret investigation. It withheld the transcript of his call, meaning that any discrepancy between Flynn's memory and the transcript could be termed a lie rather than simple misremembering. It did not ask him direct questions about his conversations with Pence, though the rationale for the interview was to clear up supposed discrepancies between the record of his call and Pence's televised comments. It later withheld from his counsel a key memo detailing the F.B.I.'s previous attempts to find evidence that he was a Russian asset, which had come up empty-handed. What this amounts to, Lake writes, is ""not only an injustice against Flynn but an assault on the peaceful transition of presidential power. The F.B.I.'s job is not to entangle the new president's national-security adviser in a spurious investigation."" Liberals used to have a healthy distrust of prosecutorial power, just as they had a healthy belief in the presumption of innocence. In the Tara Reade story, they've been reminded of the political folly of abandoning the second belief. It may not be long before they learn a similar lesson about the folly of abandoning the first."
14199,The Rise and Fall of the 'Stop the Steal' Facebook Group,"In its short life span, it was one of the fastest growing groups in Facebook's history and a hub for those trying to delegitimize the election.",Protesters attended a #StoptheSteal rally at the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg on Thursday.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/06/business/05facebooksteal-print/05facebooksteal-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=52229832470404003e02ffc098d0235865f3eefefea474d0bc1b740ce11d86de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/technology/stop-the-steal-facebook-group.html,eb402487-1dd3-5583-9246-c8f7ebbe64ea.jpg,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- The first post in the new Facebook group that was started on Wednesday was innocuous enough. ""Welcome"" to Stop the Steal, it said. But an hour later, the group uploaded a minute-long video to its Facebook page with a pointed message. The grainy footage showed a crowd outside a polling station in Detroit, shouting and chanting ""stop the count."" Below the video, which was quickly shared nearly 2,000 times, members of the group commented ""Biden is stealing the vote"" and ""this is unfair."" The viral video helped turn the Stop the Steal Facebook group into one of the fastest-growing groups in Facebook's history. By Thursday morning, less than 22 hours after it was started, it had amassed more than 320,000 users -- at one point gaining 100 new members every 10 seconds. As its momentum grew, it caught the attention of Facebook executives, who shut down the group hours later for trying to incite violence.

Even so, the Stop the Steal Facebook group had done its work. In its brief life span, it became a hub for people to falsely claim that the ballot count for the presidential election was being manipulated against President Trump. New photographs, videos and testimonials asserting voter fraud were posted to the group every few minutes. From there, they traveled onto Twitter, YouTube and right-wing sites that cited the unsubstantiated and inaccurate posts as evidence of an illegitimate voting process.

The idea of a stolen election quickly spread among Mr. Trump's supporters, including to a Facebook user named Kylie Jane Kremer. Ms. Kremer, 30, a former Tea Party activist, runs a conservative nonprofit called Women for America First. She created the Stop the Steal Facebook group. In an interview on Thursday from a protest in Atlanta, Ms. Kremer said she had started the Facebook group after speaking with conservative activists and seeing social media posts about voter fraud. She said she wanted to help organize people across the United States on the issue and centralize discussions over protests and rallies. ""I knew other people saw this the same as I did, that there were people out there trying to steal the election from the rightful person,"" Ms. Kremer said, referring to Mr. Trump. ""I wanted us to be able to organize to take action."" Once the Facebook group was live, she said, it took off. Hundreds of members joined within the first hour. Then people began sharing videos -- including the one showing people chanting ""stop the count"" in Detroit -- and photographs, which were quickly shared to other Facebook pages and groups. ""It was like lightning in a bottle,"" Ms. Kremer said. ""The group grew so fast we were struggling to keep up with the people trying to post."" Many of the posts shared anecdotal stories claiming voter fraud or intimidation against Mr. Trump's supporters. One post asserted that poll workers counting the ballots were wearing masks with the Biden campaign's logo, while another said that Mr. Trump's supporters were purposefully given faulty ballots that could not be read by machines. Many of these posts, images and videos have been proved false. Some of the photos and images were edited or otherwise manipulated to back the idea of election tampering. Facebook has removed or labeled some of those posts, though new ones are appearing faster than the company's fact-checkers can take action on.

Others posted about violence. One member of the Facebook group wrote on Wednesday, ""This is going to take more than talk to fix."" Underneath that post, another member responded with emojis of explosions. On Thursday morning, the Stop the Steal Facebook group's growth skyrocketed further, according to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media analytics tool. That was when right-wing figures such as Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist, and Amy Kremer, Ms. Kremer's mother and a founder of a group called Women for Trump, began posting about the Facebook group on Twitter. Ali Alexander, a political operative who previously went by the name Ali Akbar, also tweeted dozens of times about the Stop the Steal movement to his 140,000 Twitter followers. Their messages, which were shared thousands of times, were a rallying cry for people to join the Stop the Steal Facebook group and take action in local protests against voter fraud. ""In just it's first couple hours, more than 100,000 people joined the Women for America First, Stop the Steal Facebook Group,"" wrote Mr. Posobiec. In comments below his post, many people cheered the Facebook group's popularity. The tweets helped send more people to Stop the Steal. Interactions with the Facebook group soared to 36 posts a minute on Thursday morning, up from roughly one post a minute, according to CrowdTangle data. Mr. Posobiec, Mr. Alexander and Amy Kremer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. At Facebook, executives were notified of the group by Facebook moderators as they began flagging posts for potential calls for violence and protests to disrupt the vote. The company also received calls from journalists about the group and its explosive growth. By midmorning, executives were discussing whether they should remove Stop the Steal, said one employee involved in the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly.

Facebook took down the group on Thursday at 2 p.m. Eastern. Ms. Kremer said that she was angry that Facebook had removed her group and that she was in discussions with the company to reinstate it. She accused Facebook, along with other social media companies, of censoring the Stop the Steal movement. ""Facebook had other options,"" she said. ""They were flagging our posts and we could have worked with them. But this is what they do, they censor."" Still, Ms. Kremer said that before the group was taken down, its members had successfully organized events in dozens of cities. She has set up another website about voter fraud and was now directing people to it, she said. On Facebook, dozens of new Stop the Steal groups have been created since the company removed Ms. Kremer's group. One had nearly 10,000 members. Another had just over 2,000."

This is not a dig at the prosecution. As on Wednesday, when they spent eight hours constructing a detailed blueprint of Mr. Trump's misbehavior, the managers threw themselves -- with gusto -- into explaining the constitutional ins and outs of impeachment. And just as before, they came equipped with slides, photos and video clips. They even brought instructional materials for the senators.

Their preparedness is impressive. Even Representative Matt Gaetz, the devoted Trump cheerleader from Florida, observed earlier this week that, thus far, the Democrats' presentation looked as though it was ""cable news"" while the president's defense team's looked like ""an eighth-grade book report.""

That said, while Wednesday's narrative of presidential scheming and obstruction was a nonstop pile-on of damning testimony and other hard evidence, Thursday's argument began with a lengthy seminar by one of the House managers, Representative Jerry Nadler, on the framers' intent regarding impeachment."

The idea for ""The Other Einstein"" (2016), about Mileva Maric, the Serbian mathematician and physicist who was Albert Einstein's first wife, came to her while she was reading a children's biography of Einstein with one of her sons. The book dispensed with Maric in a couple of sentences.

""I started thinking: Here's this woman who made this incredible ascent from the backwater of Eastern Europe, where it was actually illegal for girls to attend high school, to become one of the very first women at a university physics program in Europe,"" Benedict says. ""Why had I never heard of this woman? She and Einstein had the same physics education, and they were married during his most prolific period -- 1905. I couldn't help but wonder what role she might have played in his theories."" (Debate over Maric's contributions continues, with some scholars arguing that she may have collaborated with Einstein or even co-authored some of his papers.)

Benedict's new novel, based on the life of the Hollywood film star and legendary beauty Hedy Lamarr, puts the conceit of the lone woman in a man's world once again on center stage. ""The Only Woman in the Room,"" which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 11, homes in not on Lamarr the movie star but on Lamarr the inventor (with the composer George Antheil) of a ""frequency-hopping"" radio communication technology that distantly prefigured wifi. ""Every day most of the people in the world stare at an invention that she had a hand in, and that's the cellphone,"" Benedict says. ""Once I knew that, I knew absolutely that I had to tell her particular story."""

Fox at the University of Pennsylvania in 2002, where she was a longtime professor of sociology.





Renee C. Fox, a leading scholar of medical sociology, a field she was instrumental in creating in an era when women had a difficult time being heard in academia, died on Sept. 23 at a hospice center in Philadelphia. She was 92. The cause was leukemia, according to an email sent to colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was an emerita professor of sociology. Professor Fox was among the first to use the principles and methods of sociology to examine medical care and training, and to shed light on the social contexts of health and illness. Her work was informed by her experience with polio as a teenager, and her extensive travels and research in Africa, Asia and Europe. Dr. Robert Klitzman, director of the master of bioethics program at Columbia University, said that when Professor Fox started her career in the 1950s, medical care was still seen through a strictly scientific lens, and that ethical, social and cultural issues were ignored.

""Her work, and that of others who followed her, has become ever more influential,"" he said by email, ""helping to create the field of bioethics and dramatically altering how doctors, patients, scholars, policymakers and others look at medical care, institutions and research, and patients' lives."" Professor Fox's book ""Experiment Perilous: Physicians and Patients Facing the Unknown,"" published in 1959, is considered a foundational work of medical sociology. For two different five-month periods she observed the metabolic research ward at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, looking not only at the doctors and their sometimes conflicting roles as both physicians and researchers, but also at the patients and how they viewed their situation and their treatments. It was observational scholarship at a very personal level. ""Experiment Perilous"" by Renee C. Fox, considered a foundational work of medical sociology. ""She's not a doctor exactly,"" a favorite patient would say when introducing her to others on the ward. ""She's not a patient exactly. But she falls somewhere in between."" Professor Fox examined the sociology around human organ transplants in two books written with Judith P. Swazey -- ""The Courage to Fail: A Social View of Organ Transplants and Dialysis"" (1974) and ""Spare Parts: Organ Replacement in American Society"" (1992). Transplants were in their infancy early in her career, but by the second book she had become concerned that doctors were harvesting organs too quickly and intruding on the traditional dying process. She called it ""an ignoble form of medically rationalized cannibalism"" in a 1993 interview in The Washington Post.

In one of her earliest and most influential essays, ""Training for Uncertainty"" (1957), Professor Fox took up a subject that she would revisit throughout her career, the idea that the more sophisticated medicine became, the more questions it raised. ""'Uncertainty' -- if there's something to be chiseled on my tombstone, that would be it,"" she told the Penn Arts & Sciences Alumni Newsletter in 2002. Renee Claire Fox was born on Feb. 15, 1928, in Manhattan. Her father, Fred, founded P.F. Fox & Co. Investment Securities, and her mother, Henrietta (Gold) Fox, encouraged her educational progress, although she herself had only a primary-school education. During the summer after her freshman year at Smith College, she began feeling ill, and her doctor diagnosed her symptoms as polio. She never forgot the date: Aug. 15, 1945, otherwise known as V-J Day, when Japan surrendered, ending World War II. ""From my bed in our apartment,"" she wrote, ""through the open windows, I could hear the jubilant crowds in the street."" Polio is highly contagious, and finding a hospital that would accept her took some doing. She was taken to Sydenham Hospital in Harlem, which served mostly Black patients. Her polio was severe, affecting her swallowing and breathing, which she could barely do by the time she was hospitalized. In her memoir, Professor Fox paid tribute to a Black nurse who got her through the first night. ""I do not know her name,"" she wrote. ""But I do know that I survived that night because she put her head beside mine on the pillow where I lay, and breathed every breath with me.""

After a monthslong hospitalization and extensive physical therapy, she was able to walk again and returned to Smith, earning a bachelor's degree in 1949. In 1954 she earned a Ph.D. in sociology at Radcliffe College, a woman's college before it merged with Harvard University; her doctoral thesis became the basis of ""Experiment Perilous."" Professor Fox initially received no teaching offers and took a research position at Columbia University before joining the faculty at Barnard College and teaching there for 12 years. She moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 1969 and taught there until she retired in 1998. Professor Fox's other books included ""Doctors Without Borders: Humanitarian Quests, Impossible Dreams of Medecins Sans Frontieres"" (2014), ""The Sociology of Medicine: A Participant Observer's View"" (1989) and an essay collection, ""Explorations of a Mind-Traveling Sociologist,"" published in November."

A few years ago, I interrupted a panel discussion at the Guggenheim as it moved toward the dead-horse question of whether painting was still viable. How, I asked, uninvited, from the audience, could people talk of the end of painting when so many women were just beginning to paint? With hindsight I should have added that we were also still learning about the female painters of the past whose newly recovered works could very well influence the medium. History had in a sense not yet happened to their achievements. Hindsight arrived one or two years later, when a largely unknown sector of that past was emphatically, unforgettably heard from -- at the Guggenheim. This divine noise was the full-rotunda exhibition of the paintings of Hilma af Klint, which drew thousands of visitors and irrevocably altered the understanding of the genesis of abstract painting in the West. It was one of the most revelatory shows of many people's lifetimes, my own included. A similar jolt -- if not of that magnitude -- can now be felt in ""Agnes Pelton: Desert Transcendentalist,"" an exhibition at the Whitney Museum that is still plenty inspiring and thought-provoking. (The museum announced late Thursday that it was temporarily closing over concerns about the coronavirus.) This career-spanning survey of 45 paintings presents the underappreciated but inimitable art of the American painter Agnes Pelton (1881-1961) and offers a reminder that the history of modernist abstraction and women's contribution to it is still being written.

Pelton's exquisitely finished, otherworldly abstractions are full of mysterious shapes and distant horizons, glowing vessels, flowers, several kinds of stars and other celestial events. They are the stuff of dreams, visions and mirages; they often came to the artist while she slept or meditated and they arrived remarkably whole, as indicated by the sketches from her journal reproduced in the catalog, which originated, with the show, at the Phoenix Art Museum. (It was organized by Gilbert Vicario, chief curator there, and overseen at the Whitney by Barbara Haskell, with Sarah Humphreville.) There is nothing quite like Pelton's paintings in 20th-century American art. It is not just their much-admired spirituality that distinguishes them -- their blend of theosophy, Buddhism, astrology and the occult was not unusual among artists of the moment. It is rather the insouciant ease with which her images navigate between high and low, making that spirituality widely available, if not irresistible.

Precedents don't easily come to mind in front of Pelton's levitating motifs, subtle colors, effusions of light and the clear transparent space within which everything unfolds. Occasionally a stripped-down, pristine landscape evokes Dali, as in the 1940 work, ""Return,"" a desert oasis with its single palm tree (although look up in the sky and you'll see a scattering of faint stars, one being delivered by a large, nearly invisible dove). The California desert harbored the ""abstract beauty of the inner vision, which would be kindled by the inspiration of these rare and solitary places,"" Pelton wrote in 1932, while applying for a Guggenheim grant.

The artist my mind defaults to is Walt Disney, in particular the Disney of ""Fantasia,"" which was in the works by the late 1930s. By then Pelton had been firmly in control of her arsenal of stars, vessels and horizons for several years. Implicit in many of Pelton's best works is a Disneyesque sense of magical, inherently musical animation, subtly comedic wit and even jubilation. Consider the motion -- and speeds -- visible in ""Orbits"" (1934) where seven stars zip about, each on its own pastel lariat, while a black vessel-like shape swells majestically behind them, rising over a low triangle of mountain, on what can only be described as a rippling magic carpet. The vessel culminates in curved lavender shapes that create a turban effect and a scalloped cloud that conjures a doily. This is a lot of activity for a not-very-large painting, yet we experience the details individually as they coalesce in the dawning sky. The tension of unity in formation is the template of Pelton's best work.

Her mother was a musician, her father a well-off, seemingly hedonistic expat, who died, possibly of a morphine overdose, when Pelton was 9. By then, her mother had returned to the States with her daughter and settled in Brooklyn; she opened a music school that helped support them. Pelton would live with her mother until the older woman died in 1920. Pelton belonged to the first generation of American Modernists, which included Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley and Arthur Dove -- but not to their circle, which revolved around the advocacy and galleries of the impresario Alfred Stieglitz.

Pelton and O'Keeffe, who was six years younger, had a surprising amount in common: Both studied with Arthur Wesley Dow (Pelton at the Pratt Institute; O'Keeffe at Columbia), who encouraged their interest in landscape non-Western art and thought. Both were affected by Kandinsky's treatise ""On the Spiritual in Art"" and both were invited to visit Taos and Santa Fe by the saloniste and patron Mabel Dodge Luhan. (Pelton went first in 1919, for four months.) Each was profoundly changed by the desert, finding it to be her natural habitat. But the two had emerged from unsteady childhoods with markedly different temperaments. While O'Keeffe triumphed over hers by force of personality, Pelton was rendered forever fragile and introverted. In the 1910s, Pelton made her way to New York and into the 1913 Armory Show. She, exhibited two works from the sometimes treacly series ""Imaginative Portraits,"" similar to the one that opens the Whitney show. With the Whistlerian title ""Room Decoration in Purple and Gray,"" it offers an Annunciation-like scene of a solitary virginal maid communing with a golden bird surrounded by irises on vines. It is not promising, except for the background, a luminous void framed by soft shifting layers that became essential to her distinctive personal style."

DAD'S MAYBE BOOK 

By Tim O'Brien 

Read by the author

 Tim O'Brien came to fatherhood late. He was 56 in June 2003 when his first son, Timmy, was born. His second son, Tad, showed up two years later. He hadn't been sure he wanted to have kids; his wife, Meredith, had been ardently for it, and the conflict had nearly caused a breakup. But O'Brien -- who brilliantly captured the terrors of war in works of fictions like ""The Things They Carried"" and ""Going After Cacciato,"" for which he won the National Book Award -- is not a half-measures kind of guy. Once he committed to fatherhood, he found himself besotted, obsessed, joyous ... and terrified. A writer who has spent much of his career pondering death could see that, even for a man in his 50s, ""the mathematics of mortality were already forbidding,"" and the very real possibility that he would leave young sons behind weighed on him. So in 2004, with his second son on the way, he started to write letters to the boys, ""to give Timmy and Tad what I have often wished my own father had given me -- some scraps of paper signed 'Love, Dad.'"" As his own father, alcoholic and inconstant, had been ""a mystery to me,"" he says, he decided to introduce his sons to their father, ""a man they might never really encounter.""

He wrote many such letters, off and on, in the ensuing years, jotting down everything from life tips to meditations on Hemingway, whose work he sees as ""a window through which they might glimpse the things that have preoccupied me for more than 50 years -- making sentences, making stories."" He expresses his tremendous pride in their accomplishments, like learning to ride a unicycle and rapidly solving a Rubik's Cube; as well as his love of magic and his fascination with the battles of Lexington and Concord, in which he sees parallels to his own experiences in Vietnam.

A decade into the project, Tad and Meredith suggested he compile the letters into a book. But, in Meredith's words, not a book book, ""just a maybe book. What you've written about fatherhood might mean something to other parents."" And their children, Tad chimed in. You might expect such a book -- and its corresponding audiobook, read by O'Brien himself -- cobbled together from scraps of pride and dread, to be something of a mess: scattershot, sentimental, even sappy. The ideal audience, as I figured when I accepted the assignment to review this audiobook, would be a similarly love-drunk father, a fellow sap. In other words, me. It grabbed me, despite its cobbled-together defects. O'Brien finds more of the secrets of life in Hemingway than I do, and even I, when confronted with his most overweening examples of parental joy (no matter how self-effacing the delivery), had to shake my head. Yet O'Brien's narration is gentle and genuine. As the reader of his audiobook, he's not an actor; he's simply a dad, talking to you. In one chapter, he worries that Timmy's imagination might be a little too well developed and commanding; the boys' love of ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" led them to wear tails everywhere, and the parents, too, find themselves trailing strips of cloth pinned to their clothes. He tries to talk Timmy out of the charade by telling him a bedtime story about a boy who does too much pretending. Does Timmy know what pretending is? The boy answers: ""I guess it's like when you go away on trips. Sometimes I dream about you. I dream about how you'll come home from the airport and bring me surprises and play with me. I get sad when you go away, and so I pretend you're not gone. Is that bad?"" O'Brien responds that it isn't, and as you might imagine, the tails stay. Reading that passage, O'Brien's voice catches; and, as a father who also might have traveled too much for his kids' happiness, I wasn't breathing steadily for a while either.

So is this a book? Maybe. Actually, it's at least three. There are the eclectic letters, but also a long essay on writing that is insightful, if shoehorned in. And finally there is the war memoir: recounting his years as a soldier, and the lasting burdens of deployment and writing about it (he never expected to meet young men who'd read his books or attended his talks, and then decided to enlist). Woven throughout are lengthy reflections on fathers and sons, and always the return to that final subject, death. ""I'm struck by a mix of wonderment and awe at my proximity to life's close,"" he says toward the end, now in his 70s. Ultimately, it is a book about those boys and his unbounded love for them. He tells a long story about a talk he gave at the Sewanee Writers' Conference when Timmy was just a year old. In a lecture, he soberly stated that his son had just spoken his first words, and they were, ""'Tis a tale told by an idiot."" It was a confection, T. Berry Brazelton meets magical realism. But it upset a middle-aged man, who cornered him afterward. ""Your [expletive] kid,"" he announced, ""never quoted Shakespeare."" O'Brien replied that it was merely a story, and that fiction writers ""lie for money."" Their extended and entertaining argument ended with the man's egregious accusation: ""Your son has a terrible, terrible father."" Mister literalist, you are so wrong."

The professors had no idea if students would even come. It wasn't mandatory, they wouldn't get credit and it was taking place at night. Friday night. So no one was more surprised than Kara Wittman and Joanne Nucho when 24 people showed up for their ""Essay as Resistance"" class, which had its debut at Pomona College in March 2017 and ran for three 90-minute sessions. ""We were shocked that it was so popular,"" said Ms. Wittman, an assistant professor of English at Pomona, in Claremont, Calif., who taught the class with Ms. Nucho, an assistant professor of anthropology there. But that's exactly the appeal of the so-called pop-up class, an experiential, interdisciplinary, extracurricular workshop that appears briefly and usually vanishes.

""It was a time when our community on campus and nationally was divided around issues of race, and we wanted to give our students the opportunity to discuss some of these challenging topics,"" said Kimoi Seale, assistant dean of students, who taught the ""White Privilege"" class. Pop-ups have appeared in various incarnations for a while, but are often traced to Stanford University's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, commonly called the D.school, for seasoned instructors to try out new course content. More recently, the D.school's University Innovation Fellows program began to use pop-ups as tools for students to be more engaged in their own learning environments. The D.school's pop-ups have since become ""Pop Outs,"" which have a narrower focus. Timothy Moore, 25, was a University Innovation fellow in 2015. After being introduced to the idea of pop-ups, he brought the concept back to James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., from which he graduated that year. The university's X-Lab has since held pop-ups in everything from building ukuleles to ice-cream making using liquid nitrogen.

""A lot of teachers don't realize that the pop-up will make their curriculum stronger,"" said Mr. Moore, who now works at Claremont College's Hive, a program at the school that brings students together across disciplines to practice human-centered approached to real-world problems. ""They're a low-risk way to try out a class."" The beauty of the pop-up is that anything goes. Some classes last a few weeks; others run for a day or weekend. Some are faculty led; others are taught by students, administrators or even local businesspeople. Some are for credit; others are strictly for fun -- or, at least, personal enlightenment. And sometimes the classes are so popular that they return as full-fledged, for-credit courses, which is what happened with the ""Essay as Resistance"" class. ""Our goal here is to enhance the creative capacity of our students and teach them to navigate ambiguity, and to foster experimental learning,"" said Fred Leichter, founding director of the Hive, officially the Rick and Susan Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity. ""The pop-ups are designed as a way to offer things that are often mash-ups between different disciplines. To me it's one of the purest forms of learning. Both parties are there to create something together."" Here is a look at some pop-ups at schools around country. When fires ravaged Southern California last summer and major flooding followed soon after, Char Miller took notice. Mr. Miller, director of environmental analysis at Pomona College, has been teaching about fire for over two decades. ""But the particular dynamic between fires and flood, which was so horrifying this winter -- we have this incredible opportunity to show students on the ground what that actually means,"" he said. ""It's a way for students to understand that they live in a particular place and that the natural systems here function differently than from wherever they come."" To be taught this fall by Mr. Miller and Jeff Groves, an English professor at Harvey Mudd College.

The next subject, in a class running this month and next: eviction. ""Most of the people who get evicted don't take any steps to fight their notices in court. That means there's more eviction notices because it's easier for landlords to use the court system without opposition,"" she said. ""If we can inform people of their rights in responding to an eviction notice, we might get more protection to them. To use the process. So the class is a lab -- where my students, legal aid and the court -- help them think through what interventions they can send out to encourage people to take action."" Antonia Messuri, the assistant dean for academics at St. Michael's in Colchester, Vt., regularly counsels students who are stuck in their lives. ""Often our students are coming from a place of being told what to do, how to do it and when it's due their whole lives,"" she said. This class, which runs through April, ""is an opportunity for them to say, 'This is my life, my education.' "" Students will read articles on self-determination and Buddhist writings, with a focus on meditation, resilience and grit. The bulk of the pop-ups at James Madison are designed to be a mix of science and technology. In this class, on April 20, students learn the basic rules for safe flying, practice flight controls and then test their skills by flying through something they can relate to: a Quidditch course. ""It's designed to expose them to lightweight drones and the opportunity to take the full drone class where they learn how to use drones to solve real-world problems,"" said Nick Swayne, founding director of the university's X-Lab. ""We will also have small model rockets available for students to try. These rockets are used extensively by our geology department to increase student interest in atmospheric studies."" 'After Parkland: Gun Culture, Gun Violence and the Shifting Politics of Gun Control,"" Bennington College Since the spring of 2015, Bennington College in Bennington, Vt., has been offering pop-up courses. In this course, taught by State Senator Brian Campion, who is also the director of public policy programs in the Center for the Advancement of Public Action, students will explore gun culture, gun policy, the continuing work of policymakers at the state's Capitol, and whether or not such actions are likely to be the most effective to keep citizens safe. The course, which runs through April, will bring in guests with different perspectives."

If you're not familiar with it, you're not alone. Plenty of otherwise savvy tax professionals and financial planners don't know much about it, either. It's called the Coverdell Education Savings Account, and there is nothing else like it. The Coverdell lets people put away up to $2,000 each year in an investment account. While the contributions are not tax-deductible, you don't pay any taxes on the earnings you take out as long as you use them for tuition or other qualified expenses, including those for elementary or secondary education. Even with that annual contribution limit, the tax savings can add up to thousands of dollars for people who are persistent savers. Now, however, the question is whether this quirk will last. As with a lot of things in the tax code, the Coverdell tax break for elementary and secondary tuition costs is scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, absent some legislative action in Washington.

Whether you want to root for its continued existence may depend on your political outlook. The years of debate over whether this tax break should have come into existence in the first place featured some of the most colorful political rhetoric in recent history. The late Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican of Georgia, for whom the accounts were eventually named, locked horns with President Bill Clinton in 1997 over Mr. Clinton's threat to veto the senator's effort to create accounts that would give tax breaks to parents who steer their children away from public schools. Senator Coverdell said the threat, which the president later made good on, was ""almost a Pearl Harbor for education reform."" Why was the president so opposed? Cue the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who said in 1998 that he believed that an account like the one that Senator Coverdell had proposed ""hangs the sign for all to see on the front door of public schools of America, 'Abandon hope all ye who enter here. Get out while you can.' "" More on U.S. Schools and Education

While the pandemic has created an urgent search for teachers in some areas, not every district is suffering from shortages. Here are the factors in play Newt Gingrich, then the speaker of the House, had seen the accounts much differently one year earlier, speaking of ""parents and children who want the right not to be destroyed by bad schools."" He and Senator Coverdell finally got their way in 2001, when President George W. Bush signed a bill allowing holders of what became known as Coverdell accounts to use the earnings for kindergarten through 12th grade education, albeit with a $2,000 annual contribution cap. ""In terms of a financial benefit, you're talking de minimis,"" Joe McTighe, executive director of the Council for American Private Education, said this week. ""But in terms of its historical importance, it carried a lot of weight. As far as I know, it's the first federal tax relief specifically helping parents with kids in religious or independent elementary and secondary schools.""

Despite the Coverdell's status as a sort of totem of school choice advocates, no one has figured out just how many people are using the accounts to pay for a primary or secondary school education today. The Internal Revenue Service does not know, and neither do the big brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and Merrill Lynch that offer Coverdells. What we do know is that overall use of Coverdells, which people can also use to save for college, has been falling quickly, declining from 985,000 tax returns mentioning contributions to Coverdells in 2005 to 644,000 in 2009, according to a brief released this week by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The committee said the decline was probably because of the low Coverdell contribution limits compared with other tax-advantaged ways of saving for college, like 529 accounts. That said, it's possible that many more people would be in on the Coverdells if they knew about the tax breaks for parents with children in private or religious schools.

Here's how those tax savings break down, according to Jason Derbyshire, business development manager for the company that makes TradeLog accounting software for active traders and investors. If parents saved $2,000 for each of 16 years in a normal brokerage account, earned returns of 6 percent for each year (a realistic return for someone in a mix of stock and bond index mutual funds who rebalances annually) and then pulled the entire balance out in the summer of the 17th year, they'd end up with $54,425.76. Those 16 annual $2,000 contributions mean their cost basis for capital-gains tax calculation purposes would be $32,000, leaving them with a $22,425.76 capital gain. In a normal taxable brokerage account, the long-term capital gains tax would be 15 percent of that gain for most parents, or $3,363.86. In a Coverdell, however, the account holder pays no taxes as long as the money is used for a qualified education expense. And every little bit helps when facing down an annual bill for, say, $51,025 for boarding students at the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, N.J., or over $25,000 for many private day schools around the country. The tax savings would be higher if the account earned more than 6 percent, if capital gains tax rates increased or if the account owners let it grow longer than 17 years by changing the beneficiary of the Coverdell from the oldest child to the youngest one.

And lest you think that Coverdells are merely a plaything for the private school parent, Christopher E. Condeluci, a lawyer at Venable in Washington and a former tax and benefits counsel for the Senate Finance Committee, points out that parents of children in public schools can use the accounts in several ways, too. The Internal Revenue Service Coverdell rule book notes one nearly universal possibility: using account distributions for computers and Internet access. Then, there are the more complicated tax maneuvers that some people have tried in order to use a Coverdell. The rules prohibit contributions from people who have modified adjusted gross income of more than $110,000 for singles and $220,000 for couples filing a joint return. But the regulations did not specifically prohibit wealthier parents from giving gifts to their minor children to open their own accounts, and the I.R.S. does repeatedly point to beneficiaries' ability to make contributions on their own behalf. People wealthy enough to consider this kind of fancy footwork probably ought to pay an experienced tax accountant to review it. If you're new to this Coverdell private and religious school angle, you may well wonder why you'd want to bother opening an account now because of the uncertainty around the tax rules come Dec. 31, 2012. One potential reason is that Representative Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican from New York, has introduced legislation with Representative Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, proposing to raise the annual contribution limit to $10,000. The odds are probably long here given the continuing federal deficit troubles. ""I don't see how they can afford something like that these days,"" said Joe Hurley, founder of the savingforcollege.com Web site. At the opposite extreme, legislators may allow the tax-free savings for kindergarten through 12th grade education to expire at the end of 2012 and let the annual contribution cap for higher education savings fall to $500 to pay for higher priority tax breaks. Then again, Coverdells probably aren't costing much now in the broad scheme of things. In 2010, the Joint Committee on Taxation predicted that the tax breaks this year would deprive the United States Treasury of just $17 million. Robert Enlow, president of the Foundation for Educational Choice, doesn't see the Coverdell break going away. He points to the many pieces of legislation that states have passed in support of vouchers or other means of allowing parents more control of where their children go to school as evidence that the political winds are at the back of those who want to keep using Coverdells for public and secondary school tuition. ""People are tired of ZIP code assignment in public schools, and that's a bipartisan desire,"" he said. ""The current system is seen as having such an unfair impact on low-income families, and things like Coverdells, vouchers and tax credits really are being seen as ways to shake the system up a little more."" If he's wrong, however, it's no great loss for Coverdell account holders. Even if they lose the ability to use their tax-free earnings for elementary or secondary school costs, there's always college, and they could keep contributing toward that goal if they wished. With tuition continuing to rise to levels that boggle the mind, parents across a range of income levels will need all the tax breaks they can get."

An attempt by his bank, TSB, to shift data to a new computer system had gone spectacularly wrong. For several maddening days, he could not connect to his account, transfer funds or reach anybody at the bank for help. ""I felt abandoned,"" said Mr. Stevenson, a 31-year-old software developer. ""I needed to be moving money around, and I needed access to my bank."" The systems failure in April, affecting nearly two million TSB customers, was a breaking point for Mr. Stevenson. He moved his money to Monzo, a British start-up that is among a growing number in Europe offering checking accounts and A.T.M. cards, but lack physical branches -- everything is done through an app. So-called fintech companies have sought to take on the world's biggest banks for years, but only recently have companies like Monzo begun to build a critical mass. Millions of customers across Europe, most in their 20s or 30s, have signed up over the past two years. And thanks to favorable regulations in the region and an influx of venture capital, that shift is accelerating.

Here in Britain, officials have been concerned about the power of large banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and they see the start-ups as weakening the hold of traditional lenders. The authorities have adopted policies such as a ""regulatory sandbox,"" allowing what are known as challenger banks to test new financial products and get feedback from regulators before proposing them to customers. In contrast, while some policymakers in the United States are trying to make it easier to open new banks, progress has been slow. States do not want to cede oversight, and without a license, American financial start-ups must set up partnerships with traditional banks to hold deposits. Support from regulators in Europe has given momentum to companies entering the market there. In addition to making slicker apps, the companies have slashed fees for spending overseas and wiring money. Last year, Monzo became one of the first challenger banks to receive a license allowing it to hold customers' deposits on its own, a milestone no start-up in the United States has achieved. ""Our regulator is pretty forward thinking,"" said Tom Blomfield, 33, the co-founder and chief executive of Monzo, referring to Britain.

But Mr. Blomfield -- who sat for an interview at his London apartment after walking the office dog, a cockapoo named Bingo -- argues that day-to-day retail banking has been relatively unaffected. Monzo, like other start-up banks, still has to figure out how to be profitable. But it has already begun to reimagine banking for an increasingly cashless society. Customers of the future won't need branches when they can text a customer service representative. Detailed spending breakdowns help account holders control their spending. Doing without retail space and tellers keeps costs down, allowing the company to reduce fees and hire programmers. ""The internet lets you run these traditional businesses at a fraction of the cost,"" Mr. Blomfield said. The company sends celebratory GIFs on Twitter to new customers, and offers a bright coral-color A.T.M. card that is Instagram-ready. Users can visit the office to see what's being worked on, test new features and perhaps even pet Bingo. Or they can view the company's product road map, published online.

 Monzo got started with crowdfunding and remains a minnow compared with the giants of British banking, but customers -- notably younger, wealthier ones -- are signing up. Roughly 75 percent of Monzo's 900,000 clients are under 40, split evenly between men and women. On average, they make more than 50,000 pounds, or about $65,000, a year, nearly double the median British salary, and Monzo is adding more than 2,000 customers a day. Digital banks face innumerable issues, though. Chief among them is how they will make money. A slick app and basic checking accounts are unlikely to be enough, unless they can offer services like mortgages and other loans that come with higher interest rates.

Last year, Monzo's losses quadrupled to PS33.1 million. The company is developing a marketplace where customers can shop for financial services offered by other firms, with Monzo collecting a fee. In the meantime, it makes some money from overdraft and A.T.M. charges, and is experimenting with giving out short-term loans of up to PS1,000. As they expand, these start-ups will also face more regulatory scrutiny and targeting by fraudsters. Traditional banks must ensure, for example, that a certain proportion of the deposits they hold are kept in reserve, as a safety net. Such policies help guarantee that a bank will not lose its customers' money, but they make it harder to turn a profit. Now that Monzo holds customer deposits, it must also meet these requirements.

Start-ups also have to fight inertia. People rarely change banks, whether because of an existing mortgage or the headache of updating a Netflix account. Less than a quarter of Monzo's customers deposit their paychecks into their accounts; most use it as an add-on, to take advantage of perks like cheaper foreign exchange transactions. Even Mr. Stevenson, who does his day-to-day banking with Monzo, had to go to another local lender to refinance. ""The big question is, will millions of people switch their primary transaction accounts, where their checks get deposited and where they pay their bills, and do their key transactions,"" said Hans Morris, a former executive at Citigroup and Visa who now manages Nyca, a New York venture capital fund. ""If you're making a historical bet, you would say that they aren't going to switch."" At the same time, traditional banks are adapting. JPMorgan is testing a mobile-focused banking service called Finn, which offers savings and budgeting tools similar to those of Monzo. Goldman Sachs has introduced Marcus, an online savings and lending product that has more than 1.5 million customers. Mr. Blomfield is confident his company's young customer base will eventually turn to Monzo for other, more lucrative, financial services that it intends to eventually offer.

Monzo plans to announce in coming weeks that it is raising about PS100 million, at a valuation of more than PS1 billion, according to two people familiar with the deal. The deal will make it one of the biggest start-ups in Europe, and Monzo will use the funds to help enter the United States as early as next year. Revolut, another banking start-up, has more than 2.75 million customers across Europe, and it is adding 7,000 each day. After raising $250 million in April, it, too, wants to offer services in the United States. Government policies there are more constraining, however. As a result, most fintech firms in the United States have focused on payment services like Square, and mobile money transfers like Venmo, though companies including Chime have entered partnerships with licensed lenders to offer banking accounts more like Monzo. Still, investors in Europe have been won over. A record $1.2 billion has been pumped into banking start-ups globally so far this year, 70 percent of which has gone to European companies. That is more than double last year's figure, and a tenfold increase on the amount invested in 2014, according to CB Insights, a market research firm. Martin Mignot, a partner at Index Ventures and a member of Revolut's board of directors, said TSB's systems failure this year encapsulated the issues traditional banks face: costly retail space and slow, legacy computer systems. Revolut and others are more nimble than their older, larger competitors. ""It's a different mind-set,"" he said. Even some who once felt that app-based banks were a gimmick have been won over. ""I was a bit skeptical, but I'm definitely a convert,"" said Sinead Loftus, a legal assistant in Ireland who joined Revolut after growing frustrated with her local bank's fees. ""I've convinced my mom to get one, I told all my co-workers to get one, I got my boss one."""

He helped give the West Indies team the most intimidating batting lineup in world cricket.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/12/obituaries/12Weekes-obit1/09Weekes-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=17e6684b7f2c13f8220e51d90aacfc66409387ae5d5c075bc57dd7a6c37b60a8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/sports/cricket/everton-weekes-dead.html,d99398ab-25bb-5bac-a694-3bcd31d372f2.jpg,"Along with his fellow Barbados batsmen Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott -- together they were ""the three Ws"" -- he broke the sport's longstanding color barrier.

The West Indies cricketer Everton Weekes was the last of the ""three Ws"" -- batsmen linked by a matchless conjunction of birth, location and alliteration. Weekes, Frank Worrell and Clyde Walcott were born within 17 months and two miles of one another in Bridgetown, Barbados, which in 1925, the year Weekes was born, had a population of 13,486. Walcott believed that the three had been delivered by the same midwife. For a decade, beginning in the late 1940s, the trio gave the West Indies team the most intimidating batting lineup in world cricket. Each man was right-handed, each would be knighted for services to the game, and each was Black. Everton Weekes died on July 1 in Christ Church, Barbados. He was 95 and the last surviving W. Worrell died in 1967 at 42; Walcott in 2006 at 80.

The Barbados Cricket Association announced Weekes's death. No cause was specified, but he had been in poor health since having a heart attack last year. The West Indies cricket broadcaster Tony Cozier wrote of the three Ws in 2015 that ""in the fading days of British colonialism, all three broke the longstanding racial barrier of a sport always held as a badge of excellence by the islands of the cricketing Caribbean."" Worrell was cricket's nearest equivalent to Jackie Robinson. His appointment in 1960 as the first regular Black captain of the West Indies team ended the monopoly of the region's white plantocracy. Walcott became, in 1993, the first chairman of the International Cricket Council, the sport's governing body, who was not from England. Everton Weekes, who had the poorest background of the three, was born on Feb. 26, 1925, in the Pickwick Gap district of Bridgetown. He was named for his father's favorite English soccer team, the Everton Football Club of Liverpool. (The English cricketer Jim Laker once told Weekes, referring to Weekes's father, ""Just as well he didn't support West Bromwich Albion."") Everton was raised from the age of 8 by his mother after his father went to work in Trinidad.

He left St. Leonard's School at 14 and joined the army at 17. His early cricket education came from assisting the groundskeeper at Bridgetown's main cricket ground, Kensington Oval, but he could not join Pickwick, the club that played there, because it was all white. Instead he played for the army club Garrison, about two miles to the south. He broke into the Barbados team in 1945.

All three Ws played in the West Indies' first postwar series of test matches -- international contests played over five days -- against England in 1948. In style of play, the three were a study in contrasts: Worrell was fluidly elegant, Walcott was a fearsome power hitter, and the 5-foot-8 Weekes was compact and ruthlessly efficient. But they shared an ability to destroy the best bowling. The West Indies team in the 1950s lacked both the fast bowling and the leadership that would make it an all-conquering force in the 1970s and '80s. Yet the trio shared triumphs, like the team's first victory in England in 1950, prompting celebrations that heightened British awareness of what became known as the ""Windrush generation"" of postwar Caribbean immigrants. Judging both by statistics and by much informed opinion, Weekes was the best batsmen of the three. Batting average retains greater currency in cricket analysis than in its baseball equivalent, and Weekes's average of 58.61 runs per innings in test matches was better than Walcott's 56.68 and Worrell's 49.48. It is the fourth-highest of all time, and the best by a West Indian among completed careers of more than 50 innings in tests. In 1948, he became the only player in the 143-year history of test cricket to score 100 runs or more in five consecutive innings. Weekes played 48 times for the West Indies before a persistent thigh injury led to his early retirement from tests in 1958. He played for Barbados until 1964. He later served Barbados and West Indies cricket in coaching and administrative roles, and as a broadcaster. He toured Canada and the United States as a player with England's Marylebone Cricket Club in 1967, managed the Caribbean All-Stars team that visited New York in 1977, and coached Canada's team in the World Cup in 1979."

The mortgage document also lists the Pacific American Corporation, a New York subsidiary of HNA where Mr. Chen serves as a vice chairman and chief executive.

Graham Spearman, a senior sales executive with the Extell Marketing Group, said the buyer ""likes to be very high above the clouds,"" and was impressed by the unencumbered views of Central Park, the Hudson and East Rivers and several landmark buildings, as well as the amenities available from the Park Hyatt New York hotel at the base of the building.

Mr. Chen was also undoubtedly pleased with the proximity of his new place to the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, where he serves on the board of directors.

The runner-up last week, at $29,500,000, was a penthouse at 250 West Street, an 11-story former warehouse in TriBeCa, opposite Piers 25 and 26 at Hudson River Park, that was converted to condominiums by the Elad Group in 2011. Monthly carrying costs for the four-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath residence are $20,130, according to Raphael De Niro of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, who represented the sponsor in the sale. In addition to 5,718 square feet of interior space, the unit has a 4,298-square-foot wraparound terrace (landscaped and irrigated) with views of the Hudson. The apartment also has its own private entrance and lobby. The private terrace facing north, west and south features a deck and six-person Jacuzzi.

Mr. De Niro said that the purchaser, whose identity was shielded by the limited liability company 250 West Street, is a ""domestic buyer"" who paid all cash and planned to use the residence as a pied-a-terre."

58097,Suppliers of Milk Powder to China Are Issued Fines,Chinese parents have gone to great lengths to buy foreign-made infant milk powder.,"A customer shopped for milk formula in a supermarket Wednesday in Haikou, China.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/08/world/asia/08milk/08milk-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=01e3de17c73b1f9d4a0cd2ad0dac55f34041a368ea7dd76cbc376e8c5e46941a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/business/global/china-fines-milk-powder-suppliers-over-pricing.html,5d1015a3-ac71-5358-8969-713b52302194.jpg,"BEIJING -- The Chinese government has fined six companies that sell infant milk powder a total of $109 million for anticompetitive behavior and price fixing, the country's top economic planning agency said on Wednesday. It is the largest fine China has ever issued for violations of its antimonopoly law, according to Xinhua, the official state news agency. Five of the companies are foreign, and one is based in Hong Kong. They are Mead Johnson Nutrition of the United States; Dumex Baby Food, a subsidiary of Danone in France; Biostime International of Hong Kong; Royal FrieslandCampina of the Netherlands; the Fonterra Co-operative Group of New Zealand; and Abbott Laboratories of the United States, according to a statement from the National Development and Reform Commission, the Chinese economic planning agency. The statement said three other companies were exempt from the punishment because they ""cooperated with the government investigation, provided important evidence and actively took self-rectification measures.""

Those not subject to the action were Wyeth Nutrition, a subsidiary of Nestle of Switzerland; Zhejiang Beingmate Technology Industry and Trade Company, a Chinese company; and Meiji Holdings of Japan. The decision concluded an investigation that began in March into the infant formula industry for what the commission said was price fixing of baby formula in the Chinese market. The statement said evidence gathered during the course of the investigation showed that the companies used various methods to ensure that distributors raised prices, including signing contractual agreements, imposing fines, cutting rebates and restricting the supply of goods. People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, and at least one analyst of China's market for baby products have said that prices of foreign-branded infant milk powder had risen by at least 30 percent since 2008, when the Chinese began buying foreign brands in droves because of a wide scandal involving tainted Chinese-made milk powder that caused widespread illness and some deaths. After the investigation began, at least three foreign companies -- Mead Johnson, Dumex and Nestle -- cut their product prices about 20 percent in the Chinese market.

Mead Johnson was fined the equivalent of 4 percent of its 2012 revenue in China, or about $33 million. In its announcement, the agency said Mead Johnson did not actively cooperate with the investigation but was quick to take corrective measures. Mead Johnson said it did not intend to contest the agency's decision. A company spokeswoman said in an e-mail on Wednesday, ""We believe our business practices were consistent with prevailing interpretations of regulatory requirements applicable to our industry."" Biostime, which was fined 6 percent of its revenue from last year, or $26.6 million, received the harshest punishment of the six companies for its ""serious violations"" of the antimonopoly law. A statement by the company, released on Wednesday, said it intended to pay the fine and would continue to work to ensure that its ""various business decisions comply with the applicable P.R.C. laws and regulations,"" referring to the People's Republic of China. Dumex was fined $28 million, Abbott was fined $12.63 million and Friesland was penalized $7.89 million -- all representing about 3 percent of their 2012 revenue in China. The Chinese agency said they had cooperated with the investigation and had been quick to change their practices. Fonterra was fined only about $730,000, but it has been mired in a separate food safety scandal in China related to potentially tainted ingredients used in baby formula products made by other companies. This week, a top Fonterra executive flew to China to issue an apology at a news conference. Chinese officials have banned imports of New Zealand milk products and several foreign companies have said they would take precautions and recall products containing the Fonterra ingredients. The Chinese state-run news media has run front-page articles and harsh editorials over the case. Foreign brands have become popular since the Chinese milk industry experienced severe losses after the 2008 scandal, when six babies died and more than 300,000 children fell ill as a result of drinking milk products tainted with melamine, a toxic chemical."

That kind of chemistry emerges often in ""Western Stars,"" which Springsteen directed with Thom Zimny. Bruce performs the album's 13 songs (and one encore) with a band, an orchestra and a small audience all together in close quarters -- an old barn on the singer's property in New Jersey."

The return engagement marks the second time that the Polonsky's 299-seat main stage has hosted a play that originated at Soho Rep, following ""An Octoroon,"" Branden Jacobs-Jenkins's formally inventive comedy about race and American history, which ran at the Polonsky in 2015.

55591,An Upper West Side Apartment That Says 'Us',Maral Usefi and Neal Cimochowski knew their wish for outdoor space would limit their options. So be it.,"THE RENTERS

It wasn't really a need for a larger apartment that drove Maral Usefi and Neal Cimochowski from their 350-square-foot one-bedroom in the West 90s. Their $2,050 monthly rent was ""hard to give up,"" Ms. Usefi said. The cozy apartment had been hers for several years before she was joined there by her fiance, who had been living in Astoria. They wanted a place that was more theirs than hers -- and they craved some kind of outdoor space. They wanted to ""go outside without having to go to the park,"" Ms. Usefi said. She asked her agent, Leslie Lazarus of DJK Residential, whom she met through a friend, to hunt for a one-bedroom in their neighborhood. From the Upper West Side, it was a quick subway trip to Ms. Usefi's Midtown office, where she is an executive producer for Al Jazeera America, and an easy drive to Greenwich, Conn., where Mr. Cimochowski is a middle-school technology teacher. They also wanted a decent kitchen, and laundry in the building.

The couple, whose wedding is planned for July, knew their wish for outdoor space would narrow their options. ""You might have to give up interior size, or the finishes might not be as nice,"" Ms. Lazarus said. Still, plenty of small Upper West Side buildings had ground-level backyards or top-floor terraces. WEST 80s

A ground-floor apartment in a rowhouse had a garden, an item high on the wish list. But the kitchen wasn't for serious cooks. Ashok Sinha for The New York Times At $3,200 a month, a ground-floor apartment in the West 80s was a bit above their $3,000 budget, but had a nice outdoor garden reached through a large window. However, the kitchen fell short. It had an electric stove and and a convection microwave oven, ""kind of like those toaster ovens built in,"" Ms. Usefi said. ""It looks like a microwave but it does have a function for baking."" They decided to hold out for a gas stove and a regular oven. A fifth-floor walk-up in a small co-op building in the West 90s was for rent for $2,995 a month. The living room, bright and handsome, had a washer-dryer. ""That was a little weird, but it was behind a closet-type door so that was O.K.,"" Ms. Usefi said. The bathroom had only a shower, so small that ""Neal would have been squeezing his elbows together to fit."" A terrace was off the bedroom, which included a Murphy bed. The couple gave the place a pass.

Most of the apartments they saw weren't right. """"I felt guilty, almost,"" Ms. Usefi said. ""I would know within minutes and feel a little like I was wasting people's time."" WEST 90s

A one-bedroom in a fifth-floor walk-up had a terrace going for it. But the bedroom was tiny and the bathroom was tub-free. Ashok Sinha for The New York Times Mr. Cimochowski, who had a more flexible schedule, occasionally showed up for appointments on his own. At an apartment on West 86th Street, he was concerned about a hissing radiator. He didn't know ""if it's something that happened on and off and doesn't really get fixed, or something that you call and get fixed, and it's doing the same thing a week later and you end up living with it."" One day after work, Mr. Cimochowski went to see a ground-floor apartment with about 500 square feet in the West 70s. Ms. Lazarus had arranged for him to view the place before a scheduled open house, and he liked it instantly. Though the bedroom was small, he thought they should take the place. ""We should go with your instinct,"" Ms. Usefi told him. ""I don't want to risk losing a place you love."" The landlord was hesitant to rent the place if both weren't there to approve. With any possibility of disagreement, ""it is best to get everybody on the same page from the beginning,"" Ms. Lazarus said. When Ms. Usefi saw the apartment, she loved it, too. The kitchen had a gas stove, a proper oven and even a pot rack. A sliding door led to a large enclosed garden. The couple signed on, arriving earlier this spring. Their rent is $2,900 a month and they paid a broker fee of 15 percent of a year's rent, or $5,220. ""Leslie's fee was high but she was worth every penny,"" Ms. Usefi said.

The bedroom has just enough room for a bed and a night stand. ""When you're looking for something so specific as outdoor space, you have to let some other things go,"" Ms. Usefi said. ""We are going to live with the small bedroom because we love the outdoor space so much."" They also had to let go of their wish for an in-building laundry room. ""It's not great to have to walk to the laundromat, but you know the machines are going to work,"" Ms. Usefi said. (Their old building had two washers and two dryers, one or more of which was often broken.) Street parking for Mr. Cimochowski is more difficult than before. ""I'm still trying to find the right strategy,"" he said. He is honing his technique, and can now tell if the nearby Beacon Theater is hosting an event that draws a mature audience -- drivers of cars with Connecticut and New Jersey plates will be trawling for spots. The couple had fun cleaning the yard, which seems to them like their own secret garden. They weeded and sodded, built a pergola and planted a peony bush. A neighbor has a basketball hoop out back, but they haven't seen anybody using it. Another has an outdoor whirlpool bath, which they ascertained by using satellite view on Google maps. They haven't seen anybody using that, either. If it were his, Mr. Cimochowski said, ""I'd be out there all the time."""

Here's what to eat this week. Maybe go meatless on Monday with some mushroom shawarma, portobellos treated as lamb. There's plenty on the plate, but I might make Samin Nosrat's salad-e shirazi to go along with it.

60823,Goldman Inquiry Comes at Key Time for British Regulator,"The Financial Services Authority of Britain, under pressure to strengthen a reputation badly damaged in the financial crisis, has started its own inquiry of Goldman Sachs.",The offices of Goldman Sachs in London on Tuesday.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/04/21/business/21fsaspan-cnd/21fsaspan-cndb-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=331&w=600&s=c7e798d615851804f158f48a315f9c709ac460cb5d6a5b76f7ea60cdcd0e7d3a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/business/global/21fsa.html,e3cdf2f0-809e-5826-8d38-64a31af277ff.jpg,"LONDON -- Hector Sants, the chief of Britain's financial regulator, pledged last year to reverse his agency's reputation as a toothless tiger. He wanted to spread fear across the financial services industry by stepping up the aggressiveness of its inquiries and by pursuing more prominent fraud cases. His opportunity has arrived, and its name is Goldman Sachs. On Tuesday, his agency, the Financial Services Authority, started a formal investigation of Goldman Sachs. It said it was working closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed suit against Goldman last week claiming that the firm defrauded investors in a mortgage-related deal. The bank, which is based in New York but has large operations in London, reiterated its response to the S.E.C. suit by denying any wrongdoing. It issued a statement saying, ""We believe the S.E.C.'s charges are completely unfounded in law and fact and look forward to cooperating with the F.S.A."" The Goldman investigation comes at a pivotal time for the British regulator. The F.S.A.'s reputation, like its American counterpart's, was damaged badly by the financial crisis. The Conservative opposition party, which holds a slight lead in national polls, said it would dissolve the agency if it won the general elections in two weeks because of its mistakes ahead of and during the financial crisis.

The pressure to deliver results is heightened further because ABN Amro was one of the banks that lost money in the Goldman deal under scrutiny. The bank was acquired in 2007 by the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is now controlled by the British government after a series of bailouts. London has also attracted attention from around the world as the birthplace of many of the exotic mortgage-related investments, created by American and foreign banks alike, that set off the financial crisis. Even before the Goldman investigation, the F.S.A. had embarked on an unusually aggressive campaign involving dawn raids, arrests and large fines to crack down on insider trading and repair its reputation. ""The F.S.A. was looked upon as a huge bureaucracy, handing out huge discussion papers and starting huge procedures resulting in relatively small fines,"" said Rowan Bosworth-Davies, a fraud prevention consultant and a former fraud squad detective at New Scotland Yard. ""Now it's turning the other way,"" he said. ""There is a lot of public anger and political support to go after white-collar crime, and there is also the concern at the F.S.A. that it could be dissolved. They want to prove that they are tough crime fighters.""

When the F.S.A. was created as an independent agency in 1997, its focus was on regulating financial services firms rather than investigating white-collar crime. Fines were relatively small, and the regulator's officers were known for their friendly relationship with executives at banks they were supposed to watch. Hector Sants, chief executive officer for the Financial Services Authority, in Britain. But that started to change about three years ago when Mr. Sants, a former Credit Suisse banker, and Margaret Cole, who joined the agency from the law firm White & Case in 2005, decided to crack down on insider trading and market abuse. Since then Ms. Cole, the agency's head of enforcement, has more than doubled her staff and recruited more experienced lawyers. She has also worked more closely with law enforcement and with the Serious Organized Crime Agency, which is known for going after drug lords and those involved in human trafficking. The F.S.A. has increased fines to PS34.9 million ($53.2 million) from PS5.3 million ($8.1 million), and Ms. Cole increased her budget to PS66 million ($101 million) from PS38 million ($58 million). And she borrowed tactics from her American counterparts, like offering plea deals. In 2008, she started her ""credible deterrence strategy"" to go after ""criminals in suits masquerading as City professionals."" The F.S.A. would no longer shy away from filing criminal cases and would increasingly go after individuals rather than companies. ""We decided the biggest deterrent, especially for insider dealing offenses, would be the risk of going to jail,"" Tracey McDermott, the agency's head of wholesale enforcement, said in an interview Tuesday.

The changes are becoming more visible. At 5:30 a.m. on March 23, on a quiet, tree-lined street in Oxford, a handful of agents with the F.S.A. and the organized-crime agency arrived at the home of Julian Rifat, a trader at Moore Capital in London. Mr. Rifat, who turned 41 that day, was questioned and arrested on suspicion of insider trading. Before the day was over, Ms. Cole had sent 143 agents to 16 addresses across London and the south of England. In all, six people were questioned, including a Deutsche Bank employee. The arrested people were released on bail and the regulator has yet to file formal charges. Mr. Rifat's lawyer declined to comment. Some analysts said the regulator's new approach was not without risks. Prosecuting criminal cases is much harder than pursuing civil suits because for criminal matters the F.S.A. needs to prove that a defendant knowingly passed on insider information. ""If the F.S.A. takes these cases forward and then loses them, they would get a real rough ride in the public,"" said Philip Parish, a partner at the law firm Lovells in London. The F.S.A. is running out of time to repair its image. If the Conservative Party and its leader, David Cameron, win the election, they may abolish the agency on the ground that it failed to adequately regulate banks ahead of the financial crisis, and merge its main supervisory division with the Bank of England. By contrast, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the Labor Party leader who is running for re-election and who created the F.S.A. when he was chancellor of the exchequer, has said he would widen the agency's powers to allow it to ""quash"" bankers' contracts if they encourage reckless risk-taking."
11372,"'Sleepless' Revives London's Pandemic Musical Scene, if Only Just","Based on the hit 1993 hit film ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" the production is London's first fully staged indoor musical in months. Applause for that, at least.","The play, like the film, is unusual for keeping its romantically inclined leads apart until the very end.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/02/arts/02sleepless4/02sleepless4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=f2c59a27920b37f352eca8a923802e6cdd6daef5726715d1e3595cb2d00a8080&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/theater/sleepless-musical-london-review.html,3ad8577a-2b2b-5fa8-b7f8-8f0484e195d5.jpg,"""Sleepless: A Musical Romance,"" which opened on Tuesday at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theater, is more noteworthy for what it represents than for the show itself: London's first fully staged indoor musical since the coronavirus pandemic brought live performances to a halt back in March. Several musical revivals have since been performed in concert at alfresco locations around the city. The rare plays on offer have had either casts of one or, as with the sound installation ""Blindness"" at the Donmar, no live actors at all. But like it or not -- and ""Sleepless"" is fairly anodyne -- the show on view through Sept. 27 exists on a scale that seemed unimaginable even a month or two ago. And for that at least, three cheers.

It helps that the musical has as its source ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" the wildly successful 1993 screen comedy starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan that is unusual for keeping its romantically inclined leads apart until the very end. (This ""Sleepless,"" by the way, is not connected to a separate 2013 stage musical that had its premiere at the Pasadena Playhouse in California.)

The result builds into the plot a geographical separation that chimes with our socially distanced age: The show, like the film, spends two hours bringing the widowed Sam (Jay McGuiness) and the excitable Annie (Kimberley Walsh) together atop the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day, at which point they don't do much more than clasp hands as Morgan Large's attractive two-tiered turntable set whooshes them from view. Safety precautions are in place. The cast and crew are tested daily for the coronavirus, while audiences are required to wear masks, have their temperatures checked upon arrival and follow a one-way system through a building that has hand sanitizer in evidence at every turn. The theater itself, which is toward the outer reaches of northwestern London and well away from the still-shuttered West End, is putting less than one-third of its 1,300 seats on sale for each performance -- a revenue-limiting measure by producers who clearly decided that some paying public was better than no public at all.

The determination of all involved makes it especially disappointing that the director Morgan Young's production isn't more exciting, however likable its leads are. (Young and his two English stars collaborated this time last year on the West End premiere of the 1996 Broadway musical ""Big,"" another screen-to-stage transfer of a Tom Hanks film.) It's bracing to find a musical showcasing a new British composing team in Robert Scott and Brendan Cull amid a climate still defined this side of the Atlantic by Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose new musical, ""Cinderella,"" is among the many autumn openings that have been postponed. But too much of the score has a samey, easy-listening quality, with one song blurring into the next.

Annie's numbers exist largely to tell us that she's ""out of my mind"" or ""out of my head,"" as you might be, too, if you developed a sudden obsession with a man on the other side of the United States based only on a chance hearing one holiday season on the radio. As is true of the film, you feel for the decent if dull Walter (Daniel Casey), Annie's partner, who is blindsided by her gathering infatuation with a voice she needs to see made flesh. The depressive Seattle architect Sam, in turn, is upstaged in this telling by his matchmaking son, Jonah, the 10-year-old here played by a young vocal dynamo, Jobe Hart, another alumnus of the musical ""Big."" (Hart shares the role of Jonah with three other boys, in accordance with union requirements.)

Indeed, the closest ""Sleepless"" comes to a showstopper is a second-act duet, ""Now or Never,"" for Hart and the musical theater veteran Cory English as Sam's ebullient friend, Rob. The song comes with its own reprise: ""Shall we do it again, just from the key change?"" And they do. Michael Burdette's book takes its lead from the Oscar-nominated screenplay co-written by Nora Ephron, at times running certain references into the ground. It's fine to present Annie, a reporter for The Baltimore Sun, as a film buff with an abiding interest in the Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr film ""An Affair to Remember,"" to which the ""Sleepless"" film owes a debt. But it's unclear why Annie really needs to sing of her love for Grant -- just as it's hard to believe that so avid a film buff would debate the pronunciation of Kerr's last name. Then again, Annie is the sort who thinks that ""even the word exotic sounds exotic,"" so there's no telling where her conversations may lead. Both known for their work with pop groups, McGuiness and Walsh prove amiable team leaders in a show that can't help but feel like an also-ran. You leave ""Sleepless"" pleased that it happened, and restless for more and better theater to come."
30105,A Different Perspective on the Border,"In his memoir, ""The Line Becomes a River,"" Francisco Cantú argues that he needed to be a Border Patrol agent to understand immigration.","A United States Customs and Border Protection agent in his vehicle along the Mexican border near Brownsville, Tex.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/04/books/review/04DOWNES-01/merlin_124917665_eb9c7e93-3420-4578-ada0-d63cf36be64a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e3631cade80df37e3227c21de2b2a96c23e7965923d7742adcfe6b9daed91901&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/books/review/line-becomes-a-river-francisco-cantu.html,fcd1d1fb-6a64-5904-9954-83c6faea9ab6.jpg,"THE LINE BECOMES A RIVER 

Dispatches From the Border 

By Francisco Cantu 

250 pp. Riverhead Books. $26 ""I'm tired of reading about the border in books,"" Francisco Cantu says one Christmas Eve to his mother, who is trying to talk him out of joining the Border Patrol. ""I know it might be ugly, I know it might be dangerous, but I don't see any better way to truly understand the place."" She is dubious. She was a ranger at Guadalupe Mountains National Park, east of El Paso, and tells him there are a hundred other ways for the grandson of a Mexican immigrant to comprehend the border than joining a paramilitary bureaucracy. He is adamant: ""Maybe it's the desert, maybe it's the closeness of life and death, maybe it's the tension between the two cultures we carry inside us. Whatever it is, I'll never understand it unless I'm close to it."" So away he goes, down to America's most potent metaphor, its 2,000-mile partisan fault line. His mother recedes to the story's margins, returning now and then to prick his conscience, to tell him to mind his soul. ""The Line Becomes a River,"" Cantu's account of four years as a border cop in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, arrives at a dire moment. The national head is spinning with fever visions of brown-skinned alien rapists and beheaders and terror gangs, and of a mythical wall that the president says will protect ""us"" from ""them."" The very idea of an American ""us"" that includes the foreign-born seems lost to a distant time, to a less terrified country that some of us are struggling to remember.

As Cantu tells us what he learned, he bolsters his point -- that it's hard to comprehend the border from books. This one challenges the reader to find the meaning, or some sense, in its loosely strung episodes, fragmentary encounters with border crossers and agents, clippings from books Cantu has read and the surreal dreams that haunt his fretful nights. Cantu finds out that border agents are not so much college boys like him, but former cops and soldiers, migrants from cold climates and crappy jobs. Some new arrivals have no idea what's going on at the border, but all are primed at the academy for narco warfare, with lurid PowerPoints of people killed by Mexican cartels: heads in an ice chest, bodies stacked in a cattle truck. This is what you're up against, this is what's coming, the instructor says. Except it isn't. The job is often boring, chasing footprints, staring at monitors, shuffling paper. ""You don't want to bring in any bodies with your dope if you can help it,"" Cantu is told. ""Suspects mean you have a smuggling case on your hands, and that's a hell of a lot of paperwork."" The aliens we encounter are not narco bosses and murderous kidnappers but their victims: bewildered, disoriented, helpless migrants. Some are dead. They don't fit the terror profile. A weeping woman tells the agents arresting her that it's her 23rd birthday. She wants to be like Selena, and sings ""Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"" on her way to detention. A man found in the fetal position has been drinking his urine for four days. A fat teenager lies sobbing in a mesquite thicket; the group left him behind.

Each migrant has a wrenching story, but to agents these are just ""wets,"" or ""POWs,"" ""plain old wets."" Salvadorans are ""el sals."" ""Quitters"" are just that. Cantu finds two of them huddling in a church, a man and a woman. They had been lost for days, surviving on filthy water from cattle tanks. She is six months pregnant. Cantu gives them water bottles and asks their names, which he soon forgets. In case you think compassion is the rule, Cantu makes a confession. ""It's true that we slash their bottles and drain their water into the dry earth, that we dump their backpacks and pile their food and clothes to be crushed and pissed on and stepped over, strewn across the desert and set ablaze. And Christ, it sounds terrible, and maybe it is."" ""But the idea is that when they come out from their hiding places, when they regroup and return to find their stockpiles ransacked and stripped, they'll realize their situation,"" he adds, is hopeless. ""And they'll quit right then and there, they'll save themselves."" That, says Cantu, is ""the sense in it all."" Robbing migrants of water in 115-degree Sonoran heat to save them sounds like exquisitely tortured rationalizing. Recent news accounts and videos of agents destroying water caches suggest that Cantu's account is accurate, though the Border Patrol has also said it does not condone life-threatening vandalism. So whose logic governs? Who is lying, who has gone rogue -- Cantu and his buddies, or the agency itself? Later Cantu tips us to a secret he couldn't tell his own family -- that he and his brother agents ran like a mob of teenage vandals: ""I wanted to tell my uncle that I had known men to engage in senseless acts of defilement, depositing car seats and furniture on far-off hillsides and in remote washes, decorating cacti with women's undergarments, hanging twisted bike frames from the towering arms of saguaros, dislodging massive boulders to tumble down sloping mountainsides, and setting fire to anything that would burn -- abandoned automobiles and trash piles and proud desert plants left to smoke and smolder through the night."" They sound like poorly trained men with not enough to do. Yet this is a glancing admission, slipped passively into the narrative without elaboration. Cantu recounts moments of tender connection with frightened, injured border crossers. But he seems unwilling to look too closely at his complicity in despicable behavior, leaving a reader to worry about the fate of that close-up quest for enlightenment he told his mother he was after.

We surmise early on that Cantu, his psyche under strain, is not long for the job. He loses sleep, he grinds his teeth, he has bad dreams about wolves. Then the book shifts abruptly. Cantu leaves the agency. Now he's a barista and studying for a master's degree. But here, finally, he takes us deep into a border story -- that of his new friend Jose, 30 years in the United States, nabbed by the Border Patrol after returning from Mexico, where he had gone to see his dying mother. The last third of the book, as Jose and his family desperately fight his deportation, with Cantu's considerable help, makes a useful contribution to the literature of today's border. It lays bare, in damning light, the casual brutality of the system, how unjust laws and private prisons and a militarized border have shattered families and mocked America's myths about itself. ""We mostly arrested the little people,"" Cantu tells Jose. ""Smugglers, scouts, mules, coyotes. But mostly I arrested migrants, I confessed. People looking for a better life."" He should have listened to his mother."
27446,Hair Dyes and Straighteners May Raise Breast Cancer Risk for Black Women,A new study finds a weak link between coloring and straightening treatments and breast cancer. But experts caution the results are far from certain.,"""The take-home message is that these risks are potentially important, but we know that a lot of different factors contribute to a woman's risk of breast cancer,"" said one of the study's authors.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/science/04HAIRDYE1/04HAIRDYE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=822430dee461d8e2adbd8033c69b8b5449fffe2a8fcb08f564738857ebbcfab8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/health/cancer-hair-dye-black-women.html,e8d41f0c-6f96-58dc-b8c3-871283f322c9.jpg,"For decades, scientists have debated whether hair dyes frequently used by women might contribute to cancer. The research has been mixed and inconclusive, but now government investigators have turned up a disturbing new possibility. Black women who regularly used permanent dyes to color their hair were 60 percent more likely to develop breast cancer, compared to black women who did not report using dye, according to an analysis published this week in The International Journal of Cancer. White women using hair dye did not see a significantly increased risk. The reasons are unclear: It may be because different products are designed for women of different ethnic and racial backgrounds, or that variations in hair texture alter the amounts of dye that are applied or absorbed through the skin. The study also implicated hair straighteners, finding a 30 percent increase in the risk of breast cancer among women of all races who reported regular use of the products . African-American women were much more likely than white women to use hair straighteners, the researchers noted.

The analysis does not prove hair treatments cause breast cancer, several experts said, and the overall risk for African-American women is difficult to know. Fewer than 10 percent of the study's participants were black women, their use of hair products was assessed only once, and they were tracked for just eight years on average. Progress in the field. In recent years, advancements in research have changed the way cancer is treated. Here are some recent updates: Uterine cancer. Women who use chemical hair straighteners frequently could have a higher risk of developing uterine cancer than women who have never used the products, according to new findings from a national study that has followed nearly 34,000 U.S. women for more than a decade. Breast cancer. A new study suggests surgery may not always be necessary for all breast cancer patients. A small early-stage clinical trial found that a carefully selected group of patients who responded remarkably well to chemotherapy could skip surgery altogether. Cancer vaccines. For a long time, the promise of cancer vaccines that would protect healthy people at high risk of cancer has only dangled in front of researchers. Now, though, encouraging animal data and preliminary studies in human patients are making some doctors feel optimistic. Rectal cancer. A small trial that saw 18 rectal cancer patients taking the same drug, dostarlimab, appears to have produced an astonishing result: The cancer vanished in every single participant. Experts believe that this study is the first in history to have achieved such results. Generally, scientists become concerned when an environmental exposure doubles or triples cancer risk, meaning the relative risk rises by 100 percent or more. The figures reported in the new study fall short of that threshold. ""You cannot, based on these data, make the statement that hair dyes and straighteners cause breast cancer,"" said Dr. Larry Norton, medical director of the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ""These effects were small."" Still, some scientists said the findings were concerning because of how popular h air products are. In the study, more than half said they had used hair dye, and nearly three-quarters of black women reported using hair straighteners. ""Our advice is that if you want to take a cautionary approach, limiting the use of these types of products is warranted,"" said Robin Dodson, a research scientist at the Silent Spring Institute in Newton, Mass., who studies environmental risks to women's health.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] She has identified several chemicals that mimic the hormone estrogen in hair straighteners used by black women, including parabens, commonly used as a preservative, and some banned by the European Union. Estrogen can fuel some types of breast cancer. ""Most products put out there on the market today are not adequately tested for safety, and they aren't tested for endocrine-disrupting chemicals,"" Dr. Dodson said, referring to additives that interfere with hormones in the body. ""Most people are very surprised to learn that there's nobody really minding the store."" The new study, carried out by scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of the N.I.H., relied on data from 46,709 women in the so-called Sister Study. Participants were between the ages of 35 and 74 and living in the United States from 2003 to 2009. None had breast cancer at the start of the study, but all had at least one sister who had breast cancer -- meaning that subjects, too, were at elevated risk. The women were asked about their use of hair treatments when they first enrolled in the study. They were followed over an average of eight years, during which 2,794 breast cancers were diagnosed.

48874,"For City Ballet, a Balanchine Season of Renewal","This company has been dancing ""Ballo della Regina"" and other works of its founder, George Balanchine, during its spring season.","Tyler Angle and Teresa Reichlen of New York City Ballet in ""Vienna Waltzes,"" part of the company's repertory.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/12/arts/12NYCBNOTEBOOK/12NYCBNOTEBOOK-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=d85bf914f316df1308944ef2e5ee6460797daa5da81fd9a07ca89a7bacba8e46&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/arts/dance/for-city-ballet-a-balanchine-season-of-renewal.html,48468fb8-cf8e-51ab-9d44-0e6ed635ebda.jpg,"New York City Ballet has been renewing itself at all levels in its current six-week season, which is now in its fourth week. Dancers in the corps have shown exceptional talent in lead roles, notably that zephyr Joseph Gordon in ""Symphony in Three Movements"" (seen on May 5), the tall powerhouse Emily Kikta as the soloist in ""Rubies,"" the impishly ebullient Indiana Woodward in the pas de trois of ""Emeralds"" (both May 1). On Tuesday, its senior ballerina, Maria Kowroski, returned to the stage after childbirth, almost a year after her last performance. She's the same tall and slender vision as ever, but with a newly free expansiveness.

And City Ballet has been renewing the ballets of its founder-choreographer George Balanchine. He made the three ballets I've mentioned; he also made all three ballets in the triple bill that entered repertory last week. The three -- ""Ballo della Regina,"" ""Kammermusik No. 2,"" and ""Vienna Waltzes"", utterly unalike -- comprise the richest fare of the whole season. The program's diversity and mastery astounds.

""Ballo"" (""Ballet for the Queen""), set to ballet music from Giuseppe Verdi's opera ""Don Carlos,"" is virtuoso classicism, in which outgoing allegro technique is taken to an exceptional peak of exuberance. Verdi's ballet depicts the discovery of the celebrated pear-shaped white pearl La Peregrina (which Richard Burton later gave to Elizabeth Taylor). The twist in ""Don Carlos"" is that, although the dance is intended to honor Queen Elizabeth of Spain, she has absented herself from the celebrations. Instead, the woman who presides over the opera's dance spectacle is her lady-in-waiting, Princess Eboli (wearing the queen's mask), who sings with excitement of her chance to be queen for a single night.

Though Balanchine's plotless blue-and-white ballet shows you no pearl and no princess, you can feel multiple layers of that drama evoked by the poetry of his steps: pearl-fishing through plashing waters, grand royal processions, exultance in the fleeting moment. Feet sparkle, arms stretch wide. We hardly know which element we're in. A cavalier, immediately after promenading his ballerina, beats his legs in the air (a cabriole)."

For that spectacle we mainly thank Detroit, where a swinging-'60s John DeLorean helped kick off the muscle-car craze by packing carburetors and cubic inches into the Pontiac Tempest, birthing the GTO. In the decades that followed, though, it was BMW -- specifically its performance-obsessed M division, recently turned 40 -- that established a dynasty of factory-built sport sedans that could hurtle, handle and stop as well as many sports cars. Now an expanding list of companies -- including Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac, Audi, even Jaguar and Volvo -- is tag-teaming BMW with their own oiled-up challengers. No longer is the supremacy of a new BMW M car a given; a wealth of well-bred competitors lets shoppers run their compare-and-contrast drills before they reflexively hand over huge sums to BMW. With the new, mechanically related M5 sedan, M6 coupe and convertible, BMW is making the case that enthusiast's dollars should continue flowing waist-deep into its vaults. This autobahn threesome, especially the low and flowing M6 coupe, makes a dazzling street-corner come-on. These M cars are stars in the mold of the ""Six Million Dollar Man.""

Or six figures at least: all are radically altered and upgraded from their mortal donor models, even in places you might not expect. And while the bionic Steve Austin sprinted at 60 m.p.h. in that '70s sci-fi show, I'll bet he couldn't get there in 3.7 seconds, as magazine tests have recorded for the M's. Such ruthless urge, in cars as stout as German butchers (these Ms range from about 4,250 to 4,500 pounds), is supplied by a 4.4-liter V-8 of NASA-level intricacy. With its pair of Honeywell turbochargers, the novel reverse-layout TwinPower engine -- the exhaust pulses that spin the turbos come from inside the V of the cylinder banks, while air enters from the outer sides -- dials up a lusty 560 horsepower and 500 pound-feet of torque, sending the V-10 of the last M5 shrieking to the dustbin. Yet as with some recent BMWs, these cars have familiar issues, starting with their gasp-inducing window stickers: $123,345 for my option-rich M6 coupe test car (base price was $108,295, including the $1,300 gas guzzler tax); $127,095 for an M6 convertible (starting at $115,295); and $103,195 for the M5 ($91,695 base). Technological headaches include a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission that stumbles like a wino in low-speed city maneuvers (though the M5 is available with a 6-speed manual). And regrettably for the brand that virtually patented the man-machine connection, there's a sense that technical proficiency has upstaged old-time BMW fun. As they devour the road, taming every difficult passage, these M's are tuxedo-clad prodigies in a hushed concert hall. The performance amazes, but you find yourself craving the raw, rude fire of the Beastie Boys. Given that the M6 convertible drives much like the hardtop -- a little heavier, a little draftier -- I'll focus here on the M6 coupe and M5 sedan. (That said, the soft-top M6 is one of the tightest convertibles I've ever experienced and one of the quietest in top-down drives).

With their rippling bodies, predatory air inlets and sported-up interiors, the cars of this M brigade visibly outrank the non-M models. Of the three machines, I took an instant shine to the M6 coupe for its looks, performance and gran turismo bearing. At these prices, the M5 seems to be outgrowing its 28-year mission as the do-it-all sport sedan. If you must drop $100,000 to go fast, is a midsize 4-door really the goal? Buy a $60,000 528i and a sports car for weekends. The M6 drops all the pretense, combining decadence and brutality in a way the sedan can't match. It's a propulsive German warhead, engineered to shatter your gated subdivision, though tastefully. And it looks best in black. The sedan's interior is excellent, but the coupe gets more padded leather than a Berlin nightclub. Likewise, the more prominent seat bolsters of the M6, along with the fat-grip, slim-spoke steering wheel, make a stronger ode to high velocity.

Naturally, these specialized M's are subject to fuel economy and emissions standards. So like the tuner-shop entries from competing automakers -- the Audi S6 and Mercedes E63 AMG, for example -- BMW switched to a downsized V-8 that gains 60 horsepower, with a 25 percent improvement in fuel economy, over the old M5's 8,700-r.p.m. V-10. This TwinPower is the first M engine with BMW's Valvetronic system, which improves breathing, response and economy by electronically adjusting the 16 air-intake valves to throttle the engine. Direct fuel injection made it possible for the compression ratio to be increased to 10:1, and the turbochargers operate at an urgent 21.7 pounds per square inch of boost pressure.

The M engineers devised a clever plumbing arrangement to assure a steady flow of exhaust gases feeding the turbochargers nestled in the engine's V. The short path from the exhaust valves to the turbos also minimizes heat loss. The result: nearly zero turbo lag, and a power curve that looks more like an flatlined EKG. Torque peaks at 1,500 r.p.m. and holds there until 5,750 r.p.m. Press the gas and the BMWs practically blow a hole in the atmosphere. These M's also add an engine stop-start function and an alternator that recoups energy while coasting and saves it in the battery. Fuel economy benefits, but it's all relative: 14 m.p.g. in the city and 20 on the highway is no threat to hybrid sales. The 7-speed paddle-shifted dual-clutch transmission is now fast and seamless -- that is, once you get it into gear. At parking-lot speeds, though, this has to be the most obnoxious transmission in any performance car, resisting commands and rolling on grades even when first gear is engaged. Its stubby console lever is awkward, and carving a three-point turn is an exercise in frustration; when parallel parking, the M's slipped or lurched, threatening to cream innocent cars ahead and behind. The M5's odd brake feel is another mystery. Around town, the pedal was almost hybridlike, with a spongy feel that suddenly turned grabby. There's ample stopping power, but it doesn't transmit many clues to your right foot. That iffy feeling was mostly absent from the M6 coupe, in part a benefit of its $8,700 carbon-ceramic brakes. I had the good fortune to drive the M5 on the racetrack at Lime Rock Park in Connecticut. Blasting around the 1.5-mile course, its power and grip were apparent, but so were its bulk and isolation -- especially when I moved straight into the sprightly, and far more engaging, M3. The M's, following BMW practice, bow to the gods of electrons, with adjustable systems for steering, suspension, transmission and stability control. There's a Rubik's Cube of possible combinations, but fortunately BMW provides two programmable buttons on the steering wheel to recall favorite settings. They are handy: in another fussbudget move, these M cars revert to the slowest, cushiest settings when you shut off the car."

Projected on a screen behind him is his brother Jerry, with whom he led the Fort Apache Band for many years.





Andy Gonzalez, one of the great bassists in Latin jazz, who in a career of more than four decades played with numerous influential groups -- notably the Fort Apache Band, which he formed with his brother Jerry -- died on Thursday in the Bronx. He was 69. His sister, Eileen Gonzalez-Altomari, said the causes were pneumonia and complications of diabetes. Mr. Gonzalez was a versatile player, as well as an arranger, composer, music historian and producer of other musicians' records. He embraced African, Cuban and Puerto Rican styles, various strains of jazz and other influences, often merging them into something fresh. The Boston Globe once called him ""a modernist preoccupied with tradition."" He grew up in a musical household in the Bronx; he and Jerry, a trumpeter and percussionist who was 18 months older, would practice together in the basement. Their father, a vocalist in his own band in the 1950s and '60s, was their earliest musical influence. Mr. Gonzalez played with the bands of the percussionist Ray Barretto and the pianist Eddie Palmieri as he was establishing himself. In 1974, he and the timbale player Manny Oquendo formed Conjunto Libre (the name was later shortened to Libre), a band that, mixing salsa and jazz, explored ""an immensely varied body of folk, popular and experimental music, without ever losing its New York Latin feel,"" as Robert Palmer put it in The New York Times in 1984.

Libre, with Mr. Gonzalez as musical director, remained an important part of the jazz scene for 35 years, releasing a dozen albums and advancing the careers of many players who passed through the group. Mr. Oquendo died in 2009. In about 1980, the Gonzalez brothers formed another pivotal group, the Fort Apache Band (named after a nickname for a Bronx police precinct house). It had a freewheeling style that mixed jazz and Afro-Cuban music in ""a disciplined bilingual inquisitiveness,"" as The Times said in 1995. ""This is New York music,"" Jerry Gonzalez told the newspaper. ""We play music influenced by everything we've experienced here. We play Mongo Santamaria, John Coltrane and James Brown all at the same time."" A key part of that adventurousness was Andy Gonzalez's bass. ""I can't think of a more fluid, powerful, and amazing rhythm section,"" the pianist and composer Arturo O'Farrill told JazzTimes in 2019. ""Those guys could stop on a dime and turn it around and do anything, float through space and gyrate and levitate. They really were the most important rhythm section in the history of Latin jazz.""

Andrew Gonzalez was born on Jan. 1, 1951, in Manhattan into a family of Puerto Rican descent. His father, Geraldo (known as Jerry, like his son), introduced his children to salsa and other types of music via his substantial record collection. His mother, Julia (Toyos) Gonzalez, was a homemaker who also did secretarial work at New York University and, for a time, for the F.B.I. Mr. Gonzalez was raised in the Bronx. In an interview with the website Herencia Latina in the early 2000s, he said he had played violin in his elementary school's orchestra. ""One of the bass players -- there were two bass players -- moved away, so there was a need for a bass player, and I was the tallest violinist,"" he said. ""I was playing in the second violin section. And so they asked me if I wanted to play the bass, and I said, 'Sure, I'll give it a try.'"" A musicologist who lived in his neighborhood and had a vast record collection, Rene Lopez, furthered his education. ""I was listening to Cuban music but did not know how deep it was until I went to his place,"" Mr. Gonzalez told The Globe in 1992. ""Then I became a collector myself,"" he added. ""In those days, there were some record shops that had 78s and were dying to get rid of them, so they would sell them to me at 10 cents each.""

Mr. Gonzalez was playing bass in bands while still a teenager. He graduated from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan and tried Bronx Community College for a time, but he was already so immersed in the music scene that he gave up his pursuit of a degree for the life of a professional musician. That included not only performing but also recording -- by 1995, The Times said, he had been a part of more than 700 sessions. He is credited on albums by Mr. Palmieri, Mr. Barretto, Tito Puente, Astor Piazzolla, Hilton Ruiz and countless others. His versatility as a musician was much admired. It was a trait he tried to impart to younger bassists, whom he sometimes found to be inflexible and lacking in musical history. ""They know one style, one way of playing, they play certain rhythms the right way,"" he told The Globe. ""But they don't know the whole story."" Mr. Gonzalez thought his playing career might be over in 2004, when health problems related to diabetes landed him in a hospital for two months. He played a recording session hours before being admitted. ""I could play, but I was so weak, I couldn't even take the cover off the bass,"" he told JazzTimes in 2007, ""so I asked somebody in the studio to do it for me. So I played the session, and then that night I called my friend to come and bring me straight to the hospital."""

A new study suggests that older people who are in a good mood when they get the shot have a better immune response.

British researchers followed 138 people ages 65 to 85 who got the 2014-15 vaccine. Using well-validated tests in the weeks before and after their shots, the scientists recorded mood, stress, negative thoughts, sleep patterns, diet and other measures of psychological and physical health. They assessed their antibody response to the vaccine with blood tests at four and 16 weeks after their injections. The study is in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.

Greater levels of positive mood were associated with higher blood levels of antibodies to H1N1, a potentially dangerous flu strain, at both four and 16 weeks post-vaccination. No other factors measured were associated with improved immune response.

The authors acknowledge they were not able to control for all possible variables, and that their observational study does not prove cause and effect."
33768,The Great Interview Magazine Caper,"Andy Warhol's magazine is dead. No wait, it's back! Inside Peter Brant's latest magic trick.","Bob Colacello, Jerry Hall, Andy Warhol, Debbie Harry, Truman Capote and Paloma Picasso party at Studio 54 in honor of Ms. Harry's appearance on the cover of Interview in June 1979.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/17/fashion/17interview3/17interview3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=711fa08ded0556f7a4910bd5e646ef174b98e748a98a9e00162a7559a1b4b424&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/style/andy-warhol-interview.html,a09b9340-506a-5de8-b855-ff708b7a889e.jpg,"Last November, Fabien Baron was trying to collect $498,000 in back pay for his work as the editorial director of Interview. The magazine's owner, Peter Brant, was in Kentucky buying a $2 million horse. Soon after, the magazine hired the freelance writer Brian Moylan to do a short piece on the celebrity figure skater Adam Rippon. He performed his services and never got paid. (His fee would have been $315 -- ""not enough for my rent but enough to buy a pair of shoes,"" Mr. Moylan said.) With folks clamoring for payment, it wasn't that surprising when Interview's employees were summoned to their SoHo offices in May and told the magazine was folding. Its parent company, Brant Publications, was filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, with close to 300 unpaid creditors -- including Mr. Baron, who earlier that month sued the company to recover his money.

Celebrity-focused print magazines have been on thin ice for a while now. Friends of Interview's founder, Andy Warhol, acknowledged that if he were alive today, magazines would not likely be his focus. ""He would have gone insane with the internet,"" said Diane von Furstenberg. ""He would never have slept."" Predictably, when it was announced that Interview was folding, tributes from Annie Lennox, Gwyneth Paltrow and Naomi Campbell came over Instagram. According to Mr. Brant, who would agree to speak with The New York Times only by email, the magazine ""could not survive the sea change in its industry."" He said that Interview magazine is a ""separate legal entity"" from himself and added that he put $7 million of his own money into the magazine over the last decade alone -- making him its ""biggest creditor."" But it's difficult to separate Mr. Brant from Interview; it is effectively a family business. Mr. Brant first invested in the magazine in 1969, the year it was founded, with his cousin Joe Allen. From 1989 to 2008, Mr. Brant's first wife, Sandra Brant, ran the business side. The editor at that time was Ingrid Sischy, who subsequently became Ms. Brant's girlfriend and then her wife. In 2008, Mr. Brant bought his ex-wife's share. Two of his children, with Ms. Brant, have helped run Interview. His second wife, the supermodel Stephanie Seymour, had a title there as a contributing fashion editor.

On May 25, Interview's chief revenue officer, Jason Nikic, released a memo that said Interview would rise from the dead under the ownership of an entity called Crystal Ball Media. The next issue, he said, would come in September. The new creative director would be Mel Ottenberg, a stylist who works with Rihanna. Interview, he promised, would be ""as beautiful, as creative, and as visually stunning as ever."" The president would be Kelly Brant, Mr. Brant's daughter and the magazine's digital director. This was a strangely confident assertion. To assume ownership of the bankrupt magazine, Crystal Ball Media likely will have to earn the support of a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. In all likelihood, Crystal Ball will have to to outbid other prospective buyers. But Mr. Baron was infuriated that a Brant might again run Interview when Mr. Brant's company ignored months of prodding to pay him his money. In a statement, Mr. Baron's spokesman, Zak Rosenfield, said: ""Peter Brant has proven to be an exploitive and dishonorable businessman who considers himself above the law, with his stewardship of Interview magazine the most recent example. It is now abundantly clear that Interview was kept afloat for decades because of half-truths, unkept promises and his exploitation of the passions and pocketbooks of contributors and staffers, some with meager means, who were eager to carry on the Warhol vision."" For a magazine whose paid circulation hovered around 230,000 at its peak, Interview had an outsize footprint. Warhol first published it in 1969 and used to stroll down Madison Avenue handing copies to passers-by. He threw parties for it at Studio 54. He carried a tape recorder in his pocket, which he used to supply Interview with content. It was first populated with film reviews by college kids. But Warhol's pop culture leanings, his ambitions to get fashion advertisers, and his interest in politics quickly seeped into the magazine.

""He was constantly trying to grab my crotch,"" said Mr. Talley. One day he and Warhol and Azzedine Alaia went to the movies. ""Andy was on one end and I was on the other, with Azzedine in between us. So Andy slowly snakes his hand across Azzedine's leg and onto my lap. I jumped up and screamed. Azzedine could not stop laughing."" Ultimately, Mr. Talley also came to find it amusing. ""It was not a Harvey Weinstein moment,"" he said. ""Andy was a charming person because he saw the world through the kaleidoscope of a child. Everything was 'gee golly wow.' "" Warhol said this ""10 times every five minutes,"" said Ms. Furstenberg. Others found that phony. Ms. Lebowitz said she stayed distant because she was convinced he was ""not a good influence on the young."" Warhol used celebrity portrait gigs to obtain cover subjects, and used cover interviews to pitch himself as a for-hire portraitist. ""He invented synergy,"" Mr. Colacello said. ""This was not ethical journalism."" Warhol could also be deeply cynical. Ms. Blond owns a May 1986 copy of Interview with Tom Cruise on the cover. Warhol had drawn a penis dangling from his mouth. She'd save it, wisely. Others were not as careful. From 1978 to 1981, Ms. Lebowitz was paid entirely in art. ""Let me assure you -- it was worth nothing then,"" she said. ""I sold all my Warhols two weeks before he died for virtually zero. And I believe that's why he died.""

When people gossip about Peter Brant, and they have been doing that for more than 30 years, a few incidents come up repeatedly. In 1986, the United States Polo Association banned him from play after he reportedly challenged an umpire to a fist fight. He filed a $30 million antitrust lawsuit against the organization and lost. In 1990, he paid the government hundreds of thousands of dollars after being convicted of a misdemeanor for failing to keep adequate tax records. This included billing personal expenses such as silk sheets, massages, and scalp treatments to his newsprint companies. He spent 84 days in jail, which was surprising to Ms. Lebowitz only because ""most rich people don't pay their taxes and manage to avoid going to jail."" In 2009, Mr. Brant and his second wife, Ms. Seymour, got into a messy and public divorce battle, where they traded accusations of infidelity and substance abuse. Hearings were set to determine how their assets should be divided, but the day they were to begin, Mr. Brant and Ms. Seymour waltzed into court hand in hand and announced they were reconciling.

Mr. Brant grew up in the Jamaica Estates section of Queens. His father owned a paper empire, and one of his close friends at Kew-Forest School was Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump and Mr. Brant ventured into Times Square together, and bought stink bombs, hot peppered gum, and plastic vomit. Around the time they finished seventh grade, Fred Trump found his son Donald's switchblade and sent him off to the New York Military Academy . While Mr. Brant was in college at the University of Colorado, he met his first wife and began using his family's money to buy art. That led to a meeting with Warhol and an investment in his magazine. For a while, Warhol and the Brants were close. They traveled to Paris and shopped for art deco furniture together. Ms. Brant took a job at Interview as its advertising director. ""They were unique among contemporary collectors in that their interest wasn't just about art,"" Mr. Colacello said. ""It was architecture, landscaping, decorating and fashion. They really had an aesthetic approach across the board. They were a great couple. And they had great taste."" Some people thought it was strange to encounter two people in their twenties with an ownership stake in a magazine. ""But to tell you the truth, I've never really understood what owning Interview means,"" Ms. Lebowitz said. ""It didn't make any money, and everyone lied about the circulation. I know that because when I was really young, I used to drive the magazine to the printers. I got fifty dollars for it. The sales they were telling people was like five times the print run .""

Mr. Brant pressed Warhol and his colleagues to keep costs down. ""He would question why we paid our bills so quickly,"" Mr. Colacello said. ""I said, 'We pay everyone within 90 days.' He said, 'No, no, no. You pay when the lawyers call.'"" A rift developed. ""He was a tough businessman and Andy wanted control,"" said Vincent Fremont, who worked for Warhol and later for Mr. Brant. In 1975, Warhol was struggling to finance the film ""Bad."" Mr. Brant agreed to provide $1.2 million and give back his ownership stake in the magazine. (It was supposed to go to Warhol's close aide, Fred Hughes.) Then, Mr. Brant decided he would invest only $1 million and made that contingent on Warhol putting in $200,000 of his own money -- perhaps not an unreasonable demand to anyone who's seen one of Warhol's films. Warhol refused, so Mr. Hughes stepped in and gambled his savings on the film. It lost a pile of dough and everyone felt burned. Mr. Brant began auctioning off his Warhols. ""I had to meet Peter Brant for lunch at the office,"" Warhol dictated for his diary in 1981. ""He was just awful. He picked out some prints, and now we're all settled with him on the money he invested in Bad and he never has to come back. Good."" When Warhol died in 1987, Interview was on hard times. Two years later, Mr. Brant bought it at auction for $12 million. His cousin Mr. Allen couldn't believe it. ""I thought he was nuts. I said 'why would you want to do this,' and he really didn't answer,"" Mr. Allen said.

Mr. Brant was occupied with his paper empire and his art holdings, which came to include freshly commissioned works of his wife by Julian Schnabel, Francesco Clemente and Maurizio Cattelan. (The sculpture Mr. Cattelan built in her honor was actually a legless, dead-eyed mannequin he referred to as ""Trophy Wife."") In 2003, Mr. Brant was accused of tax fraud in a civil suit by James Comey, then the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The art dealer Larry Gagosian and Mr. Brant, the charges said, set up a shell company to buy and sell art. After earning $17 million, the men declared the company bankrupt. Mr. Brant wound up contributing to a $9.1 million settlement with the government. Outwardly, Ms. Brant and Mr. Brant enjoyed a progressive divorce. But there were tensions, according to friends of the couple. Mr. Brant didn't always love being in business with his ex-wife and her girlfriend, while Ms. Sischy and Ms. Brant grew tired of Mr. Brant's drama. Ms. Seymour got bored in Greenwich as Ms. Sischy and Ms. Brant traveled the world with designers whose ad campaigns she'd once appeared in. As the marriage between Ms. Seymour and Mr. Brant turned into what one friend called a ""mansion on fire,"" Ms. Sischy and Ms. Brant decided it was time to gain some independence. They approached various publishers about buying Mr. Brant's stake in Interview. But ultimately, they sold themselves: In 2008, Mr. Brant gave them $15 million for their stake in the magazine and Conde Nast hired them to be roving international editors.

""I do not have a history of not paying my debts,"" said Mr. Brant in an email to the Times, adding that he feels badly ""for anyone that lost money due to Interview Inc.'s bankruptcy."" ""In the last 10 years, I loaned Interview, Inc. in excess of $7 million so that it could continue to pay its employees and the costs of its operations,"" he wrote. ""I never took out money from the business."" He blamed his creditors for the magazine's demise. Because people who hadn't been paid were suing to be paid, Mr. Brant said, he was left with ""no other option but to liquidate"" Interview's assets. ""There was no buyer that would take on the debt and liabilities of the business, and therefore no possibility that it could devise a plan to become profitable again in its current structure,"" he wrote. Bankruptcy laws don't require owners to assume responsibility for debts at declining businesses -- even when those owners live with their supermodel wives on giant Greenwich estates, surrounded by modernist masterworks. ""The purpose of having a corporation is to insulate against personal liability,"" said Susheel Kirpalani, a partner at Quinn Emanuel who specializes in bankruptcy and who was not involved in the case. But those circumstances do provide added opportunity for outrage. ""To announce plans to relaunch the magazine free of that debt in three months, with his daughter at the helm, is not only sinister, but a premeditated sham,"" said Mr. Rosenfield, the rep for Mr. Baron. Ms. Lebowitz simply shrugged. ""I don't have as much faith in rich people as other people seem to have,"" she said. ""Morals and aesthetics are not related. Surely you've noticed."""

It was Sept. 11.

At the Victoria Beckham show -- held downtown not far from where many, including two presidential candidates, were gathering at National September 11 Memorial & Museum -- attendees observed the two moments of silence before the first model walked the runway.

It was part of a formal recognition of how, every year, Sept. 11 falls somewhere on the New York Fashion Week calendar and how, for 15 years, designers and attendees have struggled with how to mark that day in an appropriate way.

This year, for the first time, the Council of Fashion Designers of America blocked off the 9 a.m. time slot on the Fashion Calendar -- roughly the time the planes hit the Twin Towers -- in acknowledgment, and donated $15,000 to the Sept. 11 museum."
